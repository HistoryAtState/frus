                        security considerations, all documents needed to give a comprehensive record
                        of the major foreign policy decisions within the range of the Department of
                        State’s responsibilities, together with appropriate materials concerning the
                        facts which contributed to the formulation of policies. When further
                        material is needed to supplement the documentation in the Department’s files
                        for a proper understanding of the relevant policies of the United States,

                        <p>1779. From an independent conservative source friendly to the Government,
                            I am informed that it is being recommended to the President<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d1fn1">Alfonso López.</note> that he declare war against the
                            Axis Powers, giving as a specific reason the action of Germany in
                            holding the Pope as prisoner. This source stated that the Conservative
                            Party would applaud the Government’s action especially as the Liberal
                            Party has in the past not been associated with a pro-Roman Catholic
                            attitude. It is felt that such a move would not only divert public
                            opinion …but would serve to unite the country.</p>

                                n="7" xml:id="d4fn7">Darío Echandía served as Acting President when
                                President López was in the United States from November 19, 1943, to
                                May 16, 1944.</note> today regarding the approval which the Senate
                            had given the Government’s expression of policy I inquired whether he
                            could explain as an acknowledged constitutional expert what the
                            constitutional significance is of the Senate’s action.</p>
                        <p>The President said at first he wished to emphasize why the Government did
                            not suggest to the Senate a declaration of war. He said that such a
                            declaration would mean the enactment of martial law and suspension of
                            constitutional guarantees and as it had been explained in Congress last
                            evening, such action was not even taken in the United States when we
                            went to war. On the other hand, the Foreign Minister’s <pb n="3"
                                xml:id="pg_3" facs="0017"/>declaration and the Senate’s approval
                            amount to a declaration of a state of belligerency against the Axis. He
                            said that this would bring about much closer relationships between
                            Colombia and those countries which had declared war against the Axis and
                            was exactly similar to the action taken by Brazil. Dr. Echandía said
                            that it would bring about much closer cooperation with the United States
                            and he hoped that an early meeting might take place between Colombian
                            and United States military and naval authorities with the view of
                            determining what steps Colombia could take in the common cause.</p>

                            privileges to the United States and asked how these provisions would be
                            affected by this latest development. Echandía said that privileges which
                            had previously been granted can now be amplified.</p>
                        <p>I inquired what would be the status of enemy nationals in Colombia, some
                            of whom we might wish to have questioned and interned in the United
                            States. The President said that the situation with regard to these
                            persons is now greatly simplified and even though the Government might
                            not feel that it could take steps without congressional approval, such
                            approval is already impliedly granted by the Senate resolution of last
                            night. He said that the important point in the Senate resolution is that
                            it promises to grant to the Government any steps which the Government
                            may feel necessary to take not only to repress enemy activities here but
                            also those of a military nature.</p>
                        <p>He said that he wished to call on me constantly now for advice and
                            assistance and I naturally placed myself at his services.</p>
                        <p>On leaving I inquired of the President whether his Government had
                            contemplated adhering to the Atlantic Charter.<note n="9" xml:id="d4fn9"

                        <p>2150. Minister for Foreign Affairs Lozano informed me this afternoon that
                            following a meeting of the Cabinet immediately subsequent <pb n="4"
                                xml:id="pg_4" facs="0018"/>to my call on the President today, the
                            following decisions were reached:</p>
                                <p>1. Colombia wishes to sign the pact of the United Nations and is
                                    sending full powers to President Alfonso López to sign in the
                                    name of Colombia, it being the feeling that this will give the
                                    act a greater dignity and significance.</p>
                                <p>2. The Government will shortly issue decrees expropriating
                                    property belonging to Axis nationals as a subvention to
                                    recompense Colombians for damages committed by Germany.</p>
                                <p>3. A decree is to be issued immediately calling to the colors
                                        recruits for military service.</p>
                                    <p>Steps will be taken in accordance with resolution XV of

                                        in Colombia. Foreign Minister suggested that the United
                                        States and Colombia effect an exchange of notes to provide
                                        for the deportation of dangerous Nazi nationals.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the foregoing, the Foreign Minister said that it would be
                            very much appreciated if we would permit a few Colombian officers to
                            study military conditions at one of our fronts.</p>
                        <p>He also said that he would very much appreciate receiving definite
                            information from our military or naval authorities in the Canal Zone
                            regarding the investigation which has been made concerning the fragments
                            of shrapnel fired on the survivors from the <hi rend="italic">Ruby</hi>
                            from the supposedly German submarine. Lozano said that Laureano
                                Gómez<note n="12" xml:id="d5fn12">Leader in the Conservative
                                Party.</note> is adopting an “incredulous” attitude regarding the
                            nationality of the submarine and that any proof which we can furnish
                            regarding its nationality would be very helpful. I informed Lozano
                            confidentially that according to information received from the Naval and
                            Military Attachés, German mines have recently been found at the
                            Caribbean entrance to the Panama Canal. Any information I can officially
                            furnish him on this matter would also be appreciated. Lozano said that
                            Spanish Minister<note n="13" xml:id="d5fn13">Gonzalo de Ojeda y
                                Brooke.</note> has asked for audience which Lozano assumes is for
                            purpose of transmitting German disavowal of responsibility for sinking
                            of <hi rend="italic">Ruby</hi>. For that reason Lozano would appreciate
                            urgent reply.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I inquired whether, in view of his statement before the Senate
                            last night to the effect that the Government considers that German [<hi
                                rend="italic">Germany</hi>] is in a state of belligerency against
                            Colombia, Colombia is in a state of belligerency against Germany. He
                            replied definitely in the affirmative. He said his Government wishes now
                            to <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0019"/>act internationally exactly as
                            though it were in the war, but that for the internal reasons which the
                            President explained to me this morning it must be considered as a state
                            of belligerency. He added that for practical reasons there is no
                            difference between the two.</p>

                        <p>2162. Although members of the Government express cordial enthusiasm
                            regarding Colombia’s new international position and the liberal press
                            emphasizes the importance of the Government’s decision there is virtual
                            public apathy regarding latest developments. There are no flags flying
                            nor are there any public demonstrations. Having witnessed popular
                            enthusiasm following anti-Nazi action on part of the Yugoslav and Costa
                            Rican Governments it is to me almost unbelievable that life in Bogotá
                            can continue without any interruption whatever on the occasion of the
                            Colombian Government having taken such a momentous decision. The Consul
                            at Cali reports “a surprising <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0021"/>lack
                            of interest on the part of the local populace regarding Colombia’s

                            German submarine of the Colombian schooner <hi rend="italic">Ruby</hi>
                            with the loss of Colombian lives, the Colombian Government has
                            recognized that Germany has placed itself in a state of belligerency
                            with respect to Colombia.</p>
                        <p>I have been pleased to observe that the international position adopted by
                            the Government was approved and ratified by a large majority in the
                            Colombian Senate and that all measures will be taken to repel future
                            aggressions and to intensify military collaboration with the nations of
                            this continent actually at war.</p>
                        <p>This Government, in expressing its deep sympathy for the tragic
                            aggression of our common enemy which has resulted in the cruel loss of
                            Colombian nationals, regards with admiration and gratification the
                            declaration of the Colombian Government which exemplifies the historic
                            determination of the Colombian people to maintain the principles of

                            information that Colombia’s state of belligerency is considered
                            equivalent to Colombia’s being “at war” with Germany. The quoted
                            expression is used in the Declaration. In your discretion, please
                            consult Foreign Minister and cable reply. He will understand that this
                            information is needed to meet our responsibilities to the other United

                        <p>2213. I saw Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon in connection

                            Dr. Lozano said that he would see President Echandía at once and would
                            call me as soon as he had had discussion with him. He asked me, however,
                            to emphasize to Department that Colombian Government does not wish to
                            take precipitate action especially in view of the absence of President

                            give careful consideration to the drafting of the note to the Department
                            expressing desire of Colombia to adhere to the Declaration of the United
                            Nations.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that prior to confirmation by the President of the
                            views of the Colombian Government the official opinion is that
                            belligerency and a state of war are synonymous terms but that Colombia
                            wishes to make one distinction: It considers itself to be in a defensive
                            and not in an offensive state of war. In other words, he continued,
                            Colombia is not going to send troops to a second front in Europe or to
                            any other part of the world. He illustrated the difference between an
                            offensive and a defensive war by comparing a personal duel, as
                            recognized in certain countries, to an attack on a private individual
                            peacefully walking in the street. A duel would not be legally
                            justifiable in Colombia but a private citizen would be justified under
                                <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0023"/>Colombian law to defend himself
                            from a criminal attack. Colombia now considers itself to be in the
                            position of the private citizen attacked without justification.</p>

                        <p>It was decided that the most effective contribution which Colombia can
                            make is: (1) patrolling of Caribbean coast of Colombia between Guajira
                            and Turbo by Colombian destroyers and aircraft; (2) request us to make
                            survey as to possibility of constructing two or three airports on the
                            Pacific Coast and one airport on the Guajira. Minister of War expressed
                            entire approval of these two points.</p>
                        <p>It was further decided that General Espinel, Chief of Staff, and group of
                            officers will shortly visit Canal Zone to work out in greater detail the
                            manner in which Colombia can help. On the other hand General Brett
                            promised all assistance in instructing Colombian General Staff on
                            matters of intelligence, sanitation, et cetera.</p>
                        <p>I am gratified to state that the evident understanding, sympathy and
                            tactfulness shown by General Brett contributed greatly to the success of
                            the meeting and should greatly assist in the future in carrying on
                            further technical conversations.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of War did not raise the question of an increase in
                                Lend-Lease<note n="22" xml:id="d14fn22">For correspondence

                            that if Colombia is to patrol the Caribbean Coast effectively there are

                            necessary. General Brett suggested that this be taken up by Colombian
                            Embassy in Washington stating specific <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10"
                                facs="0024"/>need of whatever equipment is required. I assume
                            General Brett will report directly to War Department regarding technical

                        <p>It was agreed that General Espinel will visit Canal Zone from December 27

                                <p>“The German Government has carried out against the Colombian
                                    nation a series of attacks which have the character of
                                    unprovoked acts of war, thus placing itself in a ‘state of
                                    belligerency’ with respect to the Republic of Colombia. We have
                                    no responsibility whatever in this situation, but we cannot fail
                                    to recognize it, just as we cannot escape its effects and
                                    consequences.</p>

                                    aggression and to preserve its sovereignty, its honor and its
                                    rights. The Government does not feel that these measures should

                                    the ordered and regular progress of its legal institutions.</p>

                        <p>2302. Foreign Minister inquired of me today whether the United Nations
                            Declaration is considered by us to have the juridical status of a treaty
                            or of a mere declaration. Lozano said that the Government wishes to
                            determine whether or not it will be necessary to submit the adherence of
                            Colombia to Congress for the latter’s approval.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I would consult the Department immediately but that in my
                            personal opinion the declaration is not considered by the Department to
                            have the same status as a treaty as I did not believe the adherence of
                            the United States had been submitted to the Senate for approval. I
                            likewise said that from my experience in Costa Rica I did not believe
                            that the Costa Rican Congress had approved the Costa Rican
                            adherence.</p>
                        <p>It would be appreciated if the Department would telegraph me its views as

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Lane</hi>: In the Department’s telegram
                            1463 of November 28, 3 p.m. you were advised that the result of any
                            investigation concerning fragments of shrapnel would be communicated to
                            you as soon as possible, and subsequently on the 30th in our cable
                                1472,<note n="24" xml:id="d18fn24">Not printed.</note> the
                            Department stated that the shell fragments were being sent to Washington
                            for examination.</p>
                        <p>The Department has now received a communication from the Navy Department
                            that because the fragments were too small and there were too few of
                            them, exact identification was not possible.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing is sent to you for your own strictly confidential
                            information and only to wind up the matter as it is indicated in the
                            Department’s cable would be done. The Department feels that the question
                            of the fragments is now inconsequential in as much as there has never
                            been doubt of the nationality of the submarine and the Colombian
                            Government had so stated at the time of declaring its belligerency.</p>
                        <p>While it seemed desirable for you to have this information, it is our
                            belief here that the matter should be allowed to die, that no report to
                            the Foreign Office will be necessary, and that no publicity, certainly,
                            should be given as the whole question is a closed issue.</p>

                        <p>I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that the Government of
                            Colombia has decided to adhere to the Declaration by the United Nations
                            signed at Washington on January 1, 1942. This Government <pb n="13"
                                xml:id="pg_13" facs="0027"/>has sent full powers for signing this
                            document to His Excellency Alfonso López, titular President of the
                            Republic, who is at present in New York. In taking this step, which
                            constitutes a logical and natural evolution of her preceding
                            international attitudes, Colombia ratifies her willingness to cooperate
                            by all means within her power with the free nations of the world,
                            involved, like herself, in a decisive combat against the totalitarian
                            political system. In defense of the right and liberty of the peoples
                            unjustly attacked on various occasions by the German Reich my country
                            has been compelled to proclaim a state of belligerency towards that
                            Power and desires to bind itself closely to the bloc of nations united
                            in the solidary effort against the common enemy and to collaborate more
                            closely with the United States and the other belligerent nations of
                            America in the defense of this continent. I request Your Excellency to
                            take the necessary steps so that our plenipotentiary can sign the
                            declaration to which I have referred, and I ask likewise that this
                            action be made known to the Governments interested. I express cordial
                            wishes for the victory of the United Nations and for the increasing
                            prosperity and greatness of the United States and I repeat to Your
                            Excellency at this opportunity the assurances of my highest
                            consideration.</p>

                        <p>I have received your telegram of December 22, 1943 stating that in
                            defense of the right and liberty of peoples unjustly attacked by the
                            German Reich, Colombia has been compelled to proclaim a state of
                            belligerency toward that nation; that Colombia desires to bind itself
                            closely to the nations united against the common enemy and to
                            collaborate more closely with the United States and the other
                            belligerent nations of America in the defense of this continent; and
                            that the Government of Colombia has decided to adhere to the Declaration
                            by United Nations and has sent full powers for signing this document to
                            His Excellency, President Alfonso López, who is now in New York.</p>
                        <p>Colombia’s action in thus formally aligning itself with the United
                            Nations brings to thirty-four the number of freedom-loving nations which
                            have pledged themselves to employ their full resources in the struggle
                            against the common enemy. On behalf of this Government, as depository
                            for the Declaration by United Nations, I take great pleasure in
                            welcoming Colombia into the ranks of the United Nations.</p>

                        <p>28. If you consider it likely that negotiations for final arrangements
                            between this Government and Colombia on future conduct of rubber program
                            will not be concluded within the near future, such as the next 2 weeks,
                            it is suggested that it may be possible to reach some interim
                            arrangement pending the final outcome which would permit action now. It
                            is noted, for instance, that one of the principal bases for the view
                            that the Caja’s<note n="26" xml:id="d21fn26">Caja de Crédito Agrario,
                                Industrial y Minero.</note> monopolistic powers are unconstitutional
                            is that they include rights with respect to private as well as public
                            lands. It might be that the Colombian authorities would be willing to
                            allow Rubber Reserve<note n="27" xml:id="d21fn27">Rubber Reserve

                                rubber sources and the procurement of rubber were transferred to the
                                Rubber Development Corporation, a subsidiary of the Reconstruction

                        <p>These suggestions are submitted merely for your consideration and any
                            action on them is naturally subject to your judgment as to the probable
                            course of the negotiations. It seems clear that if advantage is to be
                            taken of the present dry season plans must be pushed as quickly as
                            possible.</p>

                            I conferred at some length with latter. On January 9 Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs Turbay called conference in his office. See Embassy’s

                            commitment relative to tire plant. They expressed hope that we could
                            make our cooperation available within one year. Ambassador Lane after
                            making statement relative to this matter requested me to state our
                            Government’s position based on my recent conferences in Washington. I
                            assured Colombian officials our Government <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19"

                            situation permits. I stated it would be very difficult to set time limit
                            within which cooperation would be available. We did not make any
                            statements that would indicate that we can change position previously
                            taken about plant. Dr. Turbay left for Washington yesterday.<note n="36"

                        <p>150. Reference my No. 132, January 19, 8 p.m. As La Spina is concerned
                            over the fact that the suggested exchange of notes relates only to
                            rubber and not to other strategic materials also, I discussed question
                            with President Lόpez last evening inquiring whether he had any objection
                            in principle to exchange of notes being all-inclusive. President said he
                            had no objection but he would wish to consult his brother Miguel. This
                            he did by telephone in my presence. President then advised me that
                            according to his brother the Ministry of <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21"
                                facs="0035"/>National Economy wished first to dispose of rubber
                            question, especially as Caja has as yet no authority to act as sole
                            agent for purchase and exportation of cinchona. Decree so authorizing
                            Caja has not been issued because of apprehension that constitutionality
                            will be attacked as was the case on rubber.</p>
                        <p>In addition to foregoing argument advanced by Miguel Lόpez it is evident
                            that Government would prefer to concentrate on rubber program before
                            dealing with other strategic materials for the following reasons: (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>), political expediency and bargaining advantage
                            of insisting on tire factory and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>),
                            advisability of forestalling further criticism of Caja regarding lack of
                            results on rubber program and friction with Rubber Reserve. Our position
                            is somewhat weak in now insisting on inclusion of all strategic
                            materials in proposed exchange of notes as we made no objection when
                            Turbay stated to us on December 23 that he would prefer to dispose of
                            rubber question prior to reaching an agreement on other materials. (See
                            second paragraph of enclosure of despatch No. 1332 of December 31,
                                1942.<note n="43" xml:id="d26fn43">Not printed.</note>)</p>
                        <p>I informed President that we are fearful that general strategic materials
                            program may be seriously delayed unless it is included now with rubber,
                            as otherwise separate negotiation and exchange of notes may be necessary
                            with respect to each strategic material in which we are interested.</p>
                        <p>President said he would have no objection to our discussing with
                            Colombian Government officials advisability of adding other strategic
                            materials to proposed exchange of notes.</p>

                        <p>96. Embassy’s 132, January 19, 8 p.m. Department has discussed memorandum
                            with Rubber Reserve and following comments represent our joint
                            views.</p>
                        <p>We have only three general reservations. First, the new arrangements <pb
                                n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0037"/>contemplate that Rubber Reserve
                            will obtain approval from the Colombian Government or various of its
                            branches prior to taking action with respect to individual transactions.
                            We believe that the program would be expedited if only general approval
                            were required and if consequently individual items did not have to be
                            submitted. Our specific suggestions are contained below as to paragraphs
                            2 (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) and 2 (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>). Second,
                            we are not clear as to the extent to which the Caja’s monopolistic
                            powers are terminated and free trade restored; as to this, see comments
                            on paragraph 2. Third, the tire plant, discussed later.</p>
                        <p>Following are specific comments on paragraphs of corresponding number in

                                    Commission will depend to a substantial extent on the

                                <item>Rubber Reserve is entirely willing to assume the obligations
                                    proposed in the named articles of the decree. It does not seem
                                    desirable, however, that the Caja and Rubber Reserve should
                                    together have exclusive rights to purchase within the country
                                    and hence jointly possess monopolistic rights. It is assumed
                                    that the Caja’s monopolistic rights will be terminated and free
                                    trade in rubber restored and that both Caja and Rubber Reserve
                                    shall be entitled to purchase at fixed prices but not to the
                                    exclusion of others, except that the Rubber Reserve might be
                                    designated as the sole ultimate purchaser for export. <list>

                                        <item>This appears to contemplate an orderly process, but we
                                            are somewhat concerned about the resulting delays. Would
                                            it not be possible to have these zones determined by the
                                            Commission, which in case of any disagreement would
                                            report the proposal to the Government for decision. We
                                            also suggest that it is unnecessary to institute any
                                            licensing system and that a recorded approval will be
                                            sufficient. The procedure set forth in your (<hi

                                            Rubber Reserve contemplated any direct production
                                            operations or direct employment of laborers, but since
                                            its activities are to be limited to contracts for
                                            financing producers and contracts for supplementary
                                            services not involving direct operations, we trust that
                                            the procedure may be simplified.</item>

                                <item>We consider this provision undesirable so far as termination
                                    date is concerned. If it contemplates the extension of the
                                    rubber agreement beyond December 31, 1946, its adoption would
                                    require us to re-negotiate the rubber agreements with 15 other
                                    countries and colonies. We feel that this would have a most
                                    undesirable effect on the whole program. If it contemplates a
                                    termination of the rubber agreement prior to December 31, 1946,
                                    in the event of the cessation of hostilities prior to that date,
                                    we think it would deter the investment of funds in rubber
                                    production and the organization of enterprises for that purpose,
                                    since we regard it as necessary to have a fixed period of
                                    substantial duration to give the necessary encouragement.</item>

                            material required and made exceptional efforts to press for completion,
                            it would be impossible to give definite assurances that tire factory

                            <item>Highest priority equipment would be required for new equipment
                                consisting of electrical mechanisms, cables, switchboards, motors,
                                etc. Such electrical equipment is required for use in submarines,
                                torpedo boats, fighting ships and land equipment for the fighting
                                forces, and the War Production Board advises that it would be
                                unwilling to grant priority to obtain such equipment for additional
                                tire plants. Goodrich has been unable for 2 years to secure such
                                equipment to put its Cuban plant in operation, although plant is
                                otherwise complete.</item>

                            <item>Aside from new equipment, while there is idle tire equipment in
                                this country, it is impossible to be sure we may not be called upon
                                to put this equipment into operation to satisfy actual war needs.
                                For instance a Ford tire plant was recently dismantled and shipped
                                to Russia to produce tires for the fighting front.</item>

                                believed here that a small tire plant of the kind contemplated will
                                be uneconomical both during and after the war. During the war it is
                                doubted that Colombia can produce tires substantially more cheaply
                                than they can be obtained from Brazil. After the war the rate of
                                production in Colombia would be so low as to make it impossible to
                                compete with production costs of factories in other countries in the
                                absence of high protective tariffs. Even in Brazil and Argentina,
                                with much larger markets than Colombia has, tariff walls have been
                                necessary with resulting increased costs to consumers.</item>

                            <item>The procedures now established contemplate that Colombia’s
                                requirements for tires will be met from here or Brazil. The recent
                                arrivals from Brazil and the recent emergency shipment from here
                                should allay local doubts on this score. We are preparing a separate
                                cable on retreading equipment for Colombia. Initial studies indicate
                                need for two additional retread plants and if further investigation
                                confirms need we would be prepared to arrange export.</item>

                        <p>265. Reference my No. 150, January 23, 11 a.m. President Lόpez informed
                            me today that he has instructed the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            to proceed with negotiation of exchange of notes covering strategic
                            materials other than rubber. Am seeing Gonzalez Fernández tomorrow and
                            trust that conversations will continue promptly.</p>

                        <p>175. Reference your 142, January 20, 1943, 10 p.m. The Department and
                            Defense Supplies agree that the four proposed changes are undesirable.
                            If, however, some concessions along these lines seem to you necessary in
                            order to expedite the final agreement, there is no particular objection
                            to covering number 1 by revising paragraph 6-(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                            in agreement as it now stands to read as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Make available qualified personnel of its Air Force, Civilian
                                    Aviation Authority and other governmental agencies and qualified
                                    engineers to advise and assist in the program. The Defense
                                    Supplies Corporation agrees to furnish such specialized
                                    personnel as is not readily available in Colombia.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The Department feels, and Defense Supplies agrees, that, now that this
                            issue has been raised, it is very important to avoid giving the
                            Colombian Government the impression that we would be opposed, as a
                            matter of principle, to Colombian personnel however well qualified. It
                            would seem equally important to avoid language which might commit
                            Defense Supplies, in any particular case, to accept available Colombian
                            personnel as to whose qualifications there might be a reasonable
                            doubt.</p>
                        <p>With regard to number 2, it is assumed that there are ample public lands
                            that could be used or made available by Colombia for this purpose. It
                            would also seem that the proposed provision might open the door to abuse
                            and tend to establish a dangerous precedent.</p>
                        <p>Assuming that the new Rubber Agreement with Colombia will expire by its
                            terms December 31, 1946 and that it will not be renewed, the fourth
                            provision would perhaps not be objectionable provided an escape clause
                            for Defense Supplies, along the lines of the present <pb n="30"
                                xml:id="pg_30" facs="0044"/>12–(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), is
                            retained. Furthermore, when the term provisions in the Agreement with
                            Peru are finally settled,<note n="60" xml:id="d32fn60">See bracketed

                            not be acceptable.</p>

                        <p>326. To Rosenthal, Board of Economic Warfare, from La Spina. In our
                            negotiations with the Colombian Government through the Embassy
                            endeavoring to secure an over-all agreement given [<hi rend="italic"
                                >giving?</hi>] us the maximum facility in our strategic material
                            import programs, we are asking for the right to enter into public work
                            programs when necessary for the stimulation of production development
                            and transportation of these materials. We are referring to items
                            undertaken through the expenditure of development funds wherever
                            established. The question has been raised by the Colombian Government as
                            to the disposition of such public works after the emergency. Do you
                            approve as a matter of policy a statement to the effect that although
                            each project will be considered separately generally improvements of a
                            permanent character would become the property of the Colombian
                            Government whereas any equipment or facilities not fixtures would remain
                            the property of the United States governmental agency and may or may not
                            be made available at cost to the Colombian Government.</p>

                            Monday, March 1, the text of a proposed note from Acting Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs specifying facilities analogous to those recently
                            conceded for Rubber Reserve program which the Colombian Government is

                            strategic materials. These proposals have been worked out at the

                        <p>292. Your 326, February 20 and 348, February 25. Both the BEW and the
                            Department feel that the draft text of the proposed note is generally
                            acceptable. In fact, it seems necessary to suggest clarification and
                            amendment of only three paragraphs—3, 5, and 10.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that numbered paragraph 3 be amended to make it <pb
                                n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0046"/>clear that pending any agreement
                            regarding minimum price, we should have the right to negotiate for
                            commodities at the market, or possibly at the market subject to
                            adjustment retroactively when the minimum price is fixed. The proposal
                            is to avoid delays in procurement while price negotiations are in
                            progress.</p>
                        <p>As regards numbered paragraph 5, our general attitude is that permanent
                            improvements may properly go to the Colombian Government at the end of
                            the war emergency or of our procurement program on such terms and
                            conditions as may be present or hereafter agreed upon with respect to
                            each program provided it is clear that in the interim we will have
                            unrestricted control and use to the extent necessary for our procurement
                            program. As to equipment and non-permanent improvements, it is felt that
                            we should retain ownership without restriction or tax with the
                            understanding that it may or may not be made available to the Colombian
                            Government at cost or on some other basis. It is suggested that numbered
                            paragraph 5 be clarified along this line and provision regarding
                            re-export inserted.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that numbered paragraph 10 be dropped since the feeling
                            here is that it is impolitic to request the exemption provided in the
                            first sentence and in its absence there is no need for the second.<note
                                n="64" xml:id="d35fn64">This provision exempted the United States
                                Government and its agents from certain taxes.</note></p>
                        <p>It is assumed that U.S. Government procurement agencies are not liable
                            for the payment of corporate income taxes nor for the filing of income

                        <p>452. Department’s telegram 292, March 10, 7 p.m. The Department’s
                            suggestion for amendments to draft text of the proposed note have been
                            discussed with the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs. With regard to
                            numbered paragraphs 3 and 5, he indicated that no difficulty will be
                            encountered in harmonizing the text with the suggest[ed] amendments and
                            clarifications. On the other hand he strongly expressed hope that the
                            Department would still see its way clear to approving the retention of
                            paragraph 10, either in its present form or possibly amended, explaining
                            that from the United States <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0047"
                            />standpoint, he considered it highly desirable in order to avoid double
                            taxation to establish specifically on behalf of non-Colombian employees
                            the exemption from taxes which the paragraph would provide. While such
                            exemption might be taken for granted by the national authorities, he
                            said, complications might easily arise from the action of regional tax
                            collectors unless the point were made clear in the note.</p>
                        <p>From the Colombian standpoint he considered it to be similarly desirable
                            to include the second sentence of paragraph 10 to insure against the
                            possibility of future misunderstandings on this point.</p>
                        <p>In these negotiations the Acting Minister has shown a most cooperative
                            spirit and a desire to help in getting the strategic materials program
                            under way. Therefore unless the Department considers the objections to
                            paragraph 10 too strong to be waived, I should appreciate receiving
                            early instructions to proceed with the drafting of the note with the
                            inclusion of paragraph 10.</p>

                            objection to the inclusion of numbered paragraph 10 in the draft text of

                            agreement which was transmitted with Department’s instruction No. 763 of
                            November 10, 1942,<note n="68" xml:id="d39fn68">Not printed.</note> that

                            has been examined in Washington. Contrary to Department’s apparent
                            understanding no exchange of diplomatic notes on the air rubber
                            agreement has been effected. As this agreement is one case of
                            implementation of the over-all strategic materials agreement already
                            covered by and [<hi rend="italic">an</hi>] exchange of notes no
                            additional diplomatic exchange will be necessary. Signatures of Mayer
                            and the Ministry of War will suffice. Since it is impossible for Embassy
                            to make copies of agreement in time for this pouch it is hoped that copy
                            sent to Rubber Development Corporation will meet Department’s needs.</p>

                            substitution role of chapter I, subdivision (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>).
                            According to this suggested change Rubber Development is granted the
                            right to construct airports, et cetera, instead of being obligated to
                            construct them. In Urdaneta’s opinion which he again repeated to me on
                            August 2, subdivision (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of chapter I does not
                            legally obligate Rubber Development to construct airports because of the
                            qualifying clause “in such places as the Rubber Development believes
                            convenient” (the airports constructed by Rubber Development at Calmar
                            and Miraflores were constructed because Rubber Development considered
                            these locations “convenient”).</p>
                        <p>I am apprehensive lest the substitution in chapter I subdivision (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) will result in the Colombian Government’s
                            feeling that we do not propose to proceed with the terms of the
                            agreement as already agreed upon. As I explained to the Department and
                            to Mr. Stokely W. Morgan of Defense Supplies Corporation during my
                            recent visit to Washington, I feel it most important in connection with
                            our over-all relations with the Colombian Government to carry out in so
                            far as is possible the understanding which has already been tacitly
                            arrived at between Defense Supplies Corporation and the Colombian
                            Minister of War.</p>

                        <p>994. Embassy’s 1336, August 4. There is no disposition here to insist on
                            any particular phrasing, but both the Department and Rubber Development
                            wish to make sure that the Colombian Government’s understanding of
                            Rubber Development’s obligations under the agreement is the same as

                        <p>1392. Department’s 994, August 11, 11 p.m. La Spina and Mayer have
                            consulted Urdaneta who strongly advises against changes suggested in
                            letter of July 24 from Rubber Development Corporation to Mayer (see my
                            1336, August 4, 1 p.m.). La Spina and Mayer agree with Urdaneta that the
                            changes suggested do not essentially affect the sense of the proposed
                            decree and if insisted upon might seriously prejudice the issuance of
                            decree. At present Colombian Government is granting Rubber Development
                            privileges proposed in agreement in not charging landing tax for planes
                            chartered by Rubber Development landing on Government-owned airfields.
                            These privileges might be endangered by proposing changes or delaying
                            issuance of decree.</p>
                        <p>As original proposal for contract emanated from Defense Supplies
                            Corporation and as this was accepted by Colombian Government with
                            certain exceptions, which were subsequently waived, we have consistently
                            considered that Colombian Government is in agreement with our views in
                            principle. As evidence of understanding we refer to the Embassy’s

                        <p>1030. Embassy’s 1392, August 13. It is understood from your telegram that
                            there are no tacit understandings on the part of the Colombian
                            Government which would obligate Rubber Development to build any
                            particular airports at any particular places or to supply planes and
                            that the agreement is merely permissive in nature, authorizing Rubber
                            Development to take such action under the aviation agreement as in its
                            discretion seems necessary for the rubber program. If you are satisfied
                            that there can be no misunderstanding in this connection, the Department
                            and Rubber Development are agreeable to the execution of the agreement
                            without further changes.<note n="79" xml:id="d43fn79">The agreement was
                                signed December 27, 1943.</note></p>

                            had possession of the vessels for over 7 months and since the Colombian

                            extent, progressing failure to settle this case is becoming increasingly
                            embarrassing. In view of the circumstances surrounding this transaction,
                            and especially in view of this definite contribution of Colombia, a

                                printed.</note> suggesting additional changes in the bill of sale.
                            It is not possible therefore to authorize you to sign the bill of sale

                        <p>While the delay in this case is regretted, War Shipping Administration
                            feels that the suggested changes are necessary to protect all concerned,
                            particularly in view of the fact that the Colombian Government did not
                            take title to the vessels. In all other cases where the United States
                            had purchased vessels from the other American Republics the Governments
                            of those countries had taken full title, thus making the transactions
                            much simpler. Another cause of delay, and one which cannot be avoided,
                            is the necessity for matters of this sort to be approved by a number of
                            people.</p>

                        <p>The War Shipping Administration has, following receipt of the
                            above-mentioned telegram, sympathetically reviewed again the terms of
                            the Bill of Sale submitted with your despatch no. 1330 of December

                            the exchanges between the Embassy and the Department, a few revisions of
                            the Colombian text of the Bill of Sale are imperative fully to cover the

                        <p>The desired alterations in the text will be telegraphed to you within the
                            next few days with the reasons therefor clearly set forth. Because it is
                            not expected that they will be complicated or extensive, it is hoped
                            that they will be readily acceptable to the Colombian officials
                            concerned, in which case authority can then be given you to sign the

                        <p>616. Department’s A–600, April 2, regarding Italian tankers. In drafting
                            the proposed alterations, I request that the following points be
                            considered with reference to the objections raised in the War Shipping
                            Administration’s letter of February 25 enclosed with the Department’s

                                    with this Embassy’s despatch No. 1529 of January 30.<note n="91"

                                    from the Federation photostatic copies of the documents disputed

                                    of the opinion that no such request should be made since it
                                    could give the impression that we doubted the Federation’s good

                                    Department will recall that the original draft required that

                                    and that no objection was then raised by the

                            airgram no. A–600, April 2, 1943, and the Embassy’s telegram no. 616,
                            April 7, 1943 concerning alterations in the text of the bill of sale
                            covering the purchase of the former Italian vessels <hi rend="italic"
                                >Anteo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rapallo.</hi></p>
                        <p>Although it was originally believed it would be possible to telegraph you
                            regarding the revisions considered necessary, it has been decided it
                            would be more helpful to you to receive the letter from the War Shipping
                                Administration<note n="92" xml:id="d48fn92">Dated April 6, not
                                printed.</note> with the suggested draft indicating the desired
                            changes.</p>
                        <p>The changes made in the first and second paragraphs are, of course,
                            obvious and require no comment.</p>
                        <p>In paragraph 3 you will note that the bill of sale has been changed in
                            such manner that both parties rather than the War Shipping
                            Administration <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0054"/>alone declare that
                            claims, et cetera up to the amount of $1,500,000 would be for the
                            account of the Federación or of the Government of Colombia. This is
                            considered logical and it is presumed should meet with no objection. You
                            will note also that a new provision has been added providing definitely
                            for the holding of the purchase price for the payment of such claims and
                            providing that claims, other than those previously listed in the bill of
                            sale shall not be admitted or paid except upon the basis of the court
                            judgment or in such other manner as may be satisfactory to the two
                            governments. It appears to the Department that the reasons for these
                            changes and additions given in the War Shipping Administration letter
                            are sound and reasonable and that some such provisions are necessary to
                            adequately protect the interests of this Government.</p>
                        <p>It will not be necessary to raise specifically the question of furnishing
                            photostatic copies of documents. However it should be pointed out to the
                            appropriate Colombian officials that it is considered essential that the
                            War Shipping Administration be kept fully informed as to all debts paid
                            and all claims filed in connection with the two vessels in view of its
                            liability for all claims over the purchase price.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the change in paragraph 4, this has been suggested purely
                            because the administrative handling of such payments practically makes
                            impossible the completion of the action within five days. The War
                            Shipping Administration is reluctant to commit itself to a step which
                            could be embarrassing through non-fulfillment because of unavoidable
                            procedure with Government payments.</p>
                        <p>The change made in paragraph 6 is highly desirable since the statement
                            that the ships were in “the best of condition”, et cetera could not have
                            been factually accurate. If not revised it leaves an opening for
                            possible increased liability later which, it is felt sure, the Colombian
                            Government as well as this Government would wish to avoid.</p>
                        <p>While no change has been made in paragraphs, it is desired to call your
                            attention to the comment of the War Shipping Administration and ask that
                            you bring it to the attention of the appropriate Colombian
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>With regard to paragraphs, which has been added by the War Shipping
                            Administration, the Department understands this may not be possible
                            because it would appear that the Federación cannot obligate the
                            Government of Colombia. Therefore, if this article is not to be included
                            an exchange of notes with the Colombian Government along the same lines
                            might be the solution. While the present contract is between the War
                            Shipping Administration and the Federación, the Department is of the
                            opinion that the Colombian Government itself has some responsibilities
                            and obligations since the negotiations were carried out in the manner
                            directed by it.</p>
                        <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0055"/>
                        <p>It will be noted that the War Shipping Administration has in its letter
                            of April 6 in the second paragraph on page 3 indicated its readiness to
                            defer to the Department’s opinion if political considerations warrant.
                            The Department would prefer, however, to await the results of your
                            approach to the appropriate Colombian officials before assuming
                            responsibility for the waiving of the safeguards in the bill of sale
                            which the War Shipping Administration considers essential. Please inform
                            the Department by telegram of the decision concerning the proposed
                            changes.</p>

                        <p>744. Your 994, June 8, 6 p.m. In asking you to address a note to the
                            Foreign Office the object was to obtain from the Colombian Government
                            some statement in writing which would indicate the approval of the
                            contract by that Government.</p>
                        <p>The Department believes it essential to obtain such a statement in order
                            to safeguard the interests of this Government. It is the Department’s
                            view that it is immaterial whether this statement is obtained from the
                            Foreign Office or the Minister of Hacienda. In your discretion you may
                            address a communication to the latter embodying the contents of
                            Department’s 703 with appropriate changes in last paragraph and sign the
                            contract after receipt from him of a communication giving the desired
                            approval.</p>

                            approved the telegram.</p>
                        <p>I had no part in the earlier correspondence concerning the acquisition of
                            the vessels by this Government. As you may know, these Italian tankers
                            were seized by Colombian authorities when they were in the Port of
                            Bogotá and turned over to the Colombian corporation known as the
                            Federación Nacional de Cafeteros, which appears to be controlled by, and
                            in effect an agency of, the Colombian Government.</p>
                        <p>As you will see, the attached telegram relates to the completion of the
                            rather long drawn out transactions concerning the purchase of these
                            vessels from the Colombian Government by the Government of the United
                            States, through the payment of the purchase price already agreed upon,
                                $1,500,000.00.<note n="99" xml:id="d52fn99">The contract was signed
                                on July 30, 1943, and a check was forwarded by the War Shipping

                        <p>It appears that the Colombian Foreign Office has been seeking to take the
                            position that these vessels have never belonged to the Colombian
                            Government. However, as I told Mr. Falck and Mr. Keith, it appears to me
                            that it is necessary for us to take the position that the vessels
                            belonged to the Colombian Government (although they were operated by the
                            Federación) prior to their sale to the United States. Obviously the
                            Federación had no right whatsoever to seize the vessels in the first
                            instance, except as an agency of the Colombian Government. The latter
                            had a right to take the vessels when they were in the Colombian port,
                            although it will be necessary for the Colombian Government to give due
                            compensation to the Italian Government. If the Colombian Government had
                            never acquired title to the vessels it would not have been able to pass
                            title to this Government.</p>
                        <p>As to the question of interest on the payment to be made, I agree with
                            Messrs. Falck and Keith that (1) there is no obligation on the part of
                            this Government to pay interest to the Colombian Government, and (2) the
                            question whether any interest will ultimately have to be paid to the
                            Italian Government can be settled later on. Needless to say, this
                            Government cannot properly discuss the subject at the present time with
                            the Italian Government directly or through the Colombian Government.</p>

                            despatch no. 1294 of December 16, 1942,<note n="1" xml:id="d53fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> I have the honor to report that on December 22 I had
                            an extended conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr.
                            Gabriel Turbay, regarding the administration of the Proclaimed List and
                            the Interventor System, the substance of which I am reporting
                            hereunder.</p>
                        <p>I informed the Minister that the Department has expressed dissatisfaction
                            with the manner in which the Interventor System is working and
                            furthermore has indicated its displeasure with existing freezing
                            controls. The Minister stated that he was very glad that I had raised
                            these points as he personally wished to speak to me regarding complaints
                            again received by President Lόpez<note n="2" xml:id="d53fn2">Alfonso
                                Lόpez.</note> regarding the officious and tactless attitude assumed
                            by the Consulate in Barranquilla on Proclaimed List cases. Dr. Turbay
                            said that he would obtain the details from the President and would
                            transmit them to me in due course.</p>
                        <p>As to the Interventor System the Minister said that it had been agreed
                            last summer in Washington, between Dr. Miguel Lόpez<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d53fn3">President of the Caja de Crédito Agrario, Industrial
                                y Minero and brother of the President.</note> and Mr. Laurence
                                Duggan,<note n="4" xml:id="d53fn4">Adviser on Political Relations in
                                the Department of State.</note> that once the Colombian Government
                            had taken over the administration of a firm which had Axis interests or
                            dealings, such firm would immediately be removed from the Proclaimed
                            List in view of the responsibility thereupon falling on the Colombian
                            Government. I replied that I readily understood the logic of this
                            arrangement but that such a procedure should be conditional on the
                            Colombian Government effectively blocking the funds of the intervened
                            firm and controlling completely its activities. I mentioned then the
                            specific cases of Tedesco, S. A.; Ferrari, Riccardi and Ambrosi; La
                            Química-Bayer-Westkott, which had without hindrance imported 260,000
                            pesos worth of Argentine drugs; and the Almacenes Helda, which
                            regardless of its having been placed on the Proclaimed List had been
                            able to continue its business activities without hindrance.</p>
                        <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0059"/>
                        <p>I also stated that according to reports which had recently come to my
                            attention, Señor Gaviria of the Foreign Office had not effectively
                            carried on the consultative process with this Embassy which had been
                            established with his predecessor, and that therefore since July 1942 no
                            Proclaimed List cases dealing with Colombian nationals had been
                            affirmatively passed by him.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Turbay replied that the question of the Proclaimed List divided
                            itself into two parts: (1) Cases involving foreign firms or nationals,
                            regarding which the Colombian Government raised no objection whatever;
                            and (2) cases involving Colombian firms or nationals. He said that the
                            Colombian Government cannot, for political reasons which should be
                            evident to us, agree to the inclusion of Colombian nationals on our
                            Proclaimed List. To approve such inclusion would result in attacks on
                            the Government in Congress and would subject the Government to great
                            embarrassment. The Government’s approval would be interpreted by some as
                            a derogation of sovereignty and as a relinquishment of the Colombian
                            Government’s duty to protect its own nationals. The Minister said,
                            however, that there is a great deal of difference in the meaning between
                            the terms “approval” and “acquiescence”. His proposal would be that a
                            committee be formed comprised of representatives of the Ministries of
                            Foreign Affairs, Hacienda and National Economy and of this Embassy,
                            which would meet from time to time to discuss cases involving the
                            inclusion of Colombian firms or individuals on the Proclaimed List. In
                            the event that the Colombian representative should indicate that the
                            information on which we were basing inclusion was not based on facts, a
                            further investigation could be made by us to justify our position, as
                            presumably we would not wish to include a name on the basis of
                            misinformation. In the event that there should be no question as to the
                            soundness of our argument regarding the inclusion of a given firm, the
                            Colombian representatives, while not giving their approval, might
                            indicate their acquiescence or at least the absence of any objection on
                            their part. Dr. Turbay said that in his opinion the attitude of Dr.
                            Gaviria, of which we had complained, is probably due to the reluctance
                            of any Colombian official to give approval to the inclusion of a
                            Colombian national on our Proclaimed List.</p>
                        <p>As to the complaints which I transmitted regarding the administration of
                            the Interventor System, Dr. Turbay requested me to furnish a specific
                            memorandum on each case which in our opinion deserved censure. He said
                            that he would look into each case personally, with a view to taking
                            remedial action. I promised Dr. Turbay that I would have prepared
                            without delay memoranda covering the most outstanding cases in which
                            intervened firms had been treated with laxity by the Colombian
                            Government.</p>
                        <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0060"/>
                        <p>It was agreed between the Minister and me that another meeting would be
                            shortly held between us, possibly with the attendance also of the
                            Minister of Hacienda<note n="5" xml:id="d53fn5">Alfonso Araújo.</note>
                            and Mr. Livengood, Counselor of Embassy for Economic Affairs, so that
                            the problems facing us could be worked out in a spirit of cooperation
                            and frankness.</p>
                        <p>I should appreciate it if the Department would transmit to me its views
                            regarding the formation of a committee to discuss specific cases
                            involving the proposed inclusion of Colombian firms or nationals on the
                            Proclaimed List. I believe that such a procedure would serve to satisfy
                            any Colombian misgivings regarding alleged interference or arbitrary
                            action on our part and would, because of the representation of various
                            Ministries on the committee, be more effective than the present system
                            where one subordinate of the Foreign Office can through procrastination
                            hold up a definite decision.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s reply by telegraph will be deeply appreciated.</p>

                        <p>A–10. Reference my despatch no. 1301, December 22, 1942.</p>
                        <p>On December 29 I had a general discussion with President Lόpez and
                            Minister of Hacienda Araújo regarding policy of the Colombian Government
                            with respect to intervened firms. On December 30 I had, at the request
                            of the President, an extended interview with Ramon Santo Domingo, newly
                            appointed Minister of Communications. As the latter is from
                            Barranquilla, from which point numerous complaints have arisen regarding
                            our administration of the Proclaimed List, President Lόpez and I agreed
                            that it would be well to have a frank discussion with him. Following is
                            summary of conversations of December 29 and 30:</p>
                        <p>At request of Araújo I intend personally to furnish him on January 4 with
                            details regarding firms intervened by Colombian Government, with respect
                            to which Department has expressed concern. Araújo promised to go over
                            all details with care and to take drastic action regarding firms which
                            are being administered with laxity. He pointed out, however, that great
                            shortage of essential supplies in Colombia, whose economy is
                            non-industrial, and difficulty if not impossibility of obtaining
                            shipping space for needed supplies from United States makes it
                            imperative for Colombian Government to <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47"
                                facs="0061"/>permit firms such as Bayer-Westkott to import drugs and
                            medicines from Argentina. Araújo said, however, that Bayer’s funds are
                            completely frozen and that he would give me strict accounting of all
                            funds received.…</p>
                        <p>I informed Araújo I had already spoken to Foreign Minister Turbay
                            regarding advisability of our having general talk regarding status of
                            firms intervened by Colombian Government. Araújo suggested that as
                            Turbay is out of town over holidays, Araújo and I might talk alone on
                            January 4 and then later have further talk with Turbay. Araújo evidenced
                            great disposition to investigate cases and take satisfactory action.</p>
                        <p>President Lόpez having transmitted to me on December 24 complaint from
                            Governor of Department of Atlántico regarding attitude of Consul at
                                Barranquilla<note n="6" xml:id="d54fn6">Thomas H. Robinson.</note>
                            on Proclaimed List cases (President Lόpez was not specific as to the
                            nature of the complaint except that one case involved Caputo and
                            Company), I requested Consul Robinson to submit to me comprehensive
                            report. This report, which I showed the President on December 29,
                            indicates that Consulate had correctly carried out instructions from
                            Department in advising American firms in its district not to sell to
                            Proclaimed List firms. Santo Domingo, on December 30, informed me that
                            in his opinion no criticism due Consulate on Proclaimed List matters.
                            The principal complaint should be placed on Barranquilla persons who, in
                            order to ingratiate themselves with Consulate, furnish information
                            regarding their personal enemies or business competitors which the
                            Consulate must necessarily receive. Santo Domingo admitted, however,
                            that in his opinion the Consulate did not sufficiently investigate
                            information received.</p>
                        <p>After conversations with Araújo and Turbay I shall report to Department
                            further of developments.</p>

                            Meetings were held on January 8 and 12 with Minister of Hacienda
                            regarding Proclaimed List matters and especially with regard to
                            intervened firms.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Araújo, who showed a very evident desire to cooperate with us,
                            expressed agreement with our point of view in removing intervened <pb

                            expressed agreement with my point of view that in addition to the
                            desirability of the Colombian Government’s taking steps required as a
                            measure of continental solidarity in accordance with Colombia’s

                            keeping on the Proclaimed List firms which are intervened and
                            administered by the Colombian Government is possible cause for friction
                            between the two Governments, implying a reflection on the effectiveness
                            of the Colombian Government’s administration of such firms.</p>
                        <p>Specific cases were discussed with the Minister and his assistants, and
                            it was agreed that Mr, Derby<note n="9" xml:id="d55fn9">Robert Julius

                            the Embassy would take up with Dr. Bernal of the Ministry of
                                Hacienda<note n="10" xml:id="d55fn10">Pablo Bernal of the Juridical

                            the Department has imposed for the elimination of firms from the
                            Proclaimed List. Should there be any disagreement between Derby and
                            Bernal as to procedure, the Minister expressed willingness to discuss
                            the general situation or any specific case with me personally.</p>
                        <p>The question of the extent of the present Colombian decrees involving
                            control of enemy nationals was also discussed with the Minister and his
                            assistants. The deficiencies in the existing decrees were pointed out in
                            detail to the Minister, particularly with reference to the commitments
                            made by the Colombian representatives at the Rio and Washington
                            conferences. The fact that Law 128 expired on July 20, 1942, and that
                            the President no longer had extraordinary powers to control and regulate
                            the property and activities of enemy nationals, was also discussed. The
                            Minister stated that he was anxious to know definitely what additional
                            measures his Government should take to correct existing deficiencies in
                            the Colombian decrees, and that when this was determined, additional
                            legislation would be requested of Congress for this purpose, if
                            necessary. It was agreed that Derby and Bernal would discuss this phase
                            of the problem in detail and the results of their discussion would be
                            submitted to the Minister for his consideration and action.</p>
                        <p>I believe that these meetings have accomplished the necessary spade work
                            for a better understanding on the part of the Colombian authorities of
                            our desires, and have also served specifically to clear up <pb n="49"
                                xml:id="pg_49" facs="0063"/>certain doubtful cases. I am hopeful
                            that Derby’s conversations with Bernal will definitely and
                            satisfactorily dispose of cases regarding which Department has expressed
                            dissatisfaction.</p>

                            Department’s instruction no. 795 of November 19, 1942,<note n="11"
                                xml:id="d56fn11">Not printed.</note> concerning Colombian economic
                            and financial controls of enemy property and assets, and subsequent
                            reports and despatches from this Embassy regarding this subject.</p>
                        <p>At the recent extraordinary session of Congress of Colombia which
                            adjourned on February 28, 1943, comprehensive legislation, known as the
                            Economic Defense Plan, was enacted, providing for the control of prices
                            of drugs, foodstuffs, and merchandise ordinarily consumed by the public
                            and authorizing the Government to take the necessary measures to
                            accomplish the purposes of the law. The full text of the Economic
                            Defense Plan will be submitted in a separate report as soon as it is
                            officially published.</p>
                        <p>Articles 13 to 17, inclusive, of the Economic Defense Plan contain
                            certain provisions and authorizations to the Government with reference
                            to the control of property of foreigners.</p>
                        <p>For the present, it will be observed that Article 13 authorizes the
                            issuance of bonds in the amount of fifty million pesos, the proceeds of
                            which are to be used for the nationalization of property owned by
                            foreigners which is under the administration of the Colombian Government
                            and for the purpose of purchasing telephone, transportations, electric
                            power, and other public utility companies. This article also grants
                            extraordinary powers to the President until December 31, 1943, to extend
                            and amend existing decrees within the provisions of Article 16 of Law
                            128 of 1941. The effect of this article is to renew until December 31,
                            1943, the extraordinary powers granted to the President by Article 16 of
                            Law 128 of 1941, which powers expired on July 20, 1942.</p>
                        <p>Article 14 provides for the maturity and interest rate of the bonds
                            authorized to be issued by Article 13.</p>
                        <p>Article 15 provides that income from firms under administration, and cash
                            balances of such firms, must be invested when required by the
                            Government, in the bonds authorized to be issued by this law.</p>
                        <p>Article 16 provides for amortization of bonds and payment of interest <pb

                        <p>Article 17 provides for exclusion of nationals of territories occupied by

                            furnish satisfactory proof of good conduct and antecedents. This article
                            also provides for opening of bank accounts by Axis nationals and other
                            persons subject to Colombian controls where such bank accounts are
                            absolutely essential and the persons involved furnish satisfactory proof

                                Embassy.</note> It was explained that this government had found that
                            the discussion of questions relating to the Proclaimed List with other
                            governments was made more effective and profitable for both governments
                            when a consultative commission was created by the local government for
                            the purpose of discussing Proclaimed List matters with representatives
                            of the American Embassy; that such a consultative committee in our
                            opinion should be given broad authority to carry on such discussions
                            without the necessity of referring, except with respect to broad
                            questions of policy, to higher governmental authorities; that this
                            government would be willing to agree to submit all proposed additions to
                            the Proclaimed List to such a commission before taking action; that it
                            should be clearly understood that such submission should be made for the
                            purpose only of giving the Colombian Government information of proposed
                            action and affording it the opportunity to furnish such additional
                            information <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0065"/>as it might wish to
                            have the American authorities take into account in passing upon
                            Proclaimed List questions; that final authority with respect to all
                            action relating to the Proclaimed List must remain with the authorities
                            charged with its maintenance in Washington; that experience has shown,
                            however, that corrective action to obviate addition of particular names
                            is sometimes possible as a result of consultation and that deletion of
                            firms important to local economy is expedited through interchange of
                            information and views. It was suggested that such a commission might be
                            given authority to discuss with representatives of the American Embassy
                            proposals for increasing the effectiveness of Colombian controls.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Turbay expressed his approval of the establishment of such a
                            consultative commission and said that he would write to the Acting

                            he too had been approached by the Apostolic Nuncio<note n="17"

                        <p>Doctor Araújo informed me that it had been the intention of the
                            Government to set up the new Board of Directors of the bank as of April
                            1, 1943, but that in view of the interest of the Nuncio and in <pb

                            postpone for a week or two the setting up of the new Board of Directors.
                            The Minister added that pressure had been brought to bear on the
                            Government by the main office of the bank in Buenos Aires to allow the
                            head office to determine the composition of the new Board. Doctor Araújo
                            said that the Government had definitely refused this request, as
                            obviously such a move would facilitate transactions which are not in the
                            interest of hemispheric solidarity.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State refers to the Embassy’s despatch no. 872 of
                            October 2, 1942 and the Department’s telegram no. 33 of January 9,
                                1943<note n="20" xml:id="d59fn20">Neither printed.</note> and
                            airgram no. A–537 of March 12, 1943 concerning the establishing of a
                            consultative procedure with respect to Proclaimed List matters.</p>
                        <p>The Department approves the establishment of consultative procedures with
                            the local governments in connection with the Proclaimed List where it is
                            requested by such governments provided certain principles are agreed
                            upon as the basis of consultation. In this connection there is enclosed
                            for the information of the Embassy a copy of a memorandum dated June 27,
                                1942<note n="21" xml:id="d59fn21">Not printed; in this memorandum it
                                was made clear that the United States was to retain the ultimate
                                decision concerning the inclusion of cases and that corrective
                                action must be taken in appropriate cases, irrespective of
                                nationality, and with expedition.</note> which was accepted by the
                            Venezuelan Government as a basis for a consultative procedure with
                            respect to names on the Proclaimed List for Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>The Department would be glad to cooperate in the establishment of a
                            consultative procedure with the Colombian Government upon the principles
                            set forth in the enclosure.</p>
                        <p>It was on this basis that a possible consultative procedure in Colombia
                            was discussed with Mr. Turbay as referred to in A–537 and with Dr.
                            Miguel Lόpez during his visit to Washington last year.</p>
                        <p>Any procedure which would be satisfactory to the Department would not
                            involve the use of a preliminary screening process by an <pb n="53"
                                xml:id="pg_53" facs="0067"/>independent Colombian committee with
                            respect to Colombian individuals. It will be noted that point 4 of the
                            memorandum relating to the Venezuelan consultative procedure states that
                            listing or corrective action must extend to any person or firm
                            identified directly or indirectly with pro-Axis interests regardless of
                            nationality. It is believed that it would be highly undesirable to
                            establish any differentiation in the handling of cases on the basis of
                            nationality. While the Department wishes to afford every safeguard
                            against the unjustified listing of Colombian citizens it should be clear
                            to the Colombian Government that the Axis has not hesitated to promote
                            its plans through the instrumentality of firms having the nationality of
                            countries in this hemisphere and that the prosecution of measures of
                            hemisphere defense would be seriously hampered if any distinction on the
                            ground of nationality were allowed to interfere with the implementation
                            of the Proclaimed List program.</p>
                        <p>In discussing this matter with the Colombian authorities it should be
                            stressed that the final decision with respect to additions and deletions
                            in the Proclaimed List, which relates to controls established by this
                            Government, must rest with the Interdepartmental Committee in
                            Washington. In the deliberations of the Interdepartmental Committee full
                            weight will be given to any expressions of opinion by the Colombian
                            consultative commission and to considerations relating to the Colombian
                            economy. In the event that the Colombian authorities should request
                            representation on that committee, it should be stated that it is not
                            feasible for all of the American republics which have severed relations
                            with the Axis to be represented on the committee and that every
                            opportunity is afforded through the consultative procedure for local
                            governments to express their position concerning particular names.</p>
                        <p>The Department believes that it is of great importance in establishing a
                            consultative procedure to effect an arrangement whereby proposed
                            additions will be discussed with the consultative commission
                            simultaneously with the transmission of a report to the Department and
                            that it be understood that in the absence of the submission of further
                            information by the consultative commission within a period to be agreed
                            upon such as two or three weeks, the Department will assume that the
                            Colombian Government has no objection and the case will be submitted to
                            the Interdepartmental Committee on the basis of the Embassy’s report. In
                            the absence of such an arrangement it has been found that the local
                            government is sometimes prone to delay action on important cases by mere
                            failure to report its position.</p>
                        <p>The Department believes that it is essential to the successful
                            functioning of a consultative procedure that the consultative commission
                                <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0068"/>which is established by the
                            Colombian Government be given broad authority to carry on discussions
                            with the Embassy without the necessity of referring to higher
                            governmental authorities, except when broad questions of policy are
                            involved. Experience has shown that it is also desirable to establish
                            consultation on a basis of regular and frequent meetings. Through such
                            meetings it is possible for the Colombian Government to make sure that
                            the Embassy has full information concerning firms which are proposed for
                            addition to the list and for the Embassy to discuss fully with the
                            consultative commission action which may be taken by Proclaimed List
                            firms or by the Colombian Government for the purpose of securing the
                            deletion of firms in appropriate cases.</p>
                        <p>The Department also believes that it would be helpful if such
                            consultative commission were given the power to examine the adequacy of
                            the Colombian economic and financial controls and to make
                            recommendations with respect to needed improvements in such controls as
                            indicated by the Resolutions of the Inter-American Conference on Systems
                            of Economic and Financial Control. By virtue of such an arrangement it
                            may be possible to facilitate the reorganization of Proclaimed List
                            firms and to promote a solution of the unsatisfactory situation now
                            existing with respect to intervened firms.</p>
                        <p>For the Embassy’s confidential information, experience in Mexico has
                            indicated that the continuation of the interventorship of undesirable
                            firms is likely to lead to a serious undermining of the entire
                            Proclaimed List program in the country. The mere appointment of an
                            interventor obviously accomplishes little or nothing toward improving
                            the political complexion and activities of the firms but does offer
                            local firms an excuse for dealing with the Proclaimed List national.
                            Furthermore, unfortunate situations such as are referred to in the
                            Embassy’s despatch no. 1301 of December 22, 1942 and despatch no. 107
                            from the American Consulate at Barranquilla dated December 30, 1942<note
                                n="22" xml:id="d59fn22">Latter not printed.</note> are inevitable as
                            a result of the performance of their duties by American foreign service
                            officers in spite of the exercise of utmost tact. The Department is
                            solicitous that foreign service officers shall not be subjected to
                            unanswered criticism by the local government for the performance of
                            their duties in economic warfare measures in behalf of hemisphere
                            defense.</p>
                        <p>It should be made clear that the consultative commission should be
                            composed only of representatives of the Colombian Government for the
                            purpose of consulting with the American and British Embassies and these
                            Embassies should not, therefore, have members on the commission as
                            suggested in the Embassy’s A–12 of January 2, 1943.<note n="23"

                            Colombian authorities to nationalize enemy companies and would extend
                            all assistance and cooperation possible under present conditions.
                            However, at the present time Department is unable to express a definite
                            view on the basis of mere indications that tie-ups with corresponding
                            American companies are desired. In the absence of information concerning
                            the type of agreement proposed, the assistance needed, the type of
                            business done and products sold by the local firm, it is difficult to
                            present a proposal to specific American firms. Such firms in general
                            wish to know some of the relevant business facts before committing
                            themselves. Moreover, although the Department will not disapprove any
                            specific proposal merely because it involves a tie-up with corresponding
                            American firms, it would wish to examine the terms of such proposal
                            before passing on it. However, within the limits of our stated trade and
                            replacement policies, we will do everything possible to facilitate
                            technical and financial assistance to nationalized firms.</p>
                        <p>Please submit a complete description of the companies in Colombia which
                            would probably be involved in the replacement program, the type of
                            assistance they wish from the United States and, if possible, the terms
                            and conditions on which this assistance is desired. Please indicate to
                            the Colombians that the Department wishes to make the maximum
                            contribution to Colombia’s program and that any delays that may be
                            involved in collecting and studying required information would appear to
                            be warranted and, it is hoped, will not prejudice the nationalization
                            program.</p>

                            the Vatican has acquired in that bank. He commented, in fact, that the
                            acquirement of such interest appeared to him to be a cloaking

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to advise the Department
                            that recently Señor Gonzalo Córdoba, manager of the Bogotá branch of the
                            Banco Comercial Antioqueño asked the Embassy’s advice as to what action
                            he should take with reference to opening of irrevocable letters of
                            credit for firms on the Proclaimed List but under the fiduciary
                            administration of the Colombian Government.</p>
                        <p>It will be recalled that at the time of the reorganization of the Banco
                            Alemán Antioqueño and its change of name to the Banco Comercial
                            Antioqueño, one of the conditions to its deletion from the Proclaimed
                            List was that the reorganized Banco Comercial Antioqueño would not
                            engage in banking transactions with or for Proclaimed List nationals.
                            Close observation by the Embassy indicates that this condition has been
                            complied with by the Banco Comercial Antioqueño.</p>
                        <p>However, Señor Córdoba stated that from time to time he received requests
                            from the fiduciary administrators of Proclaimed List firms under the
                            administration of the Colombian Government to open irrevocable letters
                            of credit for such firms for transactions abroad. If the Banco Comercial
                            Antioqueño complied with such requests, it would be acting contrary to
                            the economic sanctions of the United States Government. If it refused to
                            comply with such requests, its denial would constitute a refusal of a
                            request made of it by an official entity of the Colombian Government
                            which has the Proclaimed List firm under its administration and
                            control.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed this matter with the Minister of Finance and he stated
                            that he would issue instructions to the fiduciary administrators of
                            Proclaimed List firms not to make such requests of the Banco Comercial
                            Antioqueño.</p>

                            Department’s circular instruction of July 1, 1943,<note n="30"
                                xml:id="d65fn30">Not printed.</note> concerning elimination of enemy
                            influence from insurance.</p>
                        <p>This Embassy has carefully considered the proposals made in the
                            Department’s instructions under reference and submits the following
                            comments in connection with the suggested program:</p>
                        <p>As stated in this Embassy’s despatch no. 3833 of March 11, 1942,<note
                                n="30" xml:id="d65fn31">Not printed.</note> concerning Axis
                            Insurance Companies in Colombia, the only enemy company now operating in
                            Colombia is the Italian company Assicurazioni Generali—Tireste [<hi

                                >Proclaimed List.</note>). The only change in the situation since
                            the date of this despatch is that the Medellín agent, Alfredo Miani, is
                            included on the Proclaimed List and it has been definitely <pb n="59"
                                xml:id="pg_59" facs="0073"/>established that the Cartagena agent of
                            Assicurazioni is Vicente Gallo Jr. (PL). Reference this Embassy’s
                            despatch No. 4076 of April 20, 1942.<note n="32" xml:id="d65fn33">Not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>The Embassy has been informed recently that the Banking Superintendent
                            (under whose jurisdiction the management of Axis insurance companies was
                            placed by Article 17 of Decree 147 of January 26, 1942, and Article 5,
                            of Decree 1552, June 30, 1942) has granted the Assicurazioni a renewal
                            of its license to operate as an insurance company in Colombia. This
                            action has been discussed with officials of the Ministry of Finance and
                            is now under discussion with the Colombian Consultative Commission.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that Proposal No. 1, to request each government to
                            prohibit all insurance and reinsurance transactions with companies in
                            enemy territory, would be adopted by the Colombian Government. As a
                            matter of fact, it is believed that existing communications control
                            measures in Colombia preclude such transactions, and in any event the
                            only company in Colombia possibly engaging in such transactions at the
                            present time is the Assicurazioni. No instance of Colombian insurance
                            companies engaging in insurance or reinsurance transactions with
                            companies in enemy territory has come to the attention of this
                            Embassy.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Proposal 2, the Embassy is now endeavouring to have the
                            Colombian Government take appropriate measures to eliminate the
                            Assicurazioni, the only enemy insurance company in Colombia, from the
                            insurance business. Insofar as directors, officers and other insurance
                            personnel on the Proclaimed List are concerned, the Embassy concurs that
                            the influence of the insurance licensing body will probably prove most
                            effective in securing their elimination. Furthermore, existing control
                            measures in Colombia, plus the licensing system, if properly applied,
                            are deemed sufficient to accomplish the desired purpose and additional
                            measures would not be necessary.</p>
                        <p>No instance has come to the Embassy’s attention of any Colombian
                            insurance company ceding, retroceding, or accepting reinsurance to or
                            from any insurance company which appears on the Proclaimed List. The
                            elimination of the only existing enemy insurance company in Colombia
                            will not result in a deficiency of facilities in Colombia.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Proposal 3 concerning the problem of the neutral
                            European companies,<note n="33" xml:id="d65fn34">This proposal
                                contemplated the routing through and subjecting to United States
                                censorship of all correspondence and records of neutral European
                                companies doing insurance business in the American Republics.</note>
                            this Embassy has no comment to make except that the proposed procedure
                            seems most desirable.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Proposal 4, it is believed that in connection with <pb
                                n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0074"/>the general plan, the local
                            companies in Colombia can be persuaded to agree not to insure any
                            persons on the Proclaimed List or any property in which such persons
                            have an interest, with the exception of the property of those persons or
                            firms under the fiduciary administration of the Colombian Government. As
                            the Department knows, the Colombian company, Cía. Colombiana de Seguros,
                            has in the past been suspected of writing new insurance for Proclaimed
                            List nationals and of renewing existing insurance for Proclaimed List
                            nationals. However, as stated in this Embassy’s A–276, November 17,
                                1942,<note n="34" xml:id="d65fn35">Not printed.</note> assurances
                            had been received from the Cía. Colombiana de Seguros that no new
                            insurance would be written on listed firms except firms under the
                            administration of the Colombian Government for the reasons therein
                            stated. It is felt that other Colombian companies will feel under the
                            same obligation to accept insurance on listed firms under Government
                            administration where requested to write such insurance by the Government
                            representative. However, it is believed that this is a matter which can
                            be worked out with the Colombian Government, particularly if provision
                            is made for exceptions in special cases. In this connection, it is known
                            that Cía. Colombiana de Seguros has in recent weeks refused to renew
                            existing policies on listed persons and firms and it is felt that this
                            company is complying with its assurances to this Embassy not to write
                            new insurance on listed persons and firms, except, as stated for listed
                            firms under the administration of the Colombian Government.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Proposal 5, only one case of enemy and Proclaimed List
                            insurance companies insuring property owned by United States or British
                            citizens, or property of firms producing war materials for the United
                            States, has come to the attention of this Embassy, and this case
                            involved one Harry Constantin of Bogotá, a British national. He was
                            instructed to cancel this insurance with the enemy company. The cession,
                            retrocession, or reinsurance of insurance by the various Colombian
                            companies is with United States and British concerns.</p>
                        <p>With reference to possible leakage through insurance companies of
                            information on cargos and ship movements to and from United States
                            ports, a full report in this connection was made to the Department in
                            this Embassy’s A–24 of July 30, 1942,<note n="34" xml:id="d65fn36">Not
                                printed.</note> in which the conclusion was reached that leakage of
                            information through insurance companies in this country can be
                            discounted as entirely negligible. The report contained in this
                            Embassy’s A–24 that the Proclaimed List national, Giordano Zollia, head
                            of Assicurazioni, was doing some marine insurance business which he is
                            passing on to the Cía. Colombiana de Seguros, has not been confirmed and
                            is believed to be without <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0075"
                            />foundation, at least insofar as his passing this business to the Cía.
                            Colombiana de Seguros is concerned.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Embassy perceives no objection to the application in
                            Colombia of the concrete proposals made in the Department’s instruction
                            under reference.</p>
                        <p>Additional personnel to carry out the proposal in Colombia is not deemed
                            necessary.</p>

                            the mission’s departure. Accordingly, it is suggested that you refrain
                            from discussing the details of the proposal with the Colombian
                            authorities. You may, however, indicate that in general the Alien
                            Property Custodian will attempt to work out with the Colombian
                            authorities an effective program for the replacement of Axis interests
                            in the drug and chemical field.</p>
                        <p>Please inform the Department of any reaction of the Colombian

                            telegram no. 1093 of September 1, 1943,<note n="35" xml:id="d67fn35">Not

                            being prepared in connection with the replacement of Axis drug and
                            chemical firms in Colombia. As was therein stated, in view of the
                            importance of the forthcoming negotiations, the Department has had under
                            consideration the question of the relevant policies and procedures. The
                            views of the Department are as follows:</p>
                        <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62"

                            <p>1. It is believed that direct preliminary discussions should
                                        be held with the Colombian officials to establish an
                                        understanding on the economic warfare objectives which the
                                        two Governments would wish to achieve in connection with our
                                        assistance in the proposed Colombian program. Your telegram
                                        no. 1443, August 20, 1943,<note n="37" xml:id="d67fn37">Not

                                        in line with the Resolutions adopted at the Washington and
                                        Rio Conferences) are mostly acceptable to the Colombian
                                        Government.</p>
                                    <p>It is believed that the general framework for negotiations
                                        should include the following points, established on a basis
                                        of a direct government-to-government understanding.

                                        <item>If any of the properties is sold or otherwise
                                            transferred, or if any funds accrue for any other
                                            reason, it should be agreed that the proceeds will be
                                            specially blocked beyond the reach of the German owners
                                            for the duration of the war. Should Colombia be willing
                                            to agree to payment of any such funds directly into the
                                            Colombian treasury without segregation and to await
                                            final disposition at the end of the war, that solution
                                            would be most acceptable. In any event, mere freezing of
                                            the account against withdrawals would probably not be
                                            sufficient since the objective is to block the funds in
                                            a manner which will insure that the owners cannot
                                            realize any present advantage by pledging the frozen
                                            accounts or by other similar means.</item>

                                        <item>It should be agreed that trade between the
                                            nationalized firms and any Axis or Proclaimed List firms
                                            will be eliminated. Elimination of supply contracts with
                                            Axis or Proclaimed List firms and a guarantee that such
                                            trade will not be resumed for the war period should be a
                                            condition of American supplies. Cancellation of such
                                            supply arrangements will be satisfactory if it is made
                                            to coincide with the arrival of sufficient American
                                            supplies in Colombia to take care of health purposes. To
                                            clear the way for replacement of Axis trade by other
                                            arrangements, there should be direct cancellation of any
                                            existing contracts with Axis firms under which the
                                            manufacture, importation, or exportation, or other
                                            distribution of the products involved is limited.
                                            However, the cancellation procedure should preserve the
                                            patent and trade-mark rights of the vested
                                            companies.</item>

                                            patents, the Department’s views are set forth in its
                                            circular instructions of July 17 and July 20, 1943.<note

                                            is believed, in view of the apparent willingness of

                                            cancellation of the Axis trade-marks or a forced
                                            transfer to desirable purchasers who would guarantee not

                                        <item>American assistance would also be conditioned upon
                                            elimination of Axis personnel from the nationalized
                                            firms. It is realized that a program for the elimination
                                            of Axis technical personnel will be largely dependent
                                            upon finding suitable replacements. However, it is
                                            believed that this Government should have the assurance
                                            of the Colombian Government that it is the intention of
                                            the latter to discharge all unsatisfactory personnel as
                                            rapidly as is feasible. In this <pb n="63"

                                            well also to raise the problem of preventing the
                                            discharged personnel from engaging in subversive
                                            activities and to determine what steps Colombia would be
                                            willing to take to insure that discharged employees
                                            would not become a source of danger to hemispheric

                                            contemplated forced transfer, the Colombian Government
                                            should agree to prevent the acquisition, directly or
                                            indirectly, of any interest in the vested properties by
                                            either Axis nationals or persons whose connections with
                                            Axis enterprises make it likely that they would be

                                <p>2. The Department has also formulated certain standards which it
                                    is believed should be met by companies which may make contracts
                                    with the nationalized firms. It is believed that these standards
                                    are not a proper subject of direct government-to-government
                                    negotiations in the same manner as would be the measures
                                    outlined above. However, you may desire to communicate certain
                                    of these points to officials of the Colombian Government and to
                                    officials of negotiating companies. In the latter category are
                                    included the representatives of the Alien Property Custodian. <list>

                                            vested companies should be in the hands of suitable
                                            Colombian nationals. Participation by United States
                                            interests should be limited to a minority financial
                                            participation and/or a management fee contract.
                                            Management contracts should run for fairly limited

                                            will not persist unduly. On the other hand, such
                                            management contracts should be for a period long enough

                                            combinations without Colombian consent, and a Colombian
                                            decision will of course be decisive in such

                                <p>3. The standards stated above in paragraph 2 are chiefly
                                        relevant to the situation in which an American concern may
                                        make a contract with one of the vested companies. It is
                                        recognized, however, that another and simpler method of
                                        bringing American supplies into the Colombian market and
                                        excluding Axis supplies therefrom may be the liquidation of
                                        the Axis companies and the distribution of American products
                                        through new or existing desirable distributors. In this
                                        connection your attention is drawn to the survey requested
                                        in the Department’s telegram no. 1071 of August 26,
                                            1943.<note n="39" xml:id="d67fn39">Not printed.</note>
                                        Thus, the Colombian authorities have indicated that they are
                                        willing to sell the Bayer inventory, to eliminate the Bayer
                                        trade-marks, and to discharge the Bayer personnel. Since the
                                        Colombian authorities appear willing to liquidate <pb n="65"
                                            xml:id="pg_65" facs="0079"/>the Bayer enterprise, and
                                        since that concern is the largest drug and’ chemical house
                                        in Colombia, it seems likely that they may be willing to
                                        take similar steps with regard to such houses as Schering
                                        and Merck.</p>
                                    <p>It may therefore be that the Alien Property Custodian’s
                                        companies, or other American companies, may find it simpler
                                        and equally or more satisfactory to Colombia to negotiate
                                        supply or management contracts with desirable Colombian
                                        distributors who have had no Axis connections, or to expand
                                        existing desirable Colombian distribution and/or
                                        manufacturing outlets. These contracts would contemplate
                                        active participation by desirable American companies in the
                                        Colombian market and the distribution of their products by
                                        wholesalers who were without Axis taint. At the same time,
                                        the Axis drug and chemical concerns would be entirely
                                        liquidated in the manner tentatively outlined for Bayer and
                                        the proceeds of the liquidation would be effectively
                                        blocked. Trade-marks and patents would be disposed of in a
                                        manner consistent with the Department’s circular
                                        instructions on trade-marks and on patents. Separate
                                        management or supply contracts could be made for those
                                        manufacturing facilities which the Axis concerns in Colombia
                                        presently operate. It is the Department’s understanding that
                                        the principal concern of this sort is the Behring Institute
                                        and the packaging and similar machinery owned by the Axis
                                        concerns could easily be disposed of to whatever desirable
                                        distributors might make contracts with American suppliers.
                                        Should this suggestion be followed, expansion of
                                        manufacturing facilities in Colombia would be encouraged,
                                        but on a basis which would envisage the establishment of new
                                        companies to carry on such manufacture, probably in
                                        collaboration with strong American drug and chemical
                                        houses.</p>
                                    <p>These suggestions have the primary and strong advantage of
                                        removing those numerous problems which flow from the
                                        association of an American company with a concern which has
                                        previously been an instrument of Axis economic policy. Since
                                        the manufacturing facilities of the Axis companies in
                                        Colombia are believed to be slight (with the exception of
                                        the Behring Institute) it is thought that there would be no
                                        particular loss to the Colombian Government in destroying
                                        these Axis distributing organizations. The necessary
                                        supplies could the more readily be brought into Colombia
                                        because no suspicion of an Axis taint would hang over the
                                        Colombian distributors. Such a course of action would also
                                        solve automatically such problems as the one of retention of
                                        the Schering name.</p>
                                    <p>The pattern above outlined is, of course, similar to the one
                                        being discussed by Sterling. It is believed that the Alien
                                        Property Custodian companies may well be entirely willing to
                                        take part in a program <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0080"
                                        />along these lines and that several American companies
                                        would be willing to bring into Colombia products, under such
                                        a procedure, which would more than take the place of those
                                        products now wholesaled by such firms as Merck.</p>
                                    <p>You should discuss this matter with the appropriate Colombian
                                        authorities. Should this approach be followed, in whole or
                                        in part, by the Colombian Government, such information as
                                        may be ascertainable on Colombian distributors who would be
                                        willing and able to go into the drug and chemical field can
                                        be made available to interested American companies. In this
                                        connection, of course, the survey requested by the
                                        Department’s telegram under reference will be extremely
                                        valuable, and should be forwarded to the Department as soon
                                        as possible. The Department of Commerce will then be
                                        requested to bring desirable American companies into the
                                        Colombian picture.</p>
                                <p>4. The Department considers it highly important that all
                                        desirable American companies be given an opportunity on
                                        equal terms to negotiate contracts for the supply of drugs
                                        and chemicals to Colombia, and for the management of such of
                                        the Axis companies as Colombia may decide to vest and to
                                        continue. For this reason, it is desired that the Embassy
                                        keep the Department currently informed of any negotiations,
                                        and that all relevant information be transmitted to the
                                        Department, so that American firms may be informed.
                                        Similarly, it is not desired to give the impression that the
                                        companies controlled by the Custodian—as carefully
                                        distinguished from the representatives of the Custodian, who
                                        are representatives of a government agency and not of
                                        particular companies—should be accorded special privileges
                                        in the Colombian negotiations. The Custodian’s companies are
                                        under the present control of this Government, and it may be
                                        expected that their attitude will be shaped by governmental
                                        considerations to a larger extent than would be the attitude
                                        of a private company. It may well be, further, that the
                                        facilities of the Alien Property Custodian will be useful in
                                        bringing about contacts with other American companies or in
                                        making reports which could be made available to the American
                                        industry. Finally, it is quite probable that the Custodian’s
                                        companies are sufficiently expert in certain particular
                                        lines that contracts with them may be highly desirable from
                                        the point of view both of Colombia and of those companies.
                                        However, the companies under the control of the Custodian
                                        are in competition with other American concerns, and
                                        governmental control is not expected to persist permanently.
                                        The Department, therefore, wishes to emphasize that the
                                        impression should not be given that companies under the
                                        control of the Custodian are especially favored, all other
                                        things being equal.</p>
                                    <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0081"/>
                                    <p>This attitude of the Department is clearly understood by
                                        representatives of the Alien Property Custodian in
                                        Washington who have, in fact, made preliminary inquiries
                                        among several other drug and chemical firms and received
                                        favorable indications that the latter would be interested in
                                        participating in the Colombian market. It has been indicated
                                        by the Custodian’s representatives, further, that the
                                        Sterling negotiations are not inconsistent with the
                                        negotiations to be carried on by the Custodian’s
                                        representatives and may, in fact, supplement these
                                        negotiations in a way which will result in mutual
                                        advantages.</p>
                                <p>5. It should be recognized that the standards described in this
                                    instruction are designed as preliminary guides, and not as final
                                    touchstones. It may appear desirable to modify them in some
                                    respects. Moreover, it is emphasized that final agreements with
                                    the former Axis firms, or involving dealings with those firms,
                                    are to be cleared with the Department before being finally
                                    signed.</p>

                        <p>1710. Mr. Robert Parrish, Chairman of the Coordination Committee,<note
                                n="40" xml:id="d68fn40">An agency of the Office of the Coordinator
                                of Inter-American Affairs.</note> who has a wide knowledge of
                            persons and conditions in Colombia, has submitted for our consideration
                            the suggestion that if the Department plans to ease restrictions upon
                            Italian firms in Colombia as a result of developments in Europe, we
                            should do so at once and not wait for the impact of events to force us
                            to do so. He expresses the thought that we should remove at once from
                            the Proclaimed List those firms against which we have the least adverse
                            information, stating that we will get much more credit if we take this
                            step now rather than if we delay until this situation is clearly defined
                            in Italy.</p>
                        <p>On September 23 President López asked me if I had any instructions as to
                            reconsideration of the position of Italian firms [and] Italian citizens
                            in Colombia, as undoubtedly this problem will have to be faced shortly
                            by the Colombian Government.</p>
                        <p>In recent weeks officials of the Banco de la República (the Government
                            entity charged with the administration of practically all enemy firms
                            and of the blocked accounts of enemy nationals) have been quite
                            insistent with officers of the Embassy in inquiring as to the
                            possibility <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0082"/>of the United States
                            easing restrictions on Italian nationals as a result of military
                            developments, and have stressed the desirability of unified and
                            simultaneous action in the event the sanctions or controls are eased
                            with reference to any particular group.</p>
                        <p>I should be glad to receive the Department’s telegraphic instructions as
                            soon as a decision is reached on this important question of policy.</p>

                        <p>A–1110. Reference your telegram no. 1710 of September 25 concerning
                            Proclaimed List policy: with respect to persons of Italian nationality
                            in view of recent events in Italy.</p>
                        <p>The Department will shortly; issue a circular instruction on this
                            subject. The following are current views of Interdepartmental
                            Committee:</p>
                        <p>It is important to bear in mind that additions to the Proclaimed List
                            have been made on the basis of pro-Axis activities and in no case has a
                            person or firm been included solely on the basis of German or Italian
                            nationality. Recent developments with respect to Italy cannot be
                            regarded as requiring any automatic change of status of any Proclaimed
                            List national.</p>
                        <p>The questions and suggestions of President López, the Banco de la
                            República, and Parrish indicate a belief that Italian nationality has
                            been a basis for inclusion in the list. It is suggested that you make
                            clear to them that such is not the situation but that persons engaged in
                            pro-Axis activities have been put on the list regardless of nationality,
                            including American and British nationals. In other words, persons have
                            been included in the Proclaimed List not because they were Italians but
                            because they were Fascists or Nazis or were working for an Axis
                            victory.</p>
                        <p>Before consideration could be given to deletion of any particular names
                            there would at the least have to be concrete evidence that the pro-Axis
                            activities which led to inclusion were no longer being carried on.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to forward a detailed report on the effect of recent
                            events in Italy upon the political sentiments of Italians in Colombia
                            generally and upon Italian Fascists in particular with special regard to
                            pro-Fascist Italians who have been included in the Proclaimed List.</p>

                        <p>A–1360. Treasury has learned from a representative of the Federal Reserve
                            Board, recently returned from a tour of South America, that the Banco de
                            la República is holding United States dollar currency in the amount of
                            approximately $45,000, allegedly obtained from travelers and the
                            Embassy, which it is reluctant to forward to the United States because
                            of the possibility of such currency being impounded.</p>
                        <p>It would appear that such hesitation by the Banco de la República
                            probably results from the uncertainty expressed by the Minister of
                                Hacienda<note n="41" xml:id="d70fn41">Carlos Lleras Restrepo.</note>
                            over the three conditions outlined in the Embassy’s telegram no. 1151 of
                            July 5, 1943. Substantially such conditions are included in the cut-off
                            plan as proposed by Treasury (Department’s circular airgram of April 7,
                                1943<note n="42" xml:id="d70fn42">See footnote 29, <ref

                            will soon be sent to the various Missions. However, it is believed
                            desirable that the bank’s doubts concerning the release of the currency
                            should be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy is requested in its discretion to discuss this matter with
                            the Banco de la República. If the Embassy is in a position to certify
                            the source of the funds under reference, the Banco de la República
                            should be informed that the Treasury Department does not anticipate any
                            undue delay with respect to its release should such currency be
                            forwarded to the United States for collection.</p>

                            with Mr. Laurence Duggan, Adviser on Political Affairs of the Department

                            be satisfactory it may be used as a basis for discussion with the
                            Export-Import Bank.</p>
                        <p>In general the proposal is as follows: That a corporation be formed as a
                            subsidiary to the Caja de Crédito, financed by a fifteen million dollar
                            line of credit from the Export-Import Bank, the loan to be secured by
                            the shares of the corporation. The Corporation would be governed by a
                            board of six directors, three to be named by the Caja and three by the
                            Bank. The personnel of the corporation would be named by the directors.
                            The directors would be mutually acceptable by the bank and Caja.</p>
                        <p>The following are the suggested projects as included in the amended plan:

                        <p>A–274. My telegram No. 572, March 31, 7 p.m.<note n="44" xml:id="d72fn44"

                        <p>President López<note n="45" xml:id="d72fn45">Alfonso López.</note> had
                            referred to the agricultural plan casually at a reception on March 27.
                            He had stated in a somewhat joking vein, although obviously serious
                            beneath, that now that the elections are over, the electorate is going
                            to demand of the Government some constructive progress within the
                            country, especially in the field of agriculture. He said he hoped
                            therefore that we would endeavor to assist him and his country. I
                            replied, in the same vein, to the effect that I did not wish to take
                            part in internal politics but that I would be glad to see what could be
                            done to help Colombia.</p>
                        <p>In view of the forewarning, I had with me the previous correspondence
                            when the President summoned me on March 31. I asked him whether he had
                            any concrete comments in addition to those made by his brother Miguel,
                            as reported in Embassy’s despatch No. 1390, January 13, 1943. The
                            President replied that he had some very concrete comments and proceeded
                            to give them to me: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                <p>There is always the danger that the estimated deficit for 1943 of
                                    24 million pesos may attain a higher figure, such as 36 million
                                    pesos, if conditions caused by the war continue at the present
                                    rate. The Government, therefore, finds itself in a financial
                                    situation which is critical and which it hopes the United States
                                    will find itself in a position to alleviate.</p>
                                <p>The Government has endeavored to avoid inflation through an
                                    increase of 35 percent of income taxes and a compulsory
                                    provision that 50 percent of the amount of income tax payments
                                    shall be invested in economic defense bonds.</p>
                                <p>Just as the President took the position in 1939, when a director
                                    of the Electric Light Company, that war was inevitable (against
                                    the advice of the other directors who tried to persuade him to
                                    buy machinery from Switzerland), now he takes the position
                                    publicly that the war will end within the next six or twelve
                                    months. If he did not take that position publicly, an economic
                                    and financial disaster might be expected in Colombia, due to the
                                    increasing critical situation of the Government because of lack
                                    of importations and consequent decreased revenue. The people of
                                    Colombia are in no mood to appreciate the seriousness of the
                                    situation. Instead of pulling together, they are indulging in
                                    luxurious, individualistic thought without regard for the
                                    morrow. In this Administration the President wishes to
                                    accomplish two things: (1) improvement in agriculture, and (2)
                                    road building. In the latter respect he contemplates the
                                    following highways: Medellín–Turbo; Medellín–Cartagena;
                                    Bogotá–Rio Hacha; Cali–Buenaventura; as well as lesser highways
                                    in the Putomayo.</p>

                                    to the Banco de la República in 1940 still has five years to

                                    greatest help to the Colombian Government if the Export-Import
                                    Bank, at the request of the Department of State, would extend
                                    for a period of eight years as from now a credit of eight
                                    million dollars to the Government of Colombia, permitting the
                                    Banco de la República to transfer its balance to the credit of
                                    the Government. The Banco de la República can well afford to do
                                    this, having sufficient reserves, and the extension of this
                                    credit to the Government would enable the Government not only to
                                    proceed with the liquidation of some of its obligations but also
                                    to start constructive work on road-building.</p>

                            officials which the Colombian Government might wish to designate.</p>
                        <p>It seems probable that both Vice President Wallace and yourself may be

                            President López spoke to the Ambassador on the 31st of March saying that
                            he would be most appreciative if the Department would support the
                            $15,000,000 credit which is desired from the Bank, and mentioned that
                            for political reasons he is particularly anxious agricultural activities
                            progress. The President at the same time expressed his wish that the
                            obligation for the slightly over $8,000,000 balance of a loan made to
                            the Banco de la República by the Export-Import Bank should be
                            transferred to the Government and be allowed to run for eight years
                            instead of the five years which would otherwise remain as the period of
                            the loan. Mr. Lane reported on this subject by telegram and in strictly
                            confidential airgram no. 274 of April 3.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the transfer of the obligation from the Banco de la
                            República to the Government, this will undoubtedly have the approval of
                            the Export-Import Bank but it will need a definite clearance when Warren
                                Pierson<note n="53" xml:id="d73fn53">President of the Export-Import
                                Bank.</note> is back in town tomorrow. The idea of the $15,000,000
                            loan on the agricultural plans along the lines of Dr. Miguel López’s
                            project has, at best, received a lukewarm reaction from the
                            Export-Import Bank, and Ross Moore. While fully supporting the <pb
                                n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0088"/>desire to help in the most
                            effective way, they, along with some of us in the Department, are very
                            doubtful of the wisdom of some of the specific projects for which the
                            loan is requested. Dr. Moore considers that any agricultural development
                            must be closely related to the construction of roads and other
                            communications facilities and that this would particularly influence any
                            decision as to how wise it might be to make any general allotments for
                            softie of the short and long-term agricultural projects. The allotment,
                            too, of a million dollars for the parceling of properties has also not
                            been favorably looked upon. The Bank has said that if a loan is made it
                            is preferable simply to make a block allotment which could be used for
                            projects the Bank would approve and that the Bank would prefer not to
                            get into a Development Corporation.</p>
                        <p>All of those who have discussed this subject are in agreement that we
                            should give technical assistance to Colombia, although Dr. Moore has
                            pointed out that no large number of technicians would be readily found
                            in the United States for immediate service. However, he believes there
                            are some young men who have been trained here who might apply their
                            experience in Colombia and be of some service. It will, unquestionably,
                            be desirable to provide funds to cover essential equipment and other
                            material which must be imported from, the United States, but present war
                            conditions would make it unwise to give any definite commitment as to
                            quantity or time of delivery. I know that as you will be on the ground
                            and able to talk this over first-hand with Mr. Lane that you can
                            determine to best advantage what influence political considerations
                            should have in the extension of any part or all of the loan which is now
                            requested.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me quite likely that when you are discussing agricultural
                            matters, some reference will come up in connection with the draft of a
                            suggested agreement between the Secretary of Agriculture of the United
                            States and the Minister of National Economy of Colombia, which was the
                            outcome of the talks Dr. Moore had when he was in Colombia last
                            November. This primarily had to do with the establishment of an
                            agricultural experiment station in the Río León Valley. If this were
                            carried out, it would provide for a very modest expenditure by this
                            Government. I think that this may have been laid aside by the interested
                            officials in Colombia in view of the more elaborate agricultural plan
                            which Miguel López has subsequently proposed.</p>
                        <p>I expect that you will wish to point out the desirability of having the
                            entire matter studied in Washington after Dr. Miguel López or some other
                            designated person, or persons, come here for that purpose, as this will
                            permit a more thorough consideration of all angles of the <pb n="75"
                                xml:id="pg_75" facs="0089"/>problem than it is believed could be
                            given if negotiations were carried oil in Colombia.</p>
                        <p>When you return we shall look forward very much to having the advantage
                            of your opinion on this entire subject after the discussion which your
                            visit will have afforded.</p>

                        <p>498. Your A–274, April 3, 1 p.m. Both the Export-Import Bank and the
                            Department have given serious thought to and have discussed the point of
                            view expressed by President López and by you in your recent message
                            regarding financial assistance to Colombia. The Department and the Bank
                            have reached the following conclusions: <list>

                                <item>It is recognized that the conditions under which the
                                    $10,000,000 credit was extended to Banco de la República may no
                                    longer prevail. It is also appreciated that the Banco may not
                                    wish to continue servicing a credit for which it is presumed it
                                    has no immediate use.</item>

                                <item>Both the Bank and the Department are sympathetic with
                                    President López’ desire to promote further constructive activity
                                    in Colombia including the improvement of communications and the
                                    development of agriculture. The Export-Import Bank is willing to
                                    discuss further credits.</item>

                        <p>551. From Duggan. Reference Department’s cable 498, April 17, 6 p.m.
                            Please inform Miguel López that the Department and other interested
                            Government agencies will be glad to initiate discussions of the
                            Agricultural plan with him and his advisors in Washington on May 12 or
                            thereafter at his convenience. It has seemed impracticable to suggest an
                            earlier date since Boss Moore of Agriculture who has followed this
                            subject closely is now absent from Washington and will probably be
                            unable to return until several days later than the 12th.</p>
                        <p>In paragraph numbered 3 in the Department’s cable 498 of April 17
                            reference was made to the liquidation of the loan to the Banco de la
                            República to facilitate consideration of new loans for roads and
                            agricultural development in which the Colombian Government has now
                            expressed its interest. It will be helpful to the Department to know if
                            the President intends that Miguel López will negotiate regarding the
                            present Banco de la República obligation in addition to the agricultural
                            credit, since it is felt that such financial matters are necessarily
                            related.</p>
                        <p>It is requested that you inform President López of the information
                            contained in this present cable. [Duggan.]</p>

                            with Colombian officials which should not be considered necessarily as
                            representing official point of view of Colombian Government we have
                            obtained the impression that complications for the Colombian Government
                            may be created in the event that a credit of $15,000,000 required under
                            the agricultural plan should be considered jointly with the extension of
                            $8,000,000 credit by the Export-Import Bank to the Government of
                            Colombia (see airgram no. A–274, April 3).</p>
                        <p>It has been suggested that as $8,000,000 credit will be primarily for
                            public works projects and as the $15,000,000 credit will presumably be
                            administered by a corporation specifically set up for agricultural
                            purposes, considerable confusion might result if the two credits were
                            administered by the same entity.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing is submitted to the Department for consideration pending

                            and that Colombian Government has legal power to authorize Caja to
                            negotiate loan.</p>
                        <p>Miguel López said that Caja will gladly give us all necessary information
                            but that in Government’s opinion it is up to Export-Import Bank and not
                            up to Colombian Government to make the necessary arrangements with legal
                            counsel.</p>
                        <p>As explained to Keith the matter involved is only one of procedure but I
                            should appreciate being authorized to employ legal counsel for the

                        <p>1104. With reference your telegram No. 1520, August 28, the Export-Import
                            Bank states as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It is the Export-Import Bank’s practice in all credits to
                                    foreign governments or entities to require legal opinion of an
                                    attorney of the foreign country, selected and employed by such
                                    government or entity without cost to the Export-Import Bank. It
                                    will be recalled that such procedure was followed in the cases
                                    of the $10,000,000 credit to Banco de la República and the
                                    $12,000,000 credit to the Republic and it is provided for in the
                                    draft of contract submitted to Dr. Miguel López. The
                                    Export-Import Bank always accepts the opinion of any attorney
                                    who the American Embassy states is a member of the local bar in
                                    good standing.</p>
                                <p>The Export-Import Bank has not yet been informed definitively
                                    whether President López desires to use a new section of the Caja
                                    or a new corporation although Ambassador Lleras was advised that
                                    the Export-Import Bank was agreeable to either medium provided
                                    it received satisfactory proof of legality. If a new section of
                                    the Caja is to be used and if the latter is to be created by
                                    Executive Decree pursuant to existing law the Export-Import Bank
                                    should be furnished copies of the <hi rend="italic">Diario
                                        Oficial</hi> containing the pertinent existing legislation
                                    and a preliminary legal opinion to the effect that said existing
                                    legislation authorizes the issuance of one or more decrees
                                    providing for (1) the creation of a new autonomous section
                                    having its own board of directors in the Caja, (2) the
                                    contracting of a foreign obligation to the extent of $10,000,000
                                    by the Caja or by the new section in accordance with the general
                                    terms and conditions set forth in the draft of proposed contract
                                    which was delivered by the Export-Import Bank to Dr. Miguel
                                    López, and (3) the unconditional guarantee by the Republic of
                                    Colombia of the obligations to be issued by the Caja or by the
                                    new section thereof. It was suggested to Ambassador Lleras that
                                    the issuance of any such new decree or decrees be postponed
                                    until the Export-Import Bank has been supplied with the
                                    foregoing.</p>
                                <p>If the medium selected by President López is to be a new
                                    governmental corporation it is assumed that a special law
                                    creating this corporation will be drafted to meet the situation
                                    and accordingly it will be sufficient for the Export-Import
                                    Bank’s purposes that it be provided with a legal opinion only
                                    after the law has been passed and the contract signed.”</p>

                            me by the Archbishop Primate of Bogotá,<note n="67" xml:id="d83fn67"
                                >Ismael Perdomo.</note> expressing the deep concern felt, not only
                            by himself, but also by all the other Bishops of Colombia at the
                            possible results of the intensive propaganda now being carried on in
                            this country by Protestant missionaries. The Archbishop’s letter was
                            delivered to me by the Papal Nuncio<note n="68" xml:id="d83fn68"
                                >MonSeñor Serena.</note> who stated that he had himself been
                            requested by the Archbishop to address a protest to the Embassy, but had
                            declined to do so since he realized that it was my duty as Ambassador of
                            the United States to protect all legitimate activities of American
                            nationals in Colombia and that I could not be expected to interfere on
                            behalf of Colombian interests with such activities.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that the Archbishop recognizes that I have pointed out
                            to him that the activities of the missionaries are not directed nor
                            encouraged by the Government of the United States, but that he feels
                            nevertheless that the gravity and importance of the situation should <pb
                                n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0095"/>be brought to the attention of
                            the American Government in order that it may consider whether it might
                            not be desirable and advisable to take some action.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted also that the Archbishop warns that he and his fellow
                            Bishops, having considered the matter at the conference of Bishops
                            called together last week at El Ocaso, near Bogotá, consider it
                            essential to the fulfilment of their most sacred duties “to sound a note
                            of alarm in defense of the religious faith of the people, and to take
                            the necessary precautions to counteract the Protestant propaganda.” “The
                            fulfilment of this duty,” he adds, “may occasion, against their
                            intention and will, lamentable difficulties and disturbances of internal
                            public order much more disastrous now than in any other
                            circumstances.”</p>
                        <p>That the possibility of such disturbances is only too actual is evidenced
                            not only by the riot at Fontibón reported in my despatch under
                            reference, but by reports just received of a riot on May 23 at the
                            village of Duitama in the Province of Boyacá.<note n="*"
                                xml:id="d83fn68a">With regard to anti-Protestant sentiment in
                                Duitama, see the Embassy despatch no. 2074 transmitting
                                anti-missionary leaflet which, it is understood, has been handed out
                                at church by the local priests. [Footnote in the original; despatch
                                not printed.]</note> In the course of a religious procession around
                            the public square of this village, several members of the procession
                            finding themselves passing by the door of the local Protestant mission
                            took the occasion to throw stones at the building. They were immediately
                            imitated by others, and a general attack on the mission developed. Doors
                            were broken down and furniture and church property damaged. The head of
                            the mission, Olger Quanrud, an American citizen, reports that he was
                            struck by stones but not injured. According to press reports the local
                            police force was unable to quell the riot and order was restored only
                            after the arrival of forces from Paipa and Tunja, the capital of the
                            Province. In the course of the riot one police agent was wounded by a
                            gunshot and a second was stabbed. Various civilians received minor
                            injuries from stones. Following the arrival of the forces from Paipa and
                            Tunja some forty-two persons were arrested.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a report by an opposition newspaper on the disturbances in
                            Duitama.]</p>
                        <p>I have thought it advisable for the moment to acknowledge the
                            Archbishop’s letter in writing only briefly. (A copy of my reply is
                            enclosed with this despatch.<note n="69" xml:id="d83fn69">Not
                                printed.</note>) I have taken occasion, however, to call on the
                            Archbishop and to point out to him that I have an obligation to protect
                            the interests of all United States citizens in Colombia, regardless of
                            their religion or creed, and that when my fellow nationals are <pb
                                n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0096"/>carrying on activities in
                            accordance with the guarantees extended by the Constitution of Colombia
                            and not in violation of the laws of the country, my Government would
                            expect me to support their requests for protection from violence with
                            which they may have been threatened by individuals of other religious
                            faiths.</p>
                        <p>At the same time I recalled to the Archbishop that as I had on several
                            past occasions explained to him and to the Nuncio, I have warned my
                            fellow citizens who are carrying on missionary activities in Colombia to
                            comport themselves with the greatest tact and correctness and to respect
                            the religion and traditions of the country of which they are privileged
                            to enjoy the hospitality. Such a course of conduct, I stated, was in my
                            opinion obligatory on them not only as good Christians but as citizens
                            of a nation which desires to maintain the most friendly and close
                            relations with the sister Republic of Colombia.</p>
                        <p>The Archbishop received me cordially, but while he freely admitted the
                            existence of Constitutional guarantees and the entire legality of the
                            activities of the Protestant missionaries, he nevertheless persisted in
                            his view that these activities were disruptive of the religious life of
                            Colombia and should be restricted if possible. He seemed particularly to
                            resent the Protestant missionaries’ alleged practice of hiring ignorant
                            and simple “indígenos” to carry on the work of proselytizing among their
                            fellows.</p>
                        <p>[The remainder of this despatch is concerned with the attitude and views
                            of several parties more or less interested in the conflict.]</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the Department’s
                            confidential instruction no. 1518 of August 19, 1943, I have the honor
                            to report that according to information received by the American Consul
                            in Cali,<note n="73" xml:id="d85fn73">Howard A. Bowman.</note> the
                            Catholic priest of Silvia, Department of Cauca, recently delivered a
                            rabidly anti-American speech which, beginning with a vigorous
                            denunciation of American missionaries, developed into a general attack
                            on the United States and its policies.</p>
                        <p>The Vice Consul at Bucaramanga,<note n="74" xml:id="d85fn74">J. Brock
                                Havron.</note> Department of Norte de Santander, reports that the
                            Bucaramanga newspaper, <hi rend="italic">El Frente</hi>, has published a
                            series of articles during the past month attacking Protestant
                            missionaries and alleging that these missionaries are being sent to
                            South America in order to facilitate the absorption of the
                            Latin-American countries by the United States. The Vice Consul reports
                            that on August 14 a demonstration against Protestant missions was
                            organized in Pamplona by a Father Mendoza, assistant to the Bishop. The
                            Vice Consul also reports that on September 3 there took place at
                            Bucaramanga a noisy demonstration against the activities of the
                            Protestant missionaries on the part of local schoolboys who marched up
                            and down the center of the town shouting “Vivas” and “Abajos,” and
                            stoned several Protestant meeting places and the Masonic Temple. The two
                            Conservative newspapers of Bucaramanga, <hi rend="italic">El Deber</hi>
                            and <hi rend="italic">El Frente</hi>, are reported to have described the
                            demonstration on the following day as a righteous manifestation on the
                            part of the city’s youth, carried out in perfect order. According to the
                            newspapers the marchers were inspiringly addressed by Fathers Sorzano
                            and Jaimes. A similar description of the demonstration published in the
                            Bogotá newspaper, <hi rend="italic">El Siglo</hi>, on September 8th is
                                enclosed.<note n="75" xml:id="d85fn75">Not reprinted.</note></p>
                        <p>It appears that the immediate cause of the demonstration was an alleged
                            reference by Mr. Baxter,<note n="76" xml:id="d85fn76">William E. Baxter,
                                Seventh Day Adventist representative in Bogotá.</note> an American
                            missionary, to the Pope as the Beast of the Apocalypse. The City Council
                            of Bucaramanga passed a resolution praising the Pope and protesting
                            against the calumnies and disrespectful statements made against him by a
                            “certain foreign lecturer.” Following the demonstration, the ladies of
                            Bucaramanga, headed by the wife of the Governor of the Province,
                            addressed telegrams to the Papal Nuncio and the President of the <pb
                                n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0098"/>Republic protesting against the
                            propaganda of “aggressive Protestant sects which are imperilling
                            American cordiality”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Baxter denies having said anything against the Pope. In response to
                            an inquiry from the Vice Consul as to whether the matter should be taken
                            up with the Colombian authorities, the Embassy advised the Vice Consul
                            not to intervene with the Colombian authorities at this stage, but
                            suggested that if in the meantime he came into contact with Baxter he
                            should urge upon him the necessity for the greatest tact and discretion
                            in dealing with the Colombians. The Vice Consul reports that according
                            to information received from American missionaries there are now twenty
                            Protestant missionaries in the Department of Norte-de Santander. Of
                            these sixteen are American, two Canadian, and two Norwegian.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the Embassy’s despatch
                            no. 2730 of September 13, 1943, I have the honor to report that in the
                            course of a conversation on September 27 with President López, he told
                            me he had received a great number of telegrams in recent days protesting
                            against Protestant missionary activities in Colombia, so many, in fact,
                            that he had not yet been able to look through all of them. I told the
                            President that I had recently discussed the growing wave of
                            anti-Protestant demonstrations with Monsignor Brigard, Secretary General
                            and Vicario Apostolico of the Bogotá diocese, and that he had admitted
                            that agitation against missionaries had grown more serious of late but
                            was inclined to disclaim responsibility on the part of the Catholic
                            hierarchy and to claim that the agitation came primarily from political
                            sources. I told the President that I felt that the Catholic clergy in
                            Colombia should show more patience and understanding with regard to the
                            activities of Protestant missionaries, and should take into
                            consideration that although the United States had always been
                            predominantly Protestant, Catholic activities were in no way interfered
                            with there, and the number of Catholics had steadily increased until it
                            was estimated that nearly one-third of the population was now Catholic.
                            The President assented but made no suggestions as to any practical
                            measures which might be taken to improve the situation in Colombia. He
                            indicated, however, that his Government was determined <pb n="85"
                                xml:id="pg_85" facs="0099"/>to afford the missionaries all necessary
                            protection as long as they kept within the limits of Colombian law.</p>

                        <p>2012. Some days ago the Minister of Gobierno<note n="78" xml:id="d87fn78"
                                >Alberto Lleras Camargo.</note> expressed desire to discuss with me
                            unfavorable situation affecting Protestant missionaries in Colombia and
                            especially in Bucaramanga. As the Department is aware there have been
                            recent incidents in Bucaramanga and Manizales in which Catholic populace
                            has apparently been incited by clergy to take physical action against
                            missionaries.</p>
                        <p>Today I orally informed Lleras Camargo that I am concerned regarding
                            situation but that I fear there is nothing further I could do with
                            Archbishop Perdomo as I had been informed that due to differences within
                            the hierarchy itself he would probably not be able to take action on any
                            request from me. I said however that I intended to visit Bucaramanga
                            next week, this being the only Consulate in Colombia which I had not yet
                            visited and that I would take advantage of my trip to counsel calm, tact
                            and tolerance to the Protestant missionaries. I told Lleras that before
                            making the trip I wished to ascertain from him whether my visit might
                            not provoke further difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Lleras said that he would consult the Archbishop telling him of my offer
                            to attempt to calm the situation in Bucaramanga and said that he would
                            advise the Archbishop that there would be a corresponding obligation on
                            the part of the ecclesiastical authorities to give instructions to the
                            local priests to refrain from inciting their parishes against the
                            American missionaries.</p>
                        <p>Lleras observed that the greater part of the trouble is due to desire of
                            local politicians to embarrass the Government with the United States
                            Government and that in the past there had been no difficulties as a
                            result of American missionary activities in Colombia.</p>

                        <p>2039. Minister of Gobierno telephoned me this morning that he had
                            consulted Archbishop Perdomo who had agreed to instruct the
                            corresponding bishop regarding necessity of putting a stop to attacks on
                            American missionaries. Lleras’ intercession being kept strictly
                            confidential so as to avoid any possible political repercussions. It is
                            planned therefore that I shall proceed to Bucaramanga the end of next
                            week ostensibly to visit the Consulate and meet the American colony in
                            Bucaramanga but I shall take advantage of my stay to impress upon
                            American missionaries the necessity of their not antagonizing the local
                            population. The foregoing is in connection with my 2012<note n="79"

                        <p>A–944. Reference my telegram no. 2039, November 13, 11 a.m. As a matter
                            of courtesy, I called on the Apostolic Nuncio today to apprise him of
                            the reasons for my visit to Bucaramanga.</p>
                        <p>Monsignor Serena said that he was very glad to know that I was making the
                            trip, especially as he is under great pressure from what he termed the
                            rabid element in the Department of Santander, He said that this element
                            is insisting that he should make representations to the Colombian
                            Government against the activities of Protestant missionaries in that
                            Department on the ground that such Protestant activities violate Article
                            I of the Concordat promulgated by Pope Leo XIII on December 31, 1887.
                            The Nuncio referred me to this Article which provides that the Roman
                            Catholic religion is the religion of Colombia and that the Colombian
                            Government is obligated to protect and defend it. Monsignor Serena added
                            that this Article was not amended by the supplementary Concordat of 1942
                            and that it is part of the enacted legislation of Colombia as Law 35 of
                            1888.</p>
                        <p>The Nuncio said that he would not make representations to the Colombian
                            Government in this regard. He expressed agreement with my point of view
                            that as long as the American missionaries do not violate the laws of the
                            country the Colombian Government is obligated <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87"
                                facs="0101"/>to protect them from physical violence. He expressed
                            doubt as to the efficacy of any instructions sent by the Archbishop to
                            the clergy in Santander as he realizes from his own experience in the
                            case of the Concordat that the clergy in that Department have no respect
                            for authority.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that in
                            accordance with the intention outlined in my telegram no. 2039, November
                            13, 11 a.m. and my airgram no. 944, November 18, 2 p.m., I visited
                            Bucaramanga, the capital of the Department of Santander, on November 19
                            and 20. I have requested the Vice Consul in charge, Mr. J. Brock Havron,
                            to report on the activities which took place during my stay in
                            Bucaramanga and hence I shall confine myself to a discussion of the
                            religious situation which, I may add, I found to be even more serious
                            than I had originally suspected.</p>
                        <p>I found the Governor of the Department, Dr. Arturo Santos, a distant
                            relation of ex-President Eduardo Santos, to be an understanding,
                            tolerant and intelligent official. As will be described below, he
                            attributes the attacks on the Protestant missionaries to be chiefly due
                            to the desire on the part of Conservative politicians to stir up trouble
                            between the Governments of Colombia and the United States. As will be
                            noted from my conversations with the Governor, there is likewise a
                            bitter personal feeling between him and the Bishop of Pamplona, the
                            ecclesiastical official in authority in the diocese in which Bucaramanga
                            lies. This hostility dates back to the Governor’s youth when he was a
                            student in the school of which the Bishop was then the principal. Both
                            President López and President Echandίa<note n="80" xml:id="d90fn80"
                                >Dario Echandίa was Acting President while President López was in
                                the United States from November 19, 1943, to May 16, 1944.</note>
                            informed me on November 22 that they consider the local political
                            situation to be the principal cause for the friction existing.</p>
                        <p>With a view to creating better feeling on the part of the Roman Catholic
                            hierarchy in Bucaramanga, I called on the vicar of the parish in
                            Bucaramanga immediately following my call on the Governor. I informed
                            the press of my calls on the Governor and the vicar, stating that I
                            called on the Governor as the head of the local government of
                            Bucaramanga and that I called on the vicar as the representative of the
                            religion of Colombia. I found the vicar to be a reasonable,
                            wellintentioned <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0102"/>priest who showed
                            no bitterness towards the missionaries. I describe hereunder his remarks
                            which indicate that his attitude should not be considered as being
                            responsible for the existing friction. As will be noted from my
                            conversation with the Governor, those chiefly responsible for existing
                            trouble are the Bishop of Pamplona, Padre Mejía Moncayo, S. J., the
                            principal of the school of San Pedro Claver, and the Franciscan priests
                            who, according to the Governor, are controlled by the Spanish
                            Falange.</p>
                        <p>I held an extended conversation with the missionaries themselves on
                            November 20 pointing out that as American citizens they have an
                            obligation to their Government to create no difficulties in our
                            relations with Colombia. I made it clear as I did to the Governor and to
                            the vicar of Bucaramanga that I have two principal duties in Colombia:
                            (1) the maintenance and development of friendly relations with the
                            Government and people of Colombia, and (2) the protection of American
                            citizens and interests in Colombia, regardless of creed. I pointed out
                            that when these two duties conflict I am confronted with a very delicate
                            situation, and for this reason it is my hope that neither the Colombian
                            ecclesiastical authorities nor the American citizens involved should
                            create for the Embassy a situation which might seriously affect the
                            friendly relations which now exist between the United States and
                            Colombia. Unfortunately, some missionaries, unauthorized by their
                            superiors or by the missionary group as a whole, have committed acts
                            which in my opinion have been in inexcusably bad taste and have
                            naturally resulted in bitter irritation on the part of the Roman
                            Catholic Church authorities. For instance, a pamphlet has been
                            circulated entitled “Supuesta Visita de San Pablo a Bogotá” which is a
                            sarcastic attack on Catholicism. This pamphlet, a copy of which is
                            enclosed, was sent by the Bishop of Pamplona to the Governor of
                            Santander and was handed to me by the Governor for my information. The
                            attack on the morals of the Roman Catholic clergy on pages 10 and 11 is
                            especially to be deplored. I informed the missionaries that such an
                            attack would undoubtedly not be permitted in the United States on the
                            ground of the indecent nature of the charges, and in my opinion there
                            could be no justification for the publication. The missionaries
                            requested me to inform whomever might be interested that they deplore
                            this publication, and in fact Dr. Allen,<note n="81" xml:id="d90fn81">R.
                                M. Allen.</note> the head of the Presbyterian Mission Board in
                            Bucaramanga, said that he would ask Dr. Seel in Bogotá to take steps to
                            destroy all outstanding copies of the pamphlet.</p>
                        <p>I made an investigation regarding the report that Mr. William E. Baxter
                            of the Seventh Day Adventists had rifles in his possession. Mr. Baxter
                            said that the report in question was untrue but that there <pb n="89"
                                xml:id="pg_89" facs="0103"/>was justification for the report in that
                            one of the Colombian members of his mission, after having been attacked
                            by a Catholic group, had been given two 22-caliber rifles by a Colombian
                            citizen for his protection. Mr. Baxter admitted that he, Baxter, had
                            purchased ammunition for these rifles but that the rifles themselves had
                            never been in Mr. Baxter’s home. He said that as soon as the trouble had
                            died down the rifles had been removed from the home of his Colombian
                            collaborator and that they would not be returned to his house. I pointed
                            out to him the very serious trouble which might arise should it ever be
                            charged that the missionaries were armed and I said to the group as a
                            whole that the activities of all of them might be terminated if any
                            indiscretion, such as the carrying of arms, should become publicly
                            known.</p>
                        <p>The vicar of the parish of Bucaramanga, the Reverend Jesús Jaimes, said
                            to me that he fully appreciated my position as being obligated to
                            protect all American interests and citizens in Colombia regardless of
                            creed. He likewise admitted that the American Protestant missionaries
                            are guaranteed under the Colombian Constitution freedom of worship,
                            according to their conscience, and liberty to practise their profession,
                            provided that they do so within the law of Colombia. I deplored to the
                            vicar the attacks which unauthorized persons had made against the Roman
                            Catholic Church in Colombia and I expressed the opinion that there are
                            bound to be undisciplined Protestant missionaries who, because of
                            overzealousness, act outside of the instructions issued by their
                            principals in the United States, just as there are unauthorized acts
                            committed by members of the Roman Catholic hierarchy in Colombia, which
                            undoubtedly would not be approved by their superiors in Bogotá. I said
                            that I especially had in mind action on the part of Catholic priests in
                            Colombia in inciting their parishioners to take physical action against
                            American citizens. I emphasized that as American Ambassador I could not
                            tolerate my co-nationals being subjected to injury because of lawless
                            attacks on their persons and that if such attacks persisted I should
                            naturally be compelled to request adequate protection from the Colombian
                            Government. Father Jaimes indicated that he fully appreciated my
                            position and said that he too deplored physical attacks against human
                            beings no matter what their nationality or religion, and added that such
                            action is un-Christian and as such could not be condoned by the
                            Church.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a summary of conversations with Governor Santos regarding
                            certain individuals said to have been responsible for the intensity of

                        <p>Ex-President Santos informs me that in his opinion chief reason for
                            hostility on the part of Roman Catholic ecclesiastical authorities
                            towards American Protestant missionaries in Colombia is economic. He
                            said that except in certain districts, such as some sectors of Bogotá
                            and Medellín, the Church in Colombia is surprisingly poor and that many
                            of the priests have hardly sufficient funds with which to live. He said
                            that a parish priest in the outlying districts of Colombia generally is
                            paid for funeral, marriage and baptismal services in small quantities of
                            foodstuffs barely sufficient to sustain him. Actions of American
                            missionaries having come to Colombia with private bank accounts and
                            liberal allowances for living expenses has created bitter animosity on
                            the part of the Catholic clergy.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of the lack of tact of certain of the American missionaries
                            Santos [said] “fanatics never have tact whether they be Catholics,
                            Protestants, or Mussulmen”.</p>

                        <p>206. Your telegram 208, March 10. You should make perfectly clear to
                            appropriate government officials that the pooling arrangement under
                            which the American republics are receiving imported oil supplies is
                            fundamentally and essentially a joint agreement under which all oil
                            supplies and supplying facilities are added together and divided on a
                            basis of equality among the participants. According to this definition
                            there can be no such thing as “oil imports outside the pool.” Department
                            is strongly in favor of full development of all possibilities of
                            increasing oil supplies from all available sources including Mexico but
                            principle stated above will be followed in all cases.</p>

                        <p>The Costa Rican Ambassador here inquired yesterday concerning the bearing
                            of Costa Rican imports of Mexican gasoline on the petroleum supply pool.
                            The statement given the Ambassador was essentially the same as that
                            which you were instructed, in the telegram under reference, to give to
                            the Costa Rican authorities. We endeavored to make it perfectly clear to
                            the Ambassador that, while we favored the development of all sources of
                            supplies, if Costa Rica imports gasoline from Mexico tanker borne
                            supplies furnished by the pool will be reduced in an equivalent amount.
                            We explained to the Ambassador that the pool principles, including this
                            one, are applied uniformly in the case of all participating countries.
                            The Ambassador indicated his understanding and stated that he would
                            inform his Government accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the contents of your despatch under reference, which were not
                            discussed specifically with Ambassador Escalante, the assignment, as
                            requested by the President of Costa Rica, of the gasoline already
                            imported from Mexico to the Costa Rican Government as an extra
                            allowance, would not solve the question in accordance with the
                            above-mentioned principle unless it is understood that an equivalent
                            amount will not be delivered by pool tankers and the Costa Rican pool

                        <p>A–474. Legation’s A–625, May 8 and Department’s A–461, May 11. With
                            reference to Madrigal’s statement that the United States would not
                            prevent Costa Rica “from exercising its right to relieve the quota
                            gasoline shortage by obtaining additional supplies which in no way
                            affect pool operations”, you should make it perfectly clear to the Costa
                            Rican authorities that the pooling arrangement is not for the purpose of
                            restricting supplies but is designed to make equitable distribution on
                            the basis of restricted tanker facilities. Consequently, on the one hand
                            the development by a country of additional sources of supply is favored.
                            On the other hand, equitable distribution must be maintained and there
                            must be no discrimination as between participating countries in the
                            application of pool principles. This fact, in conjunction with the
                            restricted tanker situation, makes it imperative that tanker borne
                            supplies to Costa Rica be reduced in an amount equivalent to any imports
                            from Mexico and the badly needed tanker space saved thereby utilized
                            elsewhere. This same course would be followed in the case of any other
                            country in like circumstances.</p>
                        <p>The Department will maintain its position in this matter.<note n="9"

                            be derived. Prior to the present war, over 95 percent of the world’s
                            quinine came from the Netherlands East Indies where cinchona trees were
                            scientifically cultivated. Trees known as “Cinchona ledgeriana” were
                            developed there which produced a very high quinine content. <pb n="95"
                                xml:id="pg_95" facs="0109"/>The more common “Cinchona succirubra” of
                            South America produces bark with a much lower quinine content. At
                            present the sole source of quinine for the United States is the bark of
                            wild cinchona trees of a few Latin American countries, and it is
                            essential to the war effort that new sources of quinine be
                            developed.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Fischer<note n="12" xml:id="d97fn12">Col. Arthur F.
                                Fischer.</note> of the United States Army, who has had more than
                            twenty years experience with cinchona plantations in the Philippines and
                            the East Indies, escaped from Bataan with over 2,000,000 cinchona seeds
                            of the ledgeriana variety. These seeds are now being cared for by the
                            United States Department of Agriculture.</p>
                        <p>Defense Supplies Corporation plans to establish in Latin America a
                            plantation upon which the seeds brought by Colonel Fischer from the
                            Philippines may be grown and various experiments conducted with
                            reference to cinchona. It is planned that Colonel Fischer will be placed
                            in charge of the plantation and will have a number of technical experts
                            to assist him.</p>
                        <p>Defense Supplies Corporation would like to establish and operate such a
                            plantation in Costa Rica. In order to assure room for expansion and
                            development of the project it will require 10,000 acres of land,
                            preferably cleared or semi-cleared.</p>
                        <p>The enclosed Memorandum of Understanding should be submitted to the Costa
                            Rican Government as soon as possible. You will note that the Costa Rican
                            Government is asked to make the necessary lands available to Defense
                            Supplies Corporation by lease, concession or otherwise for a period of
                            twenty-five years. Naturally we would much prefer that the Republic of
                            Costa Rica would, as its contribution to this project, grant a
                            concession of government lands without charge to Defense Supplies
                            Corporation. If this is not possible, Defense Supplies Corporation would
                            be willing to lease or purchase the necessary lands. The program
                            contemplates the surrender of the plantation and the buildings thereon
                            within twenty-five years to the Republic of Costa Rica, and a concession
                            to Government-owned lands would therefore seem most appropriate.</p>
                        <p>The interest of Supplies Corporation is primarily to assure the United
                            Nations a reserve supply of quinine in the event the present war is a
                            prolonged one. Consequently the measure should be presented to the Costa
                            Rican Government as a mutual war project. Of secondary importance is the
                            fact that the proposed plantation will probably become the nucleus of a
                            permanent cinchona bark industry in the Western Hemisphere. In this
                            connection it should be observed that Defense Supplies Corporation will
                            make available to the Republic of Costa Rica technical and scientific
                            information acquired by it in the operation of the plantation.</p>
                        <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0110"/>
                        <p>The project will be conducted so as to comply in all respects with the
                            applicable laws of Costa Rica. Costa Rica is asked only to make
                            necessary lands available, not to impose taxes, fees, charges, etc.,
                            which would hinder the full development of the plantation, and not to
                            restrict the exportation of seeds, stems, roots, or bark of cinchona
                            trees to friendly nations for a twenty-five year period. If any question
                            is raised concerning this latter provision, you may state that its
                            intention is only to assure access to a source of cinchona ledgeriana
                            seed by the United States and other nations, particularly those of the
                            Western Hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>It is necessary for the preservation of the seeds that they be
                            transplanted as quickly as possible. If the enclosed Memorandum is
                            approved in the near future, the Board of Economic Warfare will
                            immediately send representatives to Costa Rica to search for suitable
                            lands and it is expected that the project could be put under way within
                            a few months. Inasmuch as the Board of Economic Warfare and Defense
                            Supplies Corporation would like to proceed with the project as rapidly
                            as possible, you should ascertain and advise us whether any objection
                            might be had to sending a survey party to Costa Rica prior to execution
                            of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. R. V. Dewey, special representative of the Board of Economic Warfare
                            and Defense Supplies Corporation, is informed of the proposal and should
                            be able to give you valuable assistance in the presentation of this
                            Memorandum and should be asked to participate with you in discussions
                            concerning it.</p>

                        <p>A–411. Referring to my telegram No. 99, February 8, 12 noon, the
                                Minister<note n="18" xml:id="d99fn18">Minister of
                                Agriculture.</note> points out that in article 2 the statement
                            “shall be free to dispose of its personal property, machinery and
                            equipment” if interpreted literally might mean that at the end of 25
                            years the Costa Rican Government would not receive the plantation in
                            running order. He hopes that a change can be made to ensure that Costa
                            Rica will receive the machinery and equipment at the end of 25 years. He
                            requests a definition of “personal property”.</p>
                        <p>At the end of article 5 the Minister would appreciate the addition of
                            something along the following lines: “Costa Rica reserves the right,
                            however, to withhold from exportation sufficient quantities of
                            anti-malarial products to supply its normal domestic consumption”.</p>

                            and Mr. Dewey are authorized to make the following amendments in the
                            Memorandum of Understanding concerning the cinchona plantation to be
                            established in Costa Rica:</p>
                        <p>Insert at the end of the penultimate sentence in paragraph 2 the
                            following: “provided, however, that Defense Supplies Corporation shall
                            leave upon the plantation at the time of its surrender pursuant to
                            paragraph 1 hereof, so much of the equipment, machinery and tools then
                            on such plantation as shall be necessary for the reasonable and proper
                            operation of such plantation.”</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as Defense Supplies Corporation is at liberty to surrender the
                            lands granted it at any time within 25 years, it cannot guarantee to
                            place the plantation in running order prior to such surrender. However,
                            the above amendment makes it clear that necessary equipment on the
                            plantation at the time of surrender will not be removed so as to prevent
                            its continued reasonable operation.</p>
                        <p>Article 5 may be amended as follows: “Costa Rica reserves the right,
                            however, to withhold from exportation sufficient quantities of
                            antimalarial <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0114"/>products to supply
                            its normal antimalarial requirements, which are presently estimated at .
                            . . . . ounces of quinine sulphate, USP<note n="20" xml:id="d100fn20"
                                >United States Pharmacopoeia.</note> XI, or its equivalent per
                            annum.”</p>
                        <p>It is highly desirable that Defense Supplies Corporation should be
                            privileged to import necessary tools and equipment for use on the
                            plantation free of various import duties, taxes, etc. If you and Mr.
                            Dewey believe that this can be most satisfactorily done through an
                            exchange of notes, such notes should be exchanged. Otherwise it is felt
                            here that the following amendment should be inserted as paragraph 7 of
                            the Memorandum: “Defense Supplies Corporation shall be privileged to
                            import into Costa Rica any and all equipment, machinery, tools,
                            materials, or other property for direct use in connection with the

                            importation.”</p>

                            however, has told the Spanish Minister that upon proper application,
                            monthly withdrawals of small amounts, not exceeding 250 or 300 colones
                                <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi>, will probably be authorized for the

                            are completely without other means of subsistence. This, of course, is
                            not strictly in keeping with the provisions of Resolution I of the
                            Inter-American Conference on Systems of Economic and Financial

                            brought to the attention of the Minister of Finance,<note n="26"
                                xml:id="d102fn26">Carlos M. Escalante.</note> who has explained that
                            failure to permit such payments will impose upon the Costa Rican
                            government the burden of providing the indigent Italians with
                            subsistence funds, since it has been indicated by the Spanish Minister
                            that his government would not provide the funds from other sources. The
                            Minister of Finance has stated, however, that such payments will be kept
                            to a bare minimum, and that each case will be decided on its merits. In
                            view of the Costa Rican government’s previous reluctance to block these
                            funds, since they were held in the name of the Spanish Minister and
                            there was no documentary proof of their Italian ownership, the present
                            procedure can be regarded as substantially satisfactory from our
                            viewpoint, in spite of the divergence from the procedure recommended in
                            the Washington Conference. It is believed, further, that now that the
                            ice has been broken in this regard, it may be easier in the future to
                            secure a more strict adherence to the recommended procedure. In this
                            connection, it may be noted that the Costa Rican government has no funds
                            in Italy, so that it would be impossible to secure reciprocal treatment
                            for the payment of subsistence expenses of Costa Rican citizens
                            there.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the procedure outlined in the Department’s airgram
                            A–122 of October 8, 1942, it is now desired to know whether the dollar
                            funds in question may be remitted to the United States by the Banco
                            Nacional and credited to its account there. In this regard, it should be
                            borne in mind that one of the strongest arguments that <pb n="102"
                                xml:id="pg_102" facs="0116"/>was made to the Costa Rican government
                            authorities to induce them to block these funds was that the dollars
                            would not be accepted in the United States unless the equivalent in
                            colones were blocked here. An early reply is requested.</p>

                        <p>A–527. Reference Department’s circular telegram March 11, 8 p.m.<note
                                n="27" xml:id="d103fn27">Not printed.</note> The Junta de Custodia
                            has under its control about 10,000 quintals of coffee produced on
                            Proclaimed List properties. This coffee is “frozen” under an arrangement
                            whereby only 15% of Proclaimed List coffee is permitted to be sold in
                            the local market.</p>
                        <p>The Junta has now asked the Legation whether the importation of such
                            coffee into the United States will be permitted in the event it is
                            expropriated. The Legation’s reaction to this proposal was extremely
                            cool and it was pointed out to the Junta that as long as the coffee
                            producing properties remained in the hands of the Proclaimed List
                            nationals, the expropriation of the coffee for export to the United
                            States would, in effect, be the same as if the <hi rend="italic"
                                >finca</hi> owner were exporting the coffee directly to the United
                            States. The Junta then asked what would be the position of our
                            Government with respect to the importation of this coffee if the
                            properties on which it was produced were also expropriated. The Legation
                            feels justified in informing the Junta that coffee produced by
                            Proclaimed List farms <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the expropriation of
                            the farm and the elimination of the undesirable owner’s interest can be
                            exported freely to the United States, subject only to such restrictions
                            (such as quota, etc.) as are applicable to all coffee importations into
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>As to coffee produced by Proclaimed List farms <hi rend="italic"
                                >prior</hi> to their expropriation (such as the 10,000 quintals now
                            frozen by the Junta) the Department’s views are requested in order that
                            the Junta may be advised accordingly. Actually, more than half of the
                            coffee now “frozen” comes from properties which have been expropriated
                            (Niehaus and Hubbe Hijos).</p>
                        <p>It is believed in the Legation that our Government would be justified in
                            announcing to the local authorities that importation of coffee from
                            expropriated Proclaimed List properties will be permitted (assuming, of
                            course, that the interests of the undesirable owner in the <pb n="103"
                                xml:id="pg_103" facs="0117"/>property have been eliminated)
                            regardless of whether the coffee was produced before or after the
                            expropriation. This would have the double effect of encouraging the
                            local expropriation program and of counteracting, to a certain extent,
                            the frequently repeated complaint that our Government has discriminated
                            against Costa Rica and in favor of Guatemala by permitting importation
                            of Proclaimed List coffee from the latter.</p>
                        <p>No need is seen, however, to license importation of Proclaimed List
                            coffee from Costa Rica, or even to permit importation of expropriated
                            coffee in cases where the producing Proclaimed List farm has not also
                            been expropriated.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s early instructions are requested.</p>

                        <p>A–387. Your A–507, March 13. Treasury is prepared to release the
                            $141,895.25 in dollar currency held by the Spanish Minister on behalf of
                            the Italian Government for credit to the account of the Banco Nacional
                            under the conditions outlined in your airgram.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the proposed monthly withdrawals by the Spanish
                            Minister, which as you pointed out is not in keeping with the provisions
                            of Resolution I of the Washington Conference, you will undoubtedly
                            realize that the mere fact that the Spanish Government would not provide
                            funds for indigent Italian subjects in Costa Rica is not determinative
                            of the point at issue. Under Resolution I the obligation to take care of
                            such subjects could also be satisfied by the sending in of fresh funds
                            by the Italian Government through the Spanish. We realize, however, that
                            it may be impossible for the Costa Rican Government to insist upon such
                            a procedure and we agree with you that it would be inadvisable to
                            jeopardize the blocking of the $141,895.25 in an endeavor to prevent a
                            withdrawal of only 250 or 300 colones per month.</p>

                        <p>Following transmission of the Legation’s A–507, March 13, and receipt of
                            the Department’s above airgram, when the matter appeared to have been
                            fully settled, the negotiations broke down through the refusal of the
                            Spanish Minister to permit the funds to be subjected to the control of
                            the Junta de Custodia and through his insistence that the 250 or 300
                            colones per month originally suggested as permissible withdrawals were
                            insufficient to meet the subsistence needs of the indigent Italian
                            subjects in Costa Rica under his care.</p>

                        <p>While this Embassy has maintained the position that the Spanish
                            Minister’s views should not be permitted to affect or restrict the Costa
                            Rican Government’s sovereign right to deal with enemy property within
                            its territory, the Costa Rican Government, many of whose officials
                            maintain cordial and friendly personal relations with the Spanish
                            Minister, has tended to accede to his wishes in the matter for the

                                    the funds are either his own, or the property of the Spanish
                                    Government. This circumstance has been used by the Spanish
                                    Minister in order to bolster his bargaining position.</item>

                                    would be interpreted as an unfriendly act toward him and his

                        <p>Representatives of this Embassy, in frequent discussions on the subject

                            Washington Conference and to the many reasons which require that prompt
                            and effective action be taken with respect to these funds.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish Minister, after consultation with the Costa Rican Government,
                            has now proposed the following arrangement:</p>
                        <p>The dollars will be transferred to the Banco Nacional (which is the State
                            bank) and there converted into colones. The Spanish Minister will then
                            sign an undertaking whereby he commits himself not to draw on these
                            funds in excess of $200 (or its equivalent in colones) per month, for
                            subsistence payments to indigent Italians here. The details of such
                            withdrawals would be submitted to the Junta de Custodia, or to any
                            agency designated by the Government, for information and approval.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Finance has now requested this Embassy to inquire whether
                            the Treasury Department will accept the dollars in the United States for
                            credit to the Banco Nacional under the above arrangement.</p>

                            April 3, the Costa Rican Government proceeded to expropriate about 8,000
                            quintals of “frozen” coffee which had been produced or processed on
                            enemy properties. Unfortunately, some of this coffee was produced on
                            properties of Proclaimed List nationals which have not yet been
                            expropriated, and it was necessary for this Embassy to bring again to
                            the attention of the Junta de Custodia that the exportation of such
                            coffee to the United States would not be permitted, inasmuch as the
                            ownership of the producing property was the governing criterion. The
                            Junta has agreed that coffee from properties of Proclaimed List
                            nationals which have not been, and will not soon be, expropriated, will
                            not be allowed to be exported. A major proportion of the coffee which
                            has been expropriated, however, was produced on properties of Gmo.

                            has adopted in regard to the funds held by him on behalf of the Italian
                            Government is without adequate basis in fact, and has been assumed <pb
                                n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0122"/>for bargaining purposes. It
                            would further appear that the concession to the Spanish Minister to
                            which this Government previously agreed, (Department’s A–387, March 27,
                            1943) notwithstanding the objections [<hi rend="italic"
                                >obligations?</hi>] of Costa Rica under the Washington Conference,
                            is being used by him as an opening to develop further concessions which
                            would obviously be contrary to the best interests of both Costa Rica and
                            the United States. It is therefore regrettable that the Costa Rican
                            Government has up to the present exhibited a tendency to accede to the
                            wishes of the Spanish Minister in this matter. Therefore on the basis of
                            the facts presented, this Government is inclined to refuse to release in
                            this country the currency held in the name of the Spanish Minister
                            unless in the opinion of the Embassy such refusal would mean the loss of
                            adequate control of these funds. These funds it is noted are dollar
                            funds and you may inform the local authorities that this Government
                            takes the position that these are Axis funds and accordingly will take
                            appropriate action to prevent their encashment. It is believed that this
                            position may enable the Costa Rican Government to indicate to the
                            Spanish Minister that the United States Government has not agreed to
                            release these funds and therefore the Costa Rican Government is unable
                            to extend him credit for the dollars which he deposited.</p>
                        <p>In discussing this matter with the Costa Rican authorities you may care
                            to point out that the records of the Department do not appear to
                            indicate that the Spanish Minister has ever denied, that the funds in
                            question are the property of the Italian Government, and that this is in
                            fact the case is well known to all concerned. If the Spanish Minister
                            desires to avoid any possibility of being stigmatized as an enemy of
                            Costa Rica by having these funds held in the custody of the Junta, he
                            should cause the name of the account under which the Italian funds are
                            held to show the true ownership of the funds, You may care to stress to
                            the local authorities the artificial position assumed by the Spanish
                            Minister with reference to the funds of a government with which Costa
                            Rica is at war. You may also care to point out to the Costa Rican
                            authorities that the request of the Spanish Minister to make withdrawals
                            from these Axis funds is contrary to Resolution I of the Washington
                            Conference to which both Costa Rica and the United States subscribed. If
                            the Costa Rican Government insists that the funds must be treated as the
                            funds of the Spanish Minister, it might be well to inquire why the
                            Spanish Minister desires to use his personal funds to make payments to
                            enemy aliens in Costa Rica. It does not appear from the Department’s
                            records that these points have been brought out in discussions. In
                            conveying to the appropriate Costa Rican authorities these suggested
                            replies with particular reference to point <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109"
                                facs="0123"/>two of your airgram no. 678, you should be careful to
                            avoid any appearance of going beyond a friendly and informal indication
                            of the possible manner in which the Spanish Minister’s arguments might
                            be answered if the Costa Rican authorities should deem the suggestions
                            appropriate.</p>
                        <p>It appears that it might be desirable for this Government to defer making
                            a decision on the proposition recently advanced by the Spanish Minister

                            Costa Rican Government may be more inclined to take positive action
                            against these funds.</p>

                        <p>A–776. Reference the Department’s A–518, June 24. Following, receipt of
                            the above airgram, a conference was held with Minister Tinoco at which
                            he was informed in substance that our Government regarded the funds as
                            Axis funds, that it was not inclined to accept the dollars for release
                            in the United States unless the equivalent in colones should be
                            effectively blocked here, and that it was not disposed to make any
                            further concessions to the Spanish Minister.</p>
                        <p>While the Spanish Minister has never denied the true ownership of the
                            funds, he has been careful to avoid express recognition of that fact. He
                            has implicitly admitted their Italian Government ownership, however, by
                            entering into negotiations with the Costa Rican Government for the
                            blocking of the funds and requesting permission to make payments to
                            Italian subjects. This argument has been pointed out to the Minister of
                            Finance, whose attention has also repeatedly been called to the
                            provisions of Resolution I of the Washington Conference (see my airgram
                            A–678, June 1, 1943) and to Articles 5 and 11 of the Costa Rican Law No.
                            126 [<hi rend="italic">26</hi>] of December 12, 1942, which provide,
                            respectively, that subsistence payments to enemy nationals are not to be
                            made out of funds within the country and that funds of enemy governments
                            are to be “frozen” by the Junta de Custodia.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy wishes to make the following observations with respect to the
                            points raised in the Department’s airgram above-mentioned: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>While the Junta de Custodia is undoubtedly the agency best
                                    qualified to exercise supervision over the funds, it is not
                                    believed necessary to insist that the funds be brought under
                                    Junta control, provided effective blocking can be otherwise
                                    secured. To press for control by the Junta might unnecessarily
                                    delay and hamper negotiations, since the Spanish Minister is
                                    reluctant to follow this course and the Costa Rican Government
                                    appears disposed to accede to his wishes in this respect.
                                    Although the point has not been made, it is believed that the
                                    real reason for the Spanish Minister’s objections to the Junta
                                    is his fear that the provisions of local law which call for
                                    investment of “frozen” funds in Costa Rican Defense Bonds would
                                    be applied to the funds in question if they should come under
                                    Junta control. As an appropriate alternative, the funds could be
                                        (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) blocked under the direct control
                                    of the Minister of Finance; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) blocked
                                    under the control of the Superintendent of Banks, or (<hi
                                        rend="italic">c</hi>) blocked by written voluntary agreement
                                    between the bank and the Spanish Minister.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>It is unlikely that the Spanish Minister could be induced to
                                    permit the funds to be subjected to the direct control of the
                                    Junta even if payments of $200 per month should be authorized
                                    for the reasons above stated. While this Embassy has asked for a
                                    list of the indigent <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0125"
                                    />Italian subjects to whom payments would be made, such a list
                                    has not yet been presented. It is not believed that there are
                                    enough persons in this category to justify the expenditure of
                                    that amount, and in any event, this Embassy does not believe it
                                    advisable to accede to the Spanish Minister’s wishes in this
                                    respect, since such expenditures are in derogation of
                                    Inter-American commitments at the Washington Conference. As a
                                    maximum concession, it is believed that payments no greater than
                                    300 colones per month in toto could be authorized, in view of
                                    the insignificant proportion this would bear to the total
                                    amount, but even this concession should be made only if the

                                <item>It is not known when the Spanish Minister will depart from
                                    Costa Rica. He has announced that he has been tentatively
                                    assigned to Valparaiso, Chile, to occupy the post of Consul
                                    General, and that he is to be succeeded by the present Spanish
                                    Minister in Venezuela, but he has not yet received definite
                                    orders from his Government. The information contained in my

                                    based on a statement made by Minister Tinoco to the effect that
                                    the Spanish Minister’s departure was imminent. Whether or not
                                    the Costa Rican Government would be more inclined to take
                                    effective action against the funds after such an event is a moot
                                    question, but the man who has been mentioned as the Spanish
                                    Minister’s successor is known to be an ardent Falangista and
                                    might prove more difficult than the incumbent.</item>

                                <item>It is being very clearly pointed out to the Costa Rican
                                    Government and to the Spanish Minister that the dollars are
                                    likely to be worthless to the latter unless the procedure
                                    already accepted by the U. S. Government is followed. (<hi

                                    the departure of the Spanish Minister is not believed advisable
                                    since the date of such departure is uncertain and considerable
                                    delay may intervene.</item>

                                <item>While the circulation of dollar currency is prohibited in
                                    Costa Rica, the Banco de Costa Rica has indicated that said
                                    provision is interpreted in the sense of the use of dollar
                                    currency; for the payment of goods or services, and that the
                                    Banco de Costa Rica would still be bound, if the Spanish
                                    Minister should attempt to withdraw the funds from the bank, to
                                    make payment. On the other hand, he is not likely to attempt to
                                    take such funds out of Costa Rica, firstly, because he knows
                                    that the funds are “marked” and could easily be traced;
                                    secondly, because he has informally promised the Costa Rican
                                    Government that he would not do so, and he would be considered
                                    morally bound; and thirdly, because this Embassy would feel
                                    justified in making strong representations to the Costa Rican
                                    Government in such an event.</item>

                        <p>While the Spanish Minister has orally indicated to Minister Tinoco that
                            he would agree to the blocking of the funds under some agency of the
                            Costa Rican Government (not the Junta de Custodia) provided he is
                            permitted to withdraw up to 300 colones per month for payments to
                            indigent Italians, he is now refusing to commit himself definitely on
                            the matter until he obtains an answer from the Costa Rican Government to
                            his note requesting that Spanish nationals in Costa Rica be exempted
                            from financial and economic controls (see my despatch No. 361 of August
                            6, 1943<note n="36" xml:id="d111fn36">Not printed.</note>). He has
                            inferred that his position with respect to the Italian Government funds
                            will be affected, if not governed, by the Costa Rican Government’s reply
                            to the note in question.</p>
                        <p>Señor Tinoco has tendered his resignation as Minister of Finance and is
                            handling the business of that office only pending the appointment of a
                            new Minister, which is expected shortly.</p>
                        <p>All of the foregoing circumstances make it urgent, in the Embassy’s
                            opinion, that the Costa Rican Government be informed that unless the
                            funds are properly frozen and the dollars remitted to the United States
                            by a certain date, say September 15th, they will be treated as Axis
                            funds and their encashment in or out of the United States, by any bank
                            or institution subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, will
                            not be permitted.</p>
                        <p>Immediate authorization to take such action is requested.</p>

                        <p>A–633. Your 776, July 9. The Department does not desire to jeopardize the
                            prospects of effectively controlling this currency by insisting that it
                            be brought under the control of the Junta de Custodia, especially in
                            view of your indication that an “appropriate alternative” exists.</p>
                        <p>However, the Embassy’s despatch 778, September 10, 1942,<note n="37"
                                xml:id="d113fn37">Not printed.</note> contains certain information
                            modifying Article 9 of Law No. 66 of June 28, 1942, and drawing a
                            distinction between “frozen funds” and “controlled funds” under the
                            jurisdiction of the Junta. As the Embassy indicates that the Junta is
                            undoubtedly the agency best qualified to exercise supervision over the
                            funds, the Department would naturally prefer that the funds be delivered
                            to the custody of the Junta and in this connection it occurs to the
                            Department that the possible fears of the Spanish Minister to subjecting
                            the funds of the Italian Government to investment in Costa Rican defense
                            bonds might be met if the Junta considered the funds as “controlled”
                            rather than “frozen”.</p>
                        <p>It is desired that if you see no objection to so doing, you suggest to
                            the Minister of Finance or other appropriate authorities that they
                            approach the Spanish Minister with the suggestion that the funds would
                            be considered as “controlled” and not “frozen” which it is believed
                            would allay any fears of the Spanish Minister in regard to the possible
                            investment of these funds in Costa Rican defense bonds. You are also
                            authorized to inform the Spanish Minister that as an exceptional case
                            this Government would not object to the withdrawal by the power
                            representing Italian interests of such funds as may be necessary for the
                            payment of minimum subsistence to destitute Italians in Costa Rica, It
                            is assumed that these payments would not in any event exceed a total of
                            300 colones per month and it is suggested that the number of colones to
                            be withdrawn should be based upon the list of indigent Italian subjects
                            which the Embassy has requested be submitted.</p>
                        <p>If, however, the Embassy feels that in further proposing that the funds
                            be subjected to the control of the Junta the Embassy may <pb n="114"
                                xml:id="pg_114" facs="0128"/>jeopardize the possibilities of
                            subjecting the funds to other controls, the Embassy should not
                            necessarily press for control of the funds by the Junta but, before
                            taking final action, should report to the Department which of the three
                            alternatives suggested in the final sentence in numbered paragraph one
                            of the Embassy’s airgram under reference is considered by the Embassy to
                            be most desirable. Payment of minimum subsistence to indigent Italians
                            as referred to above would be permissible under the alternative
                            recommended.</p>
                        <p>The Department finds it difficult to recommend as between alternatives
                                <hi rend="italic">a</hi>), <hi rend="italic">b</hi>) and <hi
                                rend="italic">c</hi>) as referred to in your airgram because of the
                            important part which it appears is played by the personalities involved
                            in connection with the administration of the local controls. It
                            therefore appears that the Embassy is in a better position than the
                            Department to determine which of the three alternatives offers the best
                            prospects of effective blocking these funds for what may be a prolonged
                            period after they have been converted into colones. The Embassy realizes
                            that once the funds have been credited to the Banco de Costa Rica, the
                            control over these funds now held by this Government is ended and for
                            this reason it may continue to be desirable to permit the funds to
                            remain in the form of dollar bills until effective control over the
                            equivalent in colones would be established.</p>

                            by Spanish Minister and Owned by the Italian Government.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s Airgram A–633 of August 24th and to the previous
                            communications on the above subject and to report that the Minister of
                            Finance, Señor Francisco de P. Gutierrez has issued instructions to the
                            Junta de Custodia to block the funds held by the Spanish Minister in
                            Costa Rica for the Italian Government. A translation of the note sent by
                            the Minister of Finance to the Junta de Custodia on this subject is
                            transmitted herewith.<note n="38" xml:id="d114fn38">Not
                            printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Shortly after the appointment of Señor Gutierrez as Minister of Finance,
                            representatives of this Embassy called on him to discuss this subject
                            and left with him a memorandum<note n="38" xml:id="d114fn39">Not
                                printed.</note> outlining the facts in the case and requesting that
                            prompt action be taken. The Minister replied that he would give the
                            matter his immediate attention and a <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115"
                                facs="0129"/>few days later advised this Embassy that he was in
                            entire agreement with our position and that he was issuing appropriate
                            instructions. The note which he sent to the Junta de Custodia contains
                            all of the points which were set forth in the memorandum which had been
                            prepared by this Embassy. Señor Gutierrez informed the representatives
                            of this Embassy that the dollars would be changed into colones and that
                            the latter would be frozen under the control of the Junta de Custodia
                            but that the Spanish Minister would be permitted to draw no more than
                            ¢300 per month for payment of subsistence expenses to indigent Italians.
                            It will be recalled that this arrangement was approved by the Department
                            and the Treasury Department as announced in the Department’s Airgram
                            A–387 of March 27. It will be noted, however, that in his note to the
                            Junta de Custodia, the Minister of Finance not only fails to mention
                            that any withdrawals will be permitted, but also points to the
                            particular provision of the pertinent Washington Conference Resolution
                            and to the local law under which such withdrawals would not be
                            authorized.</p>
                        <p>It is expected that the dollars held by the Banco de Costa Rica will now
                            be transferred to the Banco Nacional to be converted into colones and
                            that the Banco Nacional will remit the dollars in question to the
                            Federal Reserve Bank in New York to be credited to its account there in
                            accordance with the understanding already reached with the Treasury
                            Department. The solution which has finally been found to the problem
                            which has been pending for almost a year would appear to be even more
                            favorable than had been expected by this Embassy, since the funds will
                            be controlled directly by the Junta de Custodia and since there is some
                            doubt as to whether any withdrawals at all will be permitted from the
                            account. As is quite evident, the Minister of Finance has taken this
                            action without consulting the Spanish Minister.</p>

                            545 of September 4. The Minister of Finance has instructed the Junta de
                            Custodia to take the necessary steps to convert the dollar <pb n="116"

                            this instruction was issued without his consent and has raised the
                            question whether the armistice concluded with the Italian Government may
                            not change the juridical status of these funds and make it inopportune
                            to take action at this time. Since I expect to discuss this matter
                            personally with the Foreign Minister later in the week I shall
                            appreciate receipt of the Department’s views by telegraph.</p>

                            country has not changed by reason of recent events in Italy, that no
                            Italian funds in this country have been unblocked because of these
                            events. Accordingly the attitude of this Government, that the funds in
                            question should be brought under effective control, remains
                            unchanged.</p>
                        <p>If it appears that effective control in Costa Rica is not to be

                            endeavor to have earmarked an appropriate amount of dollar currency for
                            Italian account and to obtain the serial number, denomination and series

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s circular instruction of August 20, 1943,<note n="43"
                                xml:id="d117fn43">Not printed.</note> regarding procedures and
                            policies on the maintenance of the Proclaimed List.</p>
                        <p>The instruction has been read with great care and interest and this
                            Embassy is fully in agreement with the principles underlying the
                            policies described therein. Regarding the specific application of these
                            policies to Costa Rica, the following observations are believed to be
                            pertinent:</p>
                        <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0131"/>
                        <p>With respect to future additions to the list in Costa Rica, the Embassy
                            believes that the limitation of recommendations in the manner described
                            in page 4 of the instruction is practicable and consonant with our
                            interests, and with these limitations it is believed that there will be
                            little, if any need for future additions, unless it is subsequently
                            found that cloaking operations cannot be adequately and effectively
                            controlled otherwise.</p>
                        <p>With respect to maintaining the Proclaimed List in Costa Rica as an
                            instrument of control, it is unanimously agreed in the Embassy that the
                            Costa Rican Government cannot now, or in the foreseeable future, be
                            depended upon to exercise effective controls without the support of the
                            Proclaimed List. It is believed, therefore, that an offer to delete all
                            or nearly all of the names on the list for Costa Rica as a means of
                            obtaining further action by the local authorities would not achieve the
                            desired results, and such deletions as should take place (which will be
                            described hereinafter) should be based on individual cases and on the
                            decision as to whether any control at all should continue to be
                            maintained in those cases. The reasons for this Embassy’s lack of
                            confidence in the ability of the Costa Rican authorities to maintain
                            adequate controls in the absence of the Proclaimed List are various:
                            firstly, Costa Rica inevitably looks to the United States to set the
                            pace in the field of economic warfare, as it does in many other fields.
                            This being the case, the elimination of our Proclaimed List
                            controls—regardless of our explanations and protests to the
                            contrary—would unquestionably be interpreted as an indication that a
                            stage of the war has been reached where a general relaxation of economic
                            warfare measures is desirable. Secondly, the Proclaimed List is the very
                            backbone of the Costa Rican controls. The control laws expressly refer
                            to the Proclaimed List and make the controls specifically applicable to
                            persons and firms on the list. Elimination of our Proclaimed List might
                            therefore require a substantial change in existing legislation. Thirdly,
                            it is probable that maintenance of our Proclaimed List has been mainly
                            responsible for such controls as have been established here and for the
                            measures which have been taken, particularly within the past year, with
                            regard to enemy property. As has been previously reported to the
                            Department, almost all of the enemy property expropriations which have
                            taken place to date have been expressly based on “the injury suffered by
                            the local economy by reason of the inclusion of the properties or
                            industries on the Proclaimed List” and the consequent necessity that
                            their ownership be transferred to desirable interests. Costa Rica is a
                            small country with a very high incidence of inter-marriages, and the
                            ties of blood and marriage are factors of great political weight. Costa
                            Rican authorities are often able to withstand pressure of this sort by
                            pointing to <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0132"/>the Proclaimed
                            List, over which they have no control, and justifying their actions on
                            the basis of the position in which they have been placed by reason of
                            the action of our Government. The Proclaimed List can therefore be
                            regarded as a wall which has protected and supported the local controls,
                            and if the wall should crumble, the disintegrating force of political
                            and family pressures would have free play. This is illustrated by the
                            fact that many persons who are on the list have been known to state that
                            they are not in the least disturbed by the controls maintained by the
                            Junta de Custodia; that their main concern is to get off the Proclaimed
                            List and if they succeed in doing so, they will be able to get along
                            even within the framework of the local controls. Likewise, Costa Rican
                            officials have sometimes approached this Embassy and requested that
                            specified persons whom they wish to control be included in the list, for
                            otherwise they would not be able to do so.</p>
                        <p>With all of the above considerations in mind, it is unquestionable that
                            much has been accomplished by local measures. The richest and most
                            important agricultural and industrial properties of Proclaimed List
                            nationals, aggregating about three million dollars in value (a large
                            figure for this country) have been expropriated; other firms have been
                            forced to liquidate, while many have been sold to desirable interests,
                            and the large bakery of Musmanni Hermanos has suspended operations for
                            almost a year. The Proclaimed List in Costa Rica is undoubtedly
                            cluttered with the names of many persons who are neither dangerous,
                            important, nor powerful, who own no property, and whose continued
                            control not only fails to serve a useful purpose but may actually be
                            detrimental to our interests. There are, for instance, individuals who
                            have been included in the list because of one or more cloaking
                            transactions in the past, which may have been the result of ignorance,
                            poor judgment or other factors, but not necessarily lack of sympathy
                            with our cause. The net effect of their inclusion in the list is that
                            they are not only unable to do business by themselves, but they are
                            unable to secure any employment, and they are faced with the
                            alternatives of being driven to complete dependence upon others in order
                            to subsist, or of seeking clandestine ways of earning their living. This
                            results in ill will toward the United States for what appears to be a
                            policy of persecution against individuals who cannot be regarded as
                            dangerous to our interests. It is not intended to intimate that our
                            Proclaimed List policy with regard to cloaking has been erroneous, for
                            it is firmly believed that the vigor with which this policy has been
                            executed has been a great deterrent to cloaking operations, but cloaking
                            is dangerous only insofar as it benefits interests which are inimical
                            and which should be controlled and the number of the latter in Costa
                            Rica is now substantially limited.</p>
                        <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0133"/>
                        <p>The Embassy proposes, therefore, to pursue the following procedure with
                            respect to the Proclaimed List in Costa Rica, and the Department’s views
                            on the desirability of this plan will be appreciated.</p>
                        <p>The Proclaimed List will be subjected to a careful and thorough revision
                            for the purpose of determining those names which, in any event, should
                            be kept on the list, either because they should be controlled and the
                            Embassy is satisfied that they would not otherwise be controlled, or
                            because their pro-Axis sentiments or Axis affiliations are so well and
                            commonly known that their deletion would have an unfavorable popular
                            effect. The remaining names could then be considered as proper cases for
                            exclusion from the list, but the Embassy would not recommend their
                            deletion in a block. It is believed the effect of a sudden and
                            substantial curtailment of the Proclaimed List would not be desirable,
                            from the point of view of the reaction of the local authorities as well
                            as of the public. Recommendations for deletion would be undertaken in a
                            gradual manner, starting with those cases which are most clearly proper
                            for such action and which have been on the list for the longest time. In
                            this manner, too, the effect of the policy could be gauged more properly
                            and if for any reason further curtailment of the list did not appear
                            desirable at a given stage, the process could be discontinued. It is
                            expected, however, that in this manner the Proclaimed List could
                            eventually be restricted to the nucleus of really “bad” cases, where
                            further deletion would be harmful to our interests.</p>
                        <p>Of course, if at any time it appeared that full reliance could be placed
                            on the local controls and that elimination of the list in Costa Rica
                            could be undertaken without detriment to our interests, the Department
                            would be so advised with a view to the establishment of a program along
                            the lines of that which is contemplated in the case of. Brazil.</p>

                            have elapsed since most of the enemy properties in Costa Rica were
                            expropriated by the Government under the provisions of law No. 26 of
                            December <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0134"/>12, 1942, and to this
                            date the appraisal proceedings have not yet been completed and none of
                            the properties has been offered for sale, as contemplated in that law.
                            As previously reported, the experts have submitted their valuation
                            reports to the court and it is now necessary for the judge to issue an
                            order establishing the value of the properties and fixing a date for
                            their sale at public auction. The Government’s attorney has now
                            presented a motion to the court in which he calls for the issuance of
                            the order.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, the attorney for Gmo. Niehaus &amp; Co. (PL<note n="45"
                                xml:id="d118fn45">Proclaimed List.</note>) Celso Gamboa, who has
                            been mainly responsible for the obstructionistic tactics which have
                            dragged out the proceedings over a period of so many months, has
                            presented a number of claims against the Government for alleged
                            arbitrary action and has asked the court to declare law No. 26 of
                            December 12, 1942, unconstitutional. Gamboa claims that article 18 of
                            said law violates his client’s constitutional rights in that it limits
                            their proof of damages (for the expropriation of the property) to the
                            testimony of experts. The legal basis of his claim is far from clear,
                            inasmuch as the parties were permitted to select their own experts, and
                            the latter are apparently free to adduce any type of evidence in support
                            of their claims, but this Embassy is not yet in possession of sufficient
                            information concerning the points raised by Señor Gamboa to determine
                            whether there is any merit behind them. It is known that Gamboa claims
                            that merchandise which belonged to his clients and which was stored in a
                            commissary at “Waldeck” and in their warehouse at Limon was arbitrarily
                            removed by political and military officials of the Government, and that
                            no compensation was made therefor. He apparently contends that under the
                            rules relating to the valuation of the properties which were
                            expropriated, his clients are unable to introduce proof of these
                            damages. Gamboa ends his appeal in this fashion: “Against innocent
                            victims of violations of law and justice perpetrated by other
                            governments, who, because of petty intrigues today have to endure the
                            moral and economic asphyxiation resulting from their inclusion in the
                            (Proclaimed) list,—against these people, I say, the sovereign,
                            constitutional Congress has unleashed all its force by means of an
                            interminable series of laws without paying any attention to
                            constitutional restrictions, and forgetting thus that force without
                            justice is tyranny.” Gamboa’s suit represents the strongest attack yet
                            made on enemy property legislation in Costa Rica and on the measures
                            taken thereunder.</p>

                            has <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0135"/>resorted to taking out
                            “Cédulas Hipotecarias” on some of the expropriated properties and using
                            these as security to borrow funds. These Cédulas are bearer mortgage
                            certificates and are readily acceptable in the local financial market.
                            It is officially reported that the Government has taken out Cédulas in
                            the value of ¢1,000,000 (one million colones) on Waldeck, a large cacao
                            farm expropriated from Gmo. Niehaus &amp; Co. and that the Government
                            also intends to mortgage the coffee crop of Hacienda “La Caja”, the best
                            and most valuable of the coffee properties, which was expropriated from
                            Hubbe Hijos (PL).</p>
                        <p>The Government is also continuing to use Defense Bonds, which were issued
                            under the authority of law No. 26 of December 12, 1942, to pay off
                            contractors and other creditors, although it is apparently finding it
                            increasingly hard to dispose of the bonds without a sizeable discount,
                            which amounts in some cases to 30 and 35%. When these bonds were
                            originally issued, it was generally understood that they would be used
                            exclusively as a means of payment for the expropriated enemy properties,
                            as well as a means whereby the Government could have the use of frozen
                            funds, which are required by law to be invested in Government
                            securities. Instead, the Government has resorted to disposing of these
                            bonds by sale in the open market and in the manner described above, with
                            the result that when the time comes to pay for the expropriated
                            properties the Government may be forced to put out a new bond issue.
                            Although two quarterly interest payments have come due on these bonds
                            since they were issued, no interest has yet been paid and the bonds are
                            generally considered a risky investment. On the other hand, Señor
                            Alberto Echandi, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, recently informed a
                            member of this Embassy that he had invested funds of his own in these
                            bonds, and that in his opinion the Government had made a mistake in
                            issuing these bonds, since they yield a high rate of interest (6% per
                            year)—and represent a “profitable” investment for enemy nationals. Sr.
                            Echandi indicated that after the war it might be a good policy for the
                            Costa Rican Government to borrow funds from the United States at 3% for
                            the purpose of calling in these bonds.</p>

                            their cases in view of recent developments in Italy. Recently a local
                            newspaper published an item to the effect that Proclaimed List Italians
                            in Costa Rica were planning to organize a committee to make formal
                            representations <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0136"/>to the United

                            controls and restrictions. This brought forth a formal statement from
                            Señor Echandi, Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which he asserted that
                            the recent armistice and other events concerning Italy had not altered
                            the status of Italians in Costa Rica and that the attitude and policy of
                            the Costa Rican Government with respect to them had undergone no change.
                            Señor Echandi’s statement has apparently discouraged the Italians from
                            further public agitation.</p>

                            response to pressure from the Spanish Minister in Costa Rica, who has
                            long been seeking to induce the Costa Rican Government to exclude all
                            Spanish nationals from economic and financial controls, the President
                            has issued Executive Decree No. 73, dated October 22, 1943, which
                            provides that for the purposes of article 3 of law No. 26 of December
                            12, 1942, Spanish nationals are to enjoy the same rights as Costa Rican
                            citizens. It is unlikely that the Spanish Minister, or Pedro Surroca
                            (PL) whom the former obviously sought to benefit, will be pleased with
                            this “solution”. Article 3 above mentioned provides that Costa Ricans
                            who are included in the Proclaimed List are subject to local controls
                            provided they have engaged in some activity contrary to the interests of
                            Costa Rica or its Allies. Inclusion in the Proclaimed List is evidently
                            considered to give rise to a presumption of such activity since the
                            burden of proof is held to rest on the person who seeks to be excluded
                            from the controls. By decreeing that Costa Ricans and Spaniards are to
                            be treated in the same manner, therefore, the Costa Rican Government has
                            hardly improved the latter’s position, while freeing itself of the
                            Charges of discrimination and treaty violation asserted by the Spanish
                            Minister.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State refers to the Embassy’s despatch no. 608 of
                            September 27, 1943, concerning procedures and policies with regard to
                            the maintenance of the Proclaimed List in Costa Rica and requesting the
                            Department’s views on the desirability of the plan proposed by the
                            Embassy.</p>
                        <p>The Department concurs in general with the views expressed by the Embassy
                            in this despatch, particularly with regard to the desirability of
                            maintaining the Proclaimed List in Costa Rica as an instrument of
                            control. With regard to the policy to be followed in <pb n="123"

                            the Department has the following comments to make:</p>
                        <p>In the case of the deletions of names included for cloaking activities,
                            the following criteria are suggested: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>The importance of the amount involved in the cloaking
                                    transaction as contrasted to the size of the business or assets

                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>Whether the transaction was entered into with knowledge of the
                                    possible consequences, or through ignorance or poor
                                    judgment;</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>In instances of repeated cloaking activities, the length of

                                <label>(4)</label>
                                <item>The political sympathies of the person and the attitude
                                    evinced by him toward the United States;</item>

                                <item>Whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that these
                                    cloaking activities would not be repeated subsequent to

                            </list></p>
                        <p>With regard to persons listed because of their political beliefs or
                            activities, it is not felt that deletions should be recommended unless
                            there are reasonable grounds to believe that the sympathies of the
                            person involved have actually undergone a change and that the
                            professions of pro-Allied beliefs are not made for expediency. It is
                            felt that the controlling factor should not be the lack of publicity
                            given to their pro-Axis sentiments or affiliations, but rather the
                            presence of a genuine change of sympathy, the severance of all Axis
                            affiliations, and the belief by the Embassy that the persons involved
                            will not in the future engage in inimical activities or the
                            dissemination of Nazi doctrines.</p>
                        <p>Recommendations for deletion should, as stated by the Embassy, be
                            considered individually in order that any curtailment of the List
                            resulting therefrom may be on a gradual basis. The Officer in Charge is
                            requested to report to the Department concerning any effect the
                            published deletions may have on Costa Rican public opinion.</p>

                                Rica, by banana planters who claimed that their original sales
                                contracts with those companies contained “gold clauses” which could
                                be interpreted to justify a price increase on bananas following the
                                United States devaluation of its gold dollar on January 31,
                                1934.</note> This decision which has not yet been published affirms
                            the decision of the lower court which was reported in my despatch under
                            reference and reverses the decision of the lower courts in one of the
                            cases which had been previously decided in favor of the United Fruit
                            Company.</p>
                        <p>On Monday afternoon the lower courts had ruled in favor of the United
                            Fruit Company in two other gold clause cases. I am informed fey the
                            chief attorney for the company however that the decision of the
                            Appellate Section of the Supreme Court will no doubt establish a
                            precedent on which subsequent appeals will be decided. He informs me
                            that there is one further course of action open to the company, namely,
                            submitting an appeal from the decision of the Appellate Section of the
                            Supreme Court to the Court of Cassation which is another section of the
                            Supreme Court composed of 5 judges rather than the 3 making up the
                            Appellate Section. The United Fruit Company will make such an appeal
                            within a few days.</p>
                        <p>I shall furnish the Department full details of the decisions by despatch

                        <p>The Department is concerned at the decision of the Appellate Section,
                            which is at variance with decisions of the Supreme Court in interpreting
                            this country’s policy regarding the important matter of gold clauses in
                            contracts. Moreover, the raising of the question of gold clause payments
                            at this late date would appear to constitute highly inequitable
                            treatment in view of the time which has elapsed and the whole course of
                            dealings between the United Fruit Company and Costa Rican citizens. Such
                            a decision if upheld would obviously be a deterrent to other capitalists

                        <p>(1) The three judges of the Appellate Section of the Supreme Court do
                                not sit in the Cassation Section of that Court; it being made up of
                                five other judges.</p>
                            <p>(2) The lawyers of the United Fruit Company do not know whether the
                                Cassation Section will uphold the decision of the Appellate Section.
                                They point out, however, that three of the five decisions rendered
                                in the lower courts were favorable to the Company, but that the
                                decision of the Appellate Section was unanimously against the
                                Company in the two suits decided by it. They also state that
                                recourse to Cassation is not an appeal with complete review of the
                                case, but a limited recourse for revising errors of law and some
                                errors of fact, and that the Cassation Section sustains the
                                judgement of the Appellate Section in a substantial majority of
                                cases.</p>
                            <p>(3) The lawyers for the Company have referred the matter of denial of
                                justice to the office of the General Counsel for the Company in
                                Boston, but they state that they are convinced the litigation
                                instituted <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0140"/>in these suits
                                is purely speculative, and that the legal and equitable position of
                                the Company is sound.</p>
                            <p>(4) The lawyers of the United Fruit Company believe that much
                                    litigation and confusion might arise as a result of an adverse
                                    decision by the Court of Cassation. They state that the courts
                                    in Costa Rica might adopt the viewpoint that any contract
                                    executed in dollars is subject to review on the grounds that any
                                    contract prior to 1934 contemplated the gold clause. They
                                    specifically mention the payment of dividends, interest,
                                    royalties or principal on dollar obligations dated prior to
                                    1934. With respect to the confusion that might arise the
                                    attorneys feel that an adverse decision in this case would upset
                                    established monetary policy of the United States, making the
                                    establishment of future monetary policy more difficult.</p>
                                <p>They also point out that Costa Rica is enjoying the advantages of
                                    payment of its own gold dollar bonds in the present money of the
                                    United States rather than in the currency which existed prior to
                                    1934. Or, in other words, Costa Rica is taking advantage of
                                    American monetary legislation to reduce its own debts without
                                    wishing to concede the same advantage to debtors located within
                                    Costa Rica.</p>
                                <p>The Fruit Company lawyers also feel that courts in other
                                    countries of the American Republics may attempt to extend the
                                    principle, which would be established by an adverse decision in
                                    this case, to any dollar contracts entered into prior to 1934 on
                                    the theory that such contracts contemplated payment in dollars
                                    of the gold content existing on the date of the contract. In
                                    this connection it should be pointed out that Señor
                                        Gutiérrez,<note n="51" xml:id="d122fn51">Francisco de Paula

                                    in these cases, has left for Colombia with the intention of
                                    instituting similar suits against the United Fruit Company in
                                    that country.</p>
                            <p>(5) The National Bank of Costa Rica is relieved of its obligation
                                    to redeem banknotes of the Banco Internacional de Costa Rica, in
                                    gold, by internal legislation. In September 1914, conversion of
                                    these notes was temporarily suspended by the Constitutional Law
                                    of the Banco Internacional de Costa Rica, Article IX, which
                                    stated: “…<note n="52" xml:id="d122fn52">Omission indicated in
                                        the original airgram.</note> their conversion shall begin
                                    one year from the date of the signing of the peace, or
                                    previously if the Executive so rules.” However, convertibility
                                    was not authorized, and various new laws were passed prolonging
                                    the suspension of convertibility until Law No. 19 of April 11,
                                    1921, according to which all banks were obliged to exchange
                                    their banknotes in accordance with Article 34 of the Banking
                                    Law. However, paragraph 2 of Article 1 of this law stated: “The
                                    Banco Internacional de Costa Rica shall be excluded from the
                                    provisions of this law, and its banknotes shall be convertible
                                    in a manner established by a forthcoming <pb n="127"
                                        xml:id="pg_127" facs="0141"/>law.” This law never appeared.
                                    In Law No. 64 of March 28, 1933, it was stated: “Within a period
                                    of two months from the publication of this law, the Caja de
                                    Conversión shall pay its banknotes in accordance with their
                                    text; and after this period in banknotes of the Banco
                                    Internacional de Costa Rica conforming, on day of payment, to
                                    the official exchange rate fixed by the Special Board of
                                    Exchange Control”. The banknotes of the Caja de Conversión read:
                                    “Banco Internacional de Costa Rica—Caja de Conversión—<hi
                                        rend="underline">x</hi> Colones in gold coin of the United
                                    States of America or drafts on New York in the option of the
                                    administrator at a rate of one dollar for each four
                                    colones.”</p>
                                <p>This law was superseded by Law No. 16 of March 5, 1936. Article 3
                                    of the Artículos Transitorios of this law states:</p>
                                <p>“The Issue Department (of the Banco Nacional de Costa Rica) shall
                                    take charge of the assets and liabilities of the Caja de
                                    Conversión, which shall be liquidated.</p>
                                <p>“Within a period of three months of the effective date of this
                                    law, the Issue Department shall redeem the banknotes of the Caja
                                    de Conversión in accordance with the regulations of Law No. 64
                                    of March 28, 1933; after this period it shall exchange them for
                                    banknotes of the Bank, at par, that is for face value in
                                    colones.”</p>
                            <p>(6) The United Fruit Company has been unofficially informed that the
                                Government does not intend to bring suit. However, this does not
                                bind any future Government not to do so. I have also been assured by
                                the President that his Government will not sue the Fruit
                                Company.</p>
                        <p>I have noted that the Department authorizes me “to express discreetly and
                            informally” the Department’s views to the President. In view of the
                            seriousness of the present situation, and the distinct likelihood that
                            an adverse decision will be rendered by the Court of Cassation, and in
                            view of the fact that, in accordance with the Department’s instructions
                            Nos. 230 of July 4, 1942 and 336 of August 10, 1942,<note n="53"
                                xml:id="d122fn53">Neither printed.</note> I have already
                            “informally” set forth the Department’s views in the course of several
                            conversations with the President on this subject, I feel that the
                            Department may wish its representations made by means of a formal note.
                            This might serve the dual purpose of impressing upon the President the
                            preoccupation of the Department, and at the same time give him valuable
                            backing which he could use in the conversations which he necessarily
                            must have with the judges in the Court of Cassation. I am fully aware of
                            the delicate issues involved and the Department’s traditional reluctance
                            to intervene in private lawsuits; nevertheless, the serious effect which
                            an adverse decision in these cases would have upon our interests, not
                            only in <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0142"/>Costa Rica but also in
                            many other countries, is such that the Department may feel justified in
                            adopting a firm stand at this time.</p>

                        <p>A–616. Reference the Department’s airgram No. A–434 of April 23, 1943,
                            6:00 p.m. According to an opinion furnished the United Fruit Company by
                            a prominent local attorney and economist, internal emergency legislation
                            protects certain debts incurred prior to December 17, 1931. However,
                            according to this opinion, an unfavorable decision by the Court of
                            Cassation would open the way for gold clause suits with respect to: 1)
                            the external debt of Costa Rica; 2) obligations of coffee growers and
                            other exporters where contracts were executed in “centavos oro
                            americano”; 3) rental payments for real property stipulated in “centavos
                            oro americano”; 4) other internal obligations executed in gold coin or
                            with a “gold clause”, and executed after December 17, 1931.</p>
                        <p>As an example of the type of obligation which might become the subject of
                            suit in the event of an unfavorable ruling, one of the attorneys of the
                            Fruit Company checked local mortgage records, and found, from a cursory
                            examination, some twenty-six mortgages which might be held to contain
                            gold clauses.</p>
                        <p>The attorneys for the Fruit Company point out that inasmuch as many of
                            these mortgages were executed after 1933, and still use <pb n="129"
                                xml:id="pg_129" facs="0143"/>the term “centavos oro americano”, it
                            is further proof of their contention that the phrase is generally used
                            to mean United States currency and not a gold clause. Attorneys for the
                            Company are looking into other types of internal transactions in order
                            to determine what other types of case might be considered to constitute
                            material for a gold clause suit, and I shall inform the Department of
                            the result of their investigations.</p>
                        <p>It is expected that the decision of the Court of Cassation will be handed
                            down about September 1.</p>
                        <p>A second appeal of the Fruit Company before the Appellate Section of the
                            Supreme Court has also been handed down and was unfavorable to the
                            Company, as was the first decision. The attorneys for the Company are
                            preparing a digest of the opinion which I will forward to the Department
                            as soon as it is available.</p>

                                <p>A. Two suits were instituted, one against the United Fruit
                                        Company of New Jersey and the other against the Compañía
                                        Bananera de Costa Rica, of Wilmington, Delaware. Both suits
                                        were for the collection of a sum of money due as the
                                        difference in the price of bananas received by said
                                        companies which difference is caused by the devalorization
                                        of the dollar.</p>
                                    <p>The first suit against the United Fruit Company was for
                                        (estimated) the sum of six hundred thousand colones.
                                        ($85,770.82 with interest in the amount of $28,799.93.)</p>
                                    <p>The second suit against the Compañía Bananera de Costa Rica
                                        “was estimated to be the same as that of the United Fruit”
                                        case. The Compañía Bananera de Costa Rica “acquired by
                                        purchase all of the properties of the United Fruit Company
                                        in Costa Rica and took charge of the business of purchasing
                                        and exporting bananas, which it did as amply as its
                                        predecessor had done”. (Page 5 Decision.)</p>
                                    <p>The decision dismisses both suits in so far as the United
                                        Fruit Company is concerned on the ground that after January
                                        31, 1934 the Company did not receive bananas from the
                                        plaintiff and that, <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0144"
                                        />therefore, it is not liable for deliveries made to “a
                                        separate concern” (the Compañía Bananera de Costa Rica, its
                                        successor in interest).</p>
                                <p>B. In the suit against the Compañía Bananera de Costa Rica the
                                    Court held first that: <list>

                                            from the responsibilities which they may have incurred
                                            during its existence “in as much as it was not a clear
                                            and definite remission with respect to the matter”.

                                        <item>The Court held that Article 9 of the contract besides
                                            fixing the price in American gold cents permitted the
                                            purchaser to pay in drafts on New York or in money of
                                            the country at the rate of exchange at which the Bank of
                                            Costa Rica might purchase drafts of the same kind, thus
                                            instituting a “gold value clause”. The Court held that
                                            the use of the word “gold” revealed the intention of the
                                            parties to establish a special guaranty clause and that
                                            its ordinary interpretation has called for computation
                                            by reference to the value of the gold contained in the
                                            money of the contract. The Court further stated that the
                                            gold clause “does not involve a rigid obligation to
                                            deliver coined money of a single monetary regime; it
                                            admits perfectly the alternative of paying in another
                                            money, but taking into account the value of the latter
                                            in relation to gold; and when this happens it is
                                            converted into a gold value clause, whether by agreement
                                            of the parties—as in this case—or by order of the judges
                                            in the event of impossibility of obtaining the metallic
                                            specie contemplated.” …<note n="54" xml:id="d125fn54"

                                            the terms of the contract the purchaser could pay the
                                            value of the fruits in American gold colones, or its

                                            gold content of the American dollar with checks for the

                                            governing exchange control was not admitted. The Court
                                            held that the contract, which was executed and completed
                                            in Costa Rica, was governed by Costa Rican law “which in
                                            this case was the only one normally competent to fix the
                                            element of payment of the contract.”</item>

                                                fulfillment is demanded.” It was further held that
                                                Costa Rican laws which provided for other regulation
                                                for the control of exchange and export of gold and
                                                foreign bills and drafts did not do away with the
                                                principle of the validity of stipulation in foreign

                                                Civil Code orders that the former money be computed
                                                according to the commercial and real value which it
                                                may have at the moment of payment, in relation to
                                                the money owed. In this relation the Court
                                                stated:
                                            <quote rend="blockquote">“Now, when the contracting parties choose gold as the
                                                standard of value by their express will, the
                                                comparison between the money of the contract and
                                                that of payment must be made necessarily by
                                                reference to the value of gold contained in the one
                                                and the other of said moneys. If the debtor finds
                                                himself in the physical impossibility of paying the
                                                money agreed upon, because the latter is not in
                                                circulation, as happens here, and the gold agreement
                                                contracted is legally demandable here, the clause
                                                really operates as a gold value clause and the
                                                payment is made by means of the delivery of a number
                                                of units of the new system whose price corresponds
                                                to that of the gold units which are owed. To
                                                determine the depreciation of a money in relation to
                                                a gold base, it is necessary to refer to the premium
                                                of the metal, not only because of dealing with a
                                                gold value which is perfectly determinable, but
                                                because the implicit will of the parties is that the
                                                money of payment shall be equivalent to an amount of
                                                precious metal equal to that contained in the money
                                                of the contract. This criterion of parity of coinage
                                                performs a very important office in North American
                                                decisions, where it is warmly praised. Consequently,
                                                to establish the difference between two metallic
                                                systems, although one may be so in theory only, as
                                                in the present case, recourse is had to par of

                            corporation authorized to do business in Costa Rica. The United Fruit

                            Law, from 25.8 grains to 155/21 grains of gold. During the period of
                            some five years following this devaluation, the vendors delivered to
                            Compañía Bananera de Costa Rica, a Delaware corporation which succeeded
                            United Fruit Co., some 240,000 bunches of bananas for which Compañía
                            paid the vendors some $120,000 by means of bank checks, a part in
                            colones (the Costa Rican monetary unit) and the rest in American
                            dollars. The vendors’ successor thereafter brought suit in the Civil
                            Court of San José, Costa Rica, to recover an additional sum of some
                            $85,000, on the ground that payment was called for in the original gold
                            dollar but had been made in a devalued dollar worth only about sixty
                            percent of its former value. The court entered judgment for plaintiff,
                            and the First Appellate Section of the Supreme Court affirmed.</p>
                        <p>There can be little doubt that the Costa Rican courts had jurisdiction of
                            the controversy and of the parties. Any criticism of the decision must
                            therefore be directed solely to its legal merits, and Assistant Attorney
                            General Shea’s memorandum discusses the decision from that aspect.</p>
                        <p>According to the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> of August 23,
                            1943, the Superior Court of Costa Rica—the court of last resort—has
                            recently reversed the judgment, holding that the contract did not
                            contain a true gold clause, and that since the Costa Rican colones had
                            not appreciated with respect to the dollar the plaintiff had not
                            suffered any appreciable damage. Since the final decision in this case
                            is favorable to American business men who had entered into obligations
                            to pay gold dollars in Costa Rica, the interest of your Department in
                            the controversy <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0148"/>may have
                            terminated. However, in view of the fact that the principles involved in
                            this litigation may arise in other countries in which American firms
                            have undertaken similar contractual obligations, the enclosed memorandum
                            from Assistant Attorney General Shea may prove of value.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: Reference is made to your letter of
                            June 2, 1943,<note n="63" xml:id="d128fn63">Not printed.</note>
                            enclosing a copy of a translation of a decision of the First Appellate
                            Section of the Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica, relative to
                            litigation involving a “gold value clause” in contracts to which
                            American firms are parties. I regret the unfortunate delay in replying
                            to your letter.</p>
                        <p>This opinion has been carefully considered. It would appear that some of
                            the statements contained therein, such as that the purpose of the Joint
                            Resolution of June 5, 1933, was to increase the prices of agricultural
                            commodities and that the purchasing power of the dollar was reduced
                            after the monetary reforms at that time, may be inaccurate. However, it
                            does not appear that these matters were essential to the decision
                            reached by the court.</p>
                        <p>The fundamental conclusion that the contracts involved are governed by
                            the law of Costa Rica would appear to be legally justifiable, and the
                            fact that the Costa Rican court did not give effect to the Joint
                            Resolution of June 5, 1933, as a matter of comity, is hardly subject to
                            criticism in view of decisions of our own courts in cases involving
                            similar statutes of other countries. See <hi rend="italic">Central

                            has been found necessary to iron out several minor problems. The draft
                            has received general approval in the Cuban Ministry of State, although
                            it is likely that it may suggest some specific changes.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this agreement is to broaden the scope of certain articles
                            of previous agreements and to include such new commitments as may be
                            desirable. The summary that follows may be helpful in indicating the
                            suggested changes from existing agreements.</p>
                        <p>Col. D. B. Wilson<note n="13" xml:id="d131fn13">Donald B. Wilson, Latin

                            Department might wish to draft, for inclusion, an article bringing up to
                            date the use and purpose of the Batista Airport at San Antonio de los
                            Baños, since it is no longer to be used for training British bombardment
                            crews. I am endeavoring to send copies of the draft agreement to Col.
                            Wilson and to Navy.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has suggested possible revision of Article XII of the
                            agreement of June 19, 1942, which provides for a <hi rend="italic"

                            with this matter and his ideas on adjusting the apparent existing
                            conflict will be most helpful.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy’s draft requires the exchange of full powers, which I hope
                            may be avoided as I feel the subject matter does not warrant reference
                            to the White House. Furthermore, Article IV of the Agreement <pb n="140"
                                xml:id="pg_140" facs="0154"/>of September 7, 1942, provides
                            specifically for supplementary revisions of the agreement.</p>

                        <p>Article XII of the 1942 agreement is objectionable because it is confined
                            to claims of a particular category instead of including all claims
                            arising out of acts of members of the armed forces and because the
                            Department cannot by executive agreement clothe a joint commission with
                            jurisdiction to settle definitively claims against the United States of
                            the kind referred to. Provision for the settlement <pb n="144"
                                xml:id="pg_144" facs="0158"/>of claims for injury to persons or
                            property of inhabitants of foreign countries by members of the armed
                            forces of the United States has been made in the Act of Congress
                            approved January 2, 1942, as amended by the Act approved April 22, 1943.
                            These Acts provide for the establishment of military claims commissions
                            to adjudicate and settle such claims. Some time ago the War Department
                            suggested that we endeavor to have the Cuban Government consent to the
                            abrogation of Article XII because it did not feel that it could legally
                            appoint persons to membership on the joint commission or make payment of
                            its awards. Under the amended Act, claims up to $5,000 in amount can be
                            settled without reference to Congress and the Secretaries of War and
                            Navy are authorized to certify to Congress for payment claims in excess
                            of that amount.</p>
                        <p>It would seem that these Acts of Congress provide a more expeditious and
                            satisfactory method of settling claims than the joint commission
                            provided for in the 1942 agreement. It would, of course, be open to Cuba
                            to decline to accept offers of settlement by the military claims
                            commissions or by the Secretaries of War or Navy and to present the
                            claims through diplomatic channels. In view of the experience of the
                            claims commissions in other countries, however, it is believed that
                            there will be no occasion for presenting diplomatic claims. Individual
                            claimants are, of course, free to accept or reject the commission’s
                            awards and any legal remedies open to them in the courts are not
                            interfered with.</p>
                        <p>Since the proposed Article IV is broader in scope than the article in the
                            1942 agreement and awards made under it in cases under:$5,000 can be
                            promptly paid from available funds without reference to Congress, it is
                            believed that the Cuban Government will have no difficulty in
                            appreciating the superior merits of such an arrangement.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that the form of the supplementary agreement be changed.
                            The Department sees no necessity for an exchange of full powers and
                            feels that the arrangement might appropriately take the form of a note
                            addressed by the Embassy to the Minister of State setting forth the
                            several articles and concluding with a statement that if these articles
                            are acceptable to the Cuban Government, a note from that Government so
                            stating would be regarded as placing the agreement in effect. An
                            alternative method would be to incorporate the agreement in a single
                            document to be signed by the Ambassador and the Minister of State on
                            behalf of their respective Governments. Whichever procedure is preferred
                            by the Cuban Government might be followed.</p>
                        <p>The following changes in the text of the proposed agreement are
                            suggested. Replace “Agreement of September 7, 1942” in Article I <pb
                                n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0159"/>by “Agreement for Military and
                            Naval Cooperation between the Government of the United States of America
                            and the Government of the Republic of Cuba signed at Habana, September
                            7, 1942”. Replace “Government of Cuba” or “Cuban Government” wherever
                            used by “Government of the Republic of Cuba”. Replace “United States
                            Government” wherever used by “Government of the United States of
                            America”. Replace “United States” and “Cuba” wherever used by “United
                            States of America” and “The Republic of Cuba”. In Article V after
                            “cooperation” insert “between the United States of America and the
                            Republic of Cuba”.</p>

                            a security area only at Nicaro and that the possibility of providing

                        <p>The attitude of the Prime Minister and the Minister of State, as recently
                            expressed informally, is to the effect that as a practical matter,
                            taking into consideration the Cuban Constitution and treaty procedure,
                            it would be preferable not to include an article on
                            military-jurisdiction over members of the armed forces of the United
                            States; in Cuba in the draft supplementary agreement for military and
                            naval cooperation between the United States and Cuba or to reach an
                            agreement independently on the subject by an exchange of notes but
                            rather to continue the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> in force. Up to
                            the present time, there has been little difficulty encountered with
                            respect to the prompt surrendering to the competent American military or
                            naval authorities for adjudication of their cases of members of the
                            armed forces of the United States whom the Cuban authorities have
                            detained. The present arrangement, therefore, appears satisfactory to
                            both the American and Cuban Governments and consequently the Embassy is
                            taking no further action in the matter at this time.</p>

                        <p>As Article XII of Agreement for Military Cooperation signed June 19, 1942
                            refers only to Batista Airport at San Antonio de los Banos, Embassy is
                            of the opinion that claims resulting from explosion in Habana Harbor on
                            February 6, 1943 can be considered under the Act of January 2, 1942 as
                            amended April 22, 1943.</p>
                        <p>As joint Cuban-American Claims Commission contemplated by Article XII of
                            Military Agreement of June 19, 1942, has never been set up and as
                            informal conversations with a high official of the Ministry of State
                            have indicated that changes contemplated by Department’s undated
                            instruction no. 1875<note n="37" xml:id="d138fn37">Dated June 30, <ref
                                    target="#pg_143">p. 143</ref>.</note> would be difficult for
                            Cuban Government to accept because of their unilateral nature, Embassy
                            recommends that negotiations on this point be dropped and that claims be
                            handled under Acts of Congress referred to above. Embassy contemplates
                            no great difficulty for claims resulting from our activities at Batista
                            Airport, particularly if cases are considered expeditiously and payments
                            are made promptly. As Department has pointed out in its instruction no.
                            1875, the regular legal remedies (including, presumably, diplomatic
                            processes) remain open to claimants who do not wish to follow procedure
                            provided by these Acts of Congress.</p>
                        <p>As most of the problems originally contemplated for solution by means of
                            a supplementary agreement have now been resolved by direct negotiations
                            with Cuban authorities, Embassy does not now contemplate negotiating
                            supplementary agreement referred to in Embassy’s despatch no. 2314 of
                            February 26, 1943<note n="36" xml:id="d138fn38">Not printed.</note> and

                        <p>A–2382. Your A–2051, October 4.</p>
                        <p>Department is aware that claims arising out of explosion of Army barge in
                            harbor of Habana can be considered under the Act of January 2, 1942, as
                            amended, and that they do not fall within jurisdiction of the Claims
                            Commission provided for in Article XII of Agreement for Military
                            Cooperation of June 19, 1942. However, this Government desired to obtain
                            agreement of Cuban Government to submission of all claims for damages
                            arising from acts of members of the armed forces of the United States in
                            Cuba to Commissions provided for in the Act of January 2, 1942, If Cuban
                            Government is not agreeable to such an arrangement, this Government does
                            not desire to press the matter, and the War Department advises that it
                            will proceed to set up a Commission under the Act of January 2, 1942 to
                            consider Cuban claims. However, the existence of Article XII of the
                            Agreement of June 19, 1942 is an impediment to the exercise by such a
                            Commission of jurisdiction over claims within the purview of Article
                            XII. For this reason and, since the obligations undertaken in Article
                            XII cannot be carried out, this Government considers its abrogation
                            imperative. You will, therefore, please endeavor to obtain the consent
                            of the Cuban Government to such abrogation.</p>

                            United States financial assistance to Cuban cable, telegraph and radio

                        <p>From various confidential sources the Embassy has learned of the
                            widespread use of the mails for the transmission of Communist plans and
                            there is a strong presumption that telecommunications may also be used

                            that this constitutes an added reason for the use of United States

                        <p>No. A–2193. Reference Department’s airgram no. 2382, October 18, 7:10
                            p.m., file no. 837.30/89. The Embassy does not share the opinion that
                            the abrogation of Article 12 of the Agreement for Military Cooperation
                            of June 19, 1942 is imperative. Apparently a Commission can be set up
                            under the Act of January 2, 1942 to consider Cuban claims in general,
                            despite the existence of Article 12. Should a claim arise to which
                            Article 12 is applicable and an amicable settlement not be obtainable, I
                            am of the opinion that the subject might then be reviewed. Possibly this
                            contingency may never arise. By initiating action, I fear that it may
                            invite from the Cuban Government requests for other modifications.</p>
                        <p>The Ministry of State has shown no disposition to consider favorably the
                            article on claims contained in the Department’s undated instruction no.
                                1875;<note n="42" xml:id="d142fn42">Dated June 30, p.143.</note>
                            therefore only Cuban claims freely submitted to it may be considered by
                            a Commission set up under the Act of January 2, 1942.</p>
                        <p>It is hoped therefore that the Department will reconsider the position

                        <p>Since receipt of Department’s telegram 868, September 20, 7 p.m.
                            authorizing allotment of $150,000 to assist in Cuban postal censorship I
                            have been endeavoring and hoping against hope from day to day to reach
                            an agreement with the Prime Minister and other Cuban authorities which
                            would insure effective and honest expenditure of these funds which they
                            would of course be glad to have if we were willing to turn them over
                            without any strings attached. This I will not do.</p>
                        <p>(It is pertinent to observe that allotment of monies from President’s
                            special fund for purposes of internment was promptly granted and this
                            program is now functioning effectively. Unfortunately the delay of over
                            a year in granting similar allotment (which was requested at same time)
                            for purposes of postal censorship has given Cuban officials opportunity
                            to discover what a rich field for graft this is.)</p>
                        <p>It now seems apparent that some of these authorities have concluded that
                            our collaboration in this highly important war effort might impede
                            blackmail and sale of information now practiced in the Cuban censorship
                            office as well as the graft in purchases and in rackets (and it
                            certainly would bring the details of these rackets to our knowledge).
                            They are unwilling to forego these illicit perquisites, <pb n="151"
                                xml:id="pg_151" facs="0165"/>despite the fact that they have been
                            informed and are aware of the great value of censorship in our mutual
                            war effort.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the foregoing, unless there very soon is a complete
                            about-face by the Cuban authorities, I will recommend that our offer to
                            assist financially be withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>Also I am studying and will report so [<hi rend="italic">as</hi>] soon as
                            possible whether the services of Major Keller<note n="48"

                                February 19, 1944.</note> and his two assistants, valuable though
                            they have been, should be continued here in the light of the shocking
                            conditions prevailing and the entire disinclination of the censorship
                            chief to cooperate with him. Also in this matter there is a limit beyond
                            which we cannot go with dignity. Similarly I will consider
                            recommendations in respect to retention of Braga or his replacement.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, under the aforedescribed circumstances nothing should be done
                            in respect to our participation in cable censorship, at least until the
                            Cuban censorship situation has been cleaned up to our entire
                            satisfaction. As a result of an altogether unsatisfactory conversation

                        <p>It is interesting to observe that the Cuban Government representatives
                            neither supported nor rejected the views of the industry as expressed at
                            the meeting with President Batista.<note n="55" xml:id="d144fn55">A

                                the Presidential Palace, attended by President Fulgencio Batista y
                                Zaldivar, Prime Minister Ramón Zaydín, Minister of State José A.

                        <p>The situation boils down to the fact that the Cuban Government is being
                            so strongly pressured by a special-interest group that it is unable to
                            deal with the problem on the merits. The question confronting this
                            Government is how far should we depart from a proposal which in its
                            broad outline is equitable in order to permit the Cuban Government to
                            satisfy the large appetites of the sugar interests. This is a very real
                            problem because it is other United States Government agencies which are
                            putting up the money in this deal. If our “final” offer is to be
                            substantially improved I believe very careful thought should be given as
                            to the best way to obtain the acquiescence of the agencies which will be
                            required to advance greater funds of money.</p>

                            instructions to present to the Cuban Government a last “take it or leave
                            it” proposal. In view of tense atmosphere existing throughout the island
                            and of our desire to assist Batista Government to maintain a tranquil,
                            stable situation socially and politically I respectfully suggest that I
                            be afforded an opportunity to comment on this proposal before it is
                            presented. Also it would probably be useful for me to receive <pb

                                this airgram the Department summarized for the Ambassador a
                                modification of its December 17 proposal, and indicated its
                                readiness to accept from the Cuban Government a “firm
                                counterproposal” embodying the several alterations itemized therein
                                (837.61351/3626a).</note> He stated that he was very much depressed
                            at the terms of our latest proposal. In particular, he felt that the
                            price of $2.55 proposed by us would be most adversely received by the
                            Cubans—both the Government and the industry.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated that he questioned the wisdom of presenting this
                            proposal to the Cubans at all. He said that it would undermine President
                            Batista and that the Prime Minister would undoubtedly have to resign.
                            The Ambassador proposed two alternatives: <list>

                                <item>Our current proposal with a $2.65 price. He said he believed
                                    he could put this across and get the President’s support.</item>

                                <item>A proposal based upon the Ambassador’s suggestions of the past
                                    few weeks, i.e., 2,700,000 at $2.65 with 300,000 tons of free
                                    sugar subject to a stock pile contribution in the event of an
                                    inter-American agreement on the subject.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I explained to the Ambassador the difficulties of our situation here in
                            relation to the other agencies. I stated that I would submit his
                            suggestions to you.</p>

                        <p>(Personally, I have, as you know, questioned the desirability of the
                            $2.55 price contained in the latest BEW–CCC<note n="66"
                                xml:id="d146fn66">Board of Economic Warfare and Commodity Credit

                            proposal. I believe that we should attempt, on purely political grounds
                            to secure the consent of these agencies to the $2.65 price. The
                            Ambassador stressed that “the situation is very bad”.)</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador also mentioned two minor points: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    that we would consent to assume storage and insurance charges
                                    after June 30, 1944, whereas our current proposal gives December

                                    referring to our ceiling price proposal or escalator clause, the
                                    Ambassador indicated the desirability of assurances on our part
                                    that we would not give away the sugar which we are buying. I
                                    suppose that what he has in mind is that we will sell it through
                                    normal channels and not use it for relief purposes, the result
                                    of which might be to eliminate the possibility of any profit
                                    which would later be handed over to the Cuban Government and
                                    people. I made it very clear that there was no thought of
                                    turning over any profit directly to the sugar industry—I believe
                                    he is in full agreement on this point.</p></quote></p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have, as you know,
                                given the most careful personal study to the problem of Cuba’s 1943
                                sugar crop which has occupied the attention of our two Governments
                                during the past few weeks. I am confident that the proposal made
                                last December met all <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0170"/>the
                                reasonable requirements of the situation. However, since that date,
                                I have given further consideration to the matter, with the result
                                that Ambassador Braden has now been authorized to indicate to you
                                certain modifications of our original proposal which, if proposed by
                                the Cuban Government, would be acceptable to this Government.</p>
                            <p>The proposal as it now stands provides for the expenditure in Cuba of
                                approximately $150,000,000 on a commodity which, because of
                                conditions with which you are fully familiar, cannot be used
                                directly in the war effort of the United Nations. I recognize, of
                                course, that it is fully consistent with the cooperative
                                relationship which has so happily existed between our two countries
                                for this Government to be of assistance at this time. However, the
                                immense and constantly-increasing burdens which the people of the
                                United States are being called upon to bear and the sacrifices of
                                every variety which we must all make render it impossible to justify
                                an expenditure greater than that which will suffice to maintain
                                employment and living conditions in Cuba on a war-time basis.</p>
                            <p>I am confident that your statesmanlike vision of the world situation
                                which I had the pleasure of again confirming on the occasion of your
                                visit here last month will enable you fully to comprehend the
                                problem with which our two Governments are now confronted and to
                                lend your full support to the proposal which Ambassador Braden will
                                outline to you.</p>

                                Briggs.</note> relative to the sugar negotiations conducted by our
                            Government between September 1942 and the present, particularly with
                            respect to the various obstacles which retarded the reaching of an
                            agreement. These obstacles may be summarized as follows: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Failure of the Cuban sugar industry to face the realities of
                                    1943. This was influenced in considerable measure by the large
                                    profits made in 1942, and by the resistance of many producers to
                                    accepting the inevitability of smaller profits in 1943.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Efforts by a substantial group of <hi rend="italic"
                                        >hacendados</hi>, especially those with a large speculative
                                    investment in cane, to torpedo the negotiations. These efforts
                                    were seconded by the Opposition, which sought throughout the
                                    negotiations to embarrass the Government and to make political
                                    capital out of the delays and the fact that the terms inevitably
                                    would be less attractive than in 1942.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Timidity, vacillation and lack of vigor on the part of the
                                    Cuban Government contributed greatly to the difficulties of the
                                    situation.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The primary obstacle in my opinion was the attitude of the Cuban
                            producers, who fought tooth and nail to retain in the 1943 agreement
                            provisions which our Government accepted last year but which in the
                            light of war developments, especially transportation difficulties, we
                            did not feel in a position to assume in 1943. In some ways it is
                            difficult to find excuses for the attitude of the Cuban sugar industry
                            in general, while the activities of certain <hi rend="italic"
                                >hacendados</hi> were extraordinarily short-sighted and dangerous,
                            particularly with respect to their influence on fundamental
                            Cuban-American relations.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand the Cuban disposition to live from day to day, the
                            psychology inherent in a one-crop country and the still
                            prevailing—despite continuous educational efforts by the Embassy—lack of
                            war consciousness have made it more difficult for the Cubans to
                            recognize the cold facts of the existing situation. Also we must
                            regretfully admit that they have been misinformed and misdirected by
                            some of the Americans interested in sugar and who should have known
                            better. It is pertinent to observe that these American interests never
                            called at the Embassy to inquire as to the facts surrounding the
                            negotiations nor much less to proffer their cooperation in a
                            self-evidently difficult situation which might adversely affect our
                            relations. <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0176"/>On the contrary,
                            some of the most acrid denunciation of the United States Government
                            policy emanated from these people (see my despatch no. 2055 of January
                                26<note n="83" xml:id="d152fn83">Not printed.</note>). Similarly
                            statements issued by the press and by bulletins in the United States
                            were harmful.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of the present outlook, the negotiations relative to the
                            1944 crop should be by no means so difficult as those for the 1943 crop,
                            since the anticipated carryover should exert a sobering influence on
                            producers, who should become increasingly alive to need for accepting
                            sacrifices, and moreover the procedure and conditions to be incorporated
                            in the 1943 contract should, by reason of their inclusion this year,
                            with far less difficulty be accepted by the Cubans next year. Finally,
                            the exaggerated optimism which resulted in so much planting during the
                            latter months of 1941 and the early part of 1942, is notably absent at
                            the present time, and we should therefore not have to contend a year
                            hence with the allegations so interminably reiterated in connection with
                            the 1943 negotiations that we had “encouraged” Cuba to plant as much
                            cane as possible.</p>
                        <p>I realize that the extent of our future requirements depends to an
                            important degree on the production of sugar in continental United
                            States, and that the difficulty of obtaining labor, particularly in the
                            beet fields, may result in a considerably smaller continental crop than
                            was envisaged a few months ago. I assume that this possibility has been
                            discounted in connection with estimates on which our present purchases
                            are being made, since few things would cause us to be ridiculed more,
                            with a resultant adverse general effect on our sugar relations with Cuba
                            (and hence on our general relations) than a reversal similar to that
                            which occurred in the progressive scaling-down of our requirements
                            estimates from March to September, 1942.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the 1944 crop negotiations themselves, it is suggested
                            that if they be held in Washington they be undertaken by a smaller
                            American Government group, and that they be pushed more intensively than
                            was possible during November and December of last year. I believe the
                            complaint of the Cuban Government against being faced by a “regiment of
                            American negotiators” has some justification and that should a Cuban
                            commission proceed to the United States in the latter part of this year,
                            it would be better to have the American negotiators number not more than
                            three or four persons, under the chairmanship of an official of the
                            Department of State.</p>

                        <p>201. Your A–276, February 10, 9:05 a.m. The Cuban counterproposal has
                            been carefully studied by the interested Government agencies. You are
                            requested to present to the Cuban Government a memorandum, of which the
                            text is quoted hereafter. As will be seen after reading this text, the
                            two Governments are in accord on the principal features of the proposed
                            sale of the 1943 crop. It is fair to say that there is not only an
                            agreement in principle on all of the important points essential to a
                            satisfactory arrangement but there is also substantial agreement on what
                            ultimately will be various clauses in the contract. It has been felt
                            necessary, however, in order to avoid future complications in connection
                            with the drafting of the contract to rephrase certain paragraphs of the
                            counterproposal presented by the Cuban Government. This has been deemed
                            desirable in order (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) to make certain paragraphs
                            conform more exactly to what at least has been our understanding of the
                            outcome of earlier discussions and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) to set
                            forth our point of view with respect to certain paragraphs that appear
                            for the first time in any proposal, such as the paragraphs on
                            direct-consumption sugar and the quota for producers of syrup.</p>
                        <p>In as much as the principal features of this deal have now been agreed
                            upon, the best procedure would seem to be for appropriate
                            representatives of the two Governments and of the Cuban Sugar
                            Stabilization Institute to meet together and, on the basis of the Cuban
                            counterproposal as amended and clarified by our memorandum, to draft the
                            text of the contract. Any other procedure, such as the continued
                            exchange of memoranda, seems not only unnecessary but also inefficient.
                            It is therefore proposed that the Cuban representatives proceed to
                            Washington at the earliest possible moment for the drafting of the
                            contract.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Braden telephoned me late yesterday evening to tell me that he
                            and Zaydín had agreed on a statement regarding the sugar negotiations.
                            He read it to me over the telephone and I gave him the Department’s
                            approval. The statement is very brief and is not completely
                            satisfactory. It refers to the fact that “certain details remain to be
                            clarified” and states that representatives of the Cuban Government and
                            of the Institute are coming to Washington for the purpose of drawing up
                            the definitive contract. It gives the quantities of sugar to be made,
                            but makes no mention of the stock pile. It also mentions diversification
                            and the public works program.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador tells me that López Castro<note n="85a" xml:id="d154fn85a"

                        <p>There seem to be two principal points of difference remaining between
                            ourselves and the Cubans: <list>

                                    contribution, and</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>The question of whether the roughly 39,000 tons required for
                                    the manufacture of syrup can be made by the few mills which
                                    manufacture syrup in addition to their quotas under the
                                    allocation of the 3,225,000 ton crop or whether they must
                                    manufacture the syrup from their normal quotas. I am rather
                                    inclined to favor the Cuban contention, since during the last
                                    seven or eight years, these mills have manufactured (<hi
                                        rend="italic">a</hi>) their quota of raw sugar in accordance
                                    with Decree-law 522 and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) their share
                                    of the sugar syrup quota. If we now refuse to allow them to
                                    manufacture the equivalent of 39,000 tons of raw sugar into
                                    syrup over and above their raw sugar quotas, these mills will be
                                    comparatively much harder hit by the curtailment of production
                                    than other mills.</item>

                            act. The failure of the Cuban Government to take action has already
                            largely vitiated the benefit in so far as the 1942 carryover is
                            concerned, that is, we have shipped at last year’s rates over half a
                            million tons and propose in any case not to move through other than
                            natural ports any large proportion of the balance. Moreover 1943 sugars

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my despatch No. 3653 of July
                            1, 1943<note n="93" xml:id="d157fn93">Not printed.</note> summarizing
                            certain agricultural proposals recently submitted by Minister of
                            Agriculture Martínez Saenz to the Junta Económica de Guerra,<note n="94"
                                xml:id="d157fn94">The Cuban equivalent of the United States Board of
                                Economic Warfare.</note> and in particular to Martínez Saenz’
                            proposed discriminatory treatment of administration cane,<note n="95"
                                xml:id="d157fn95">Cane grown on large estates owned by individuals
                                    (<hi rend="italic">hacendados</hi>) or corporations that also
                                controlled the means of converting that cane into sugar or its
                                byproducts.</note> (as well as to the Prime Minister’s general
                            endorsement of the eventual elimination of administration as an
                            objective), I have the honor to report that during a conversation with
                            Dr. Arturo Mañas yesterday he expressed the hope that the American
                            Government will see fit to include the protection of administration cane
                            as a point in any negotiations looking toward the purchase of 1944
                            sugar.</p>
                        <p>Mañas explained that the Martínez Saenz’ plan would in his opinion ruin
                            the United Fruit Company enterprise, and likewise dislocate production
                            at some of the General Sugar Estates mills (notably Central Vertientes).
                            The attack on administration cane, according to Mañas, is unjustified,
                            not only because the lands were acquired in good faith, and at fair
                            prices, but because estates such as those of the United Fruit Company
                            represent the most economical and efficient way of growing cane which
                            has yet been developed in Cuba. Furthermore, in view of our expressed
                            interest in seeing Cuban sugar costs reduced, <pb n="167"
                                xml:id="pg_167" facs="0181"/>administration cane should receive our
                            support on general economic grounds, as well as because of the American
                            interests involved.</p>
                        <p>Mañas went on to say that on the return to Cuba of Dr. Eamiro Guerra<note
                                n="96" xml:id="d157fn96">Ramiro Guerra y Sanchez, Deputy of the
                                Cuban Government attending the Inter-American Advisory Economic
                                Financial Committee meetings in Washington.</note> he proposes to
                            obtain the Cuban Government’s endorsement of an investigation and report
                            by Dr. Guerra on the large administration cane holdings. Guerra has the
                            general confidence of the industry, as well as of Amadeo López Castro,
                            and in Mañas’ opinion a report on the “real factors involved” should
                            tend to clarify the issues.</p>
                        <p>According to Mañas, López Castro, through his influence with the
                            President, is the key to the administration cane problem and that while
                            López Castro’s views concerning “social trends” remain somewhat
                            advanced, López Castro agrees with Mañas that an examination of the
                            problem should include consideration of “cañif undios”, that is, the
                            very extensive holdings of large <hi rend="italic">colonos</hi>, where
                            Mafias believes that general living conditions are markedly inferior to
                            those on administration cane lands of the large American companies.</p>
                        <p>It will be recalled that an expression of opinion with regard to
                            administration cane was made during the last sugar negotiations, but
                            that nothing definite came of it. I remain of the opinion that the
                            subject will constantly be agitated by Cuban officials, including those
                            who (like Aurelio Alvarez) are not exactly disinterested. I likewise
                            believe that the agitation against administration cane is generally
                            indicative of a social current which shows no sign of slacking, and
                            finally that the recent Martínez Saenz’ proposals, together with the
                            attitude of the Prime Minister in the matter of Central Tin-guaro
                            (please see despatch No. 3745 of July 8, 1943<note n="97"

                            indicate the extent of the earthquake which must affect the relations
                            between the Cuban Government and the sugar industry, before the latter
                            can be placed on the really low-cost-of-production basis that the Cuban
                            climate and soil should warrant.</p>

                        <p>462. López Castro, Casanova and Mañas broached the subject of sugar
                                negotiations<note n="98" xml:id="d158fn98">Negotiations on the 1944
                                crop.</note> to me last Saturday evening indicating that in their
                            opinion it would be desirable to hold such negotiations as soon as
                            possible thus giving stability to the local economic situation and if
                                <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0182"/>possible avoiding having
                            the size and price of the 1944 crop become a Cuban political football. I
                            consider their reasons valid.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Department’s telegram No. 712 of July 10, 6 p.m.”
                            (received subsequent to the discussion mentioned above) López Castro
                            called on me this morning. He stated on behalf of President Batista that
                            the latter is likewise of the opinion that the negotiations should be
                            undertaken at an early date and that the Cuban Government is prepared
                            either to send a mission to Washington or to receive a mission here
                            whichever our Government prefers. However, Batista desires the “official
                            initiative” to appear to come from us in the form of a note to the
                            Foreign Office. I see no objection to this procedure and suggest that I
                            be instructed accordingly.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my telephone
                            conversations with Mr. Scherer<note n="1" xml:id="d159fn1">George F.
                                Scherer of the Division of the American Republics.</note> on July 15
                            and 16, 1943 relative to the forthcoming sugar negotiations, I have the
                            honor to enclose for the confidential information of the Department a
                            copy of a memorandum<note n="99" xml:id="d159fn2">Not printed.</note> of
                            my conversation with Prime Minister Zaydín and Sr. López Castro on July
                            15, 1943. In this connection I also enclose a copy of my note<note
                                n="99" xml:id="d159fn3">Not printed.</note> to the Minister of
                                State<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn4">Emeterio Santovenia, who succeeded
                                José Martínez-Viademonte on March 6, 1943.</note> informing him that
                            our Government is agreeable to beginning negotiations in Washington on
                            July 26 next.</p>
                        <p>The Department will note that during my conversation with the Ministers
                            they expressed themselves as optimistic that an agreement can be reached
                            at an early date (which the Cuban Government obviously much desires),
                            and that I raised as a possible obstacle to the speedy conclusion of an
                            agreement the difficulties encountered this year with the loading of
                            vessels at Cuban ports.</p>
                        <p>The Cuban argument against the sale of sugar on a delivered-aboard-vessel
                            basis I do not find in the least convincing, and I wish to recommend
                            that serious consideration be given to the desirability of making our
                            purchase on that basis.</p>
                        <p>There is no single item in the 1943 operations which has caused anything
                            approaching the difficulty experienced in endeavoring to expedite the
                            efficient handling of ships at Cuban ports. This subject <pb n="169"
                                xml:id="pg_169" facs="0183"/>has been an almost daily matter of
                            discussion and argument between Ambassador Braden and me on the one
                            hand, and the Prime Minister, the Minister of Labor<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d159fn5">José Suárez Rivas.</note> and Sr. López Castro on
                            the other. It has no less occupied the attention of our War Shipping
                            Administration representatives in Habana, with Cuban Labor Department
                            officials, the Cuban Maritime Commission, labor leaders, terminal
                            operators, et cetera. The favorable results obtained with respect to
                            movement of sugar have in my opinion been due largely to these constant
                            efforts on the part of the Embassy, of ten against very tenacious
                            opposition from the Cubans. Furthermore, Cuban shipping charges are
                            exceedingly high, and in my opinion Cuban port workers are by no means
                            ill paid. While admittedly they went through a difficult period in the
                            latter part of 1942 and early 1943, and while at certain ports (notably
                            Cienfuegos) the laborers have shown a thoroughly patriotic attitude, it
                            should not be forgotten that Cuban port workers received a subsidy
                            during their idle period, and that the picture of abnegation and
                            patriotic self-sacrifice painted by the two Cabinet Ministers appears to
                            me to be somewhat overdrawn.</p>
                        <p>I am not unmindful of the fact that the Embassy’s present suggestion was
                            considered during the last negotiations, and opposed by War Shipping
                            Administration on the grounds that it might interfere with agency
                            arrangements for the handling of vessels, an argument the validity of
                            which I consider at least debatable.</p>
                        <p>As to the Ministers’ assertions concerning the difficulties between
                            maritime labor and the sugar interests, terminal operators, the
                            Government, et cetera, which they argue would follow adoption of my
                            suggestion, I do not believe these statements are indicative of anything
                            more than reluctance to modify the business-as-usual arrangements under
                            which the Cuban sugar industry is trying to operate. Furthermore, if the
                            maritime labor situation is as explosive as Zaydín maintains, that
                            should in my opinion be all the more reason for our Government to avoid
                            becoming involved (as we have had to become involved incessantly during
                            the past six months) in that situation.</p>
                        <p>To my mind there is no valid reason why the Cuban Government should not
                            itself (if it does not desire to have the matter handled by the
                            Institute) establish a fund into which would be paid the amount paid by
                            us, representing the cost of handling and placing aboard ship, and I
                            perceive no valid reason why, at a time when we are apparently pre-pared
                            to commit ourselves to purchase many millions of dollars worth of Cuban
                            sugar, thereby supporting the economy of the entire country, we should
                            not do so on terms which should greatly minimize our operational
                            problem.</p>
                        <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0184"/>
                        <p>I hope therefore that the Department will give renewed consideration to
                            this suggestion, which I may add is endorsed by the Habana
                            representatives of War Shipping Administration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Courtney</hi>: I was delighted to hear from
                            George Scherer of the successful start of the sugar negotiations. My
                            friend Dr. Guerra, with whom I talked on Monday afternoon, expressed
                            greatest satisfaction with the way in which things were going.</p>
                        <p>Larry<note n="5" xml:id="d160fn5">Laurence Duggan, Adviser on Political
                                Relations.</note> and I and the rest of us in the Department who
                            have been concerned with sugar matters, together with the Embassy in
                            Habana, would like to be of the greatest possible assistance to you in
                            your difficult and delicate task. I would suggest, therefore, that
                            before written proposals or memoranda are handed to the Cuban Delegation
                            the Department be given an opportunity to comment. With regard to the
                                memorandum<note n="6" xml:id="d160fn6">Not printed.</note> which I
                            understand was handed to the Cuban Commission yesterday, I have the
                            following observations: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>“<hi rend="italic">Bibijagua” Sugar</hi>. As you know, this is
                                    sugar produced by certain mills illegally. Generally the
                                    producing mills are near centers of consumption to which the
                                    sugar is rapidly and clandestinely moved to avoid local taxes.
                                    This type of sugar cannot move outside of Cuba. It seems to me
                                    neither practical nor desirable for us to ask the Cuban
                                    Government and the Sugar Institute for any commitments in this
                                    matter. They are just as interested as we are in restricting its
                                    production. It will not be possible for anyone to establish in a
                                    legal manner the production of this illegal sugar. Therefore, I
                                    propose that this question be approached through (<hi
                                        rend="italic">a</hi>) joint agreement as to the amount of
                                    sugar to be produced for local consumption and (<hi
                                        rend="italic">b</hi>) a definite limitation on the amount of
                                    excess local consumption which we will buy for export. I feel
                                    strongly that the approach suggested in the memorandum which was
                                    handed to the Cubans could be considered as a reflection upon
                                    the industry and as an undue interference in domestic Cuban
                                    affairs.</item>

                                <item><hi rend="italic">The Side of the Crop</hi>. I feel strongly
                                    that an endeavor should be made to fix the size of the crop
                                    finally and definitively prior to the beginning of the grinding
                                    season. For a variety of practical reasons, it would be
                                    unfortunate for uncertainty as to the ultimate size of the crop
                                    to prevail during the grinding season itself. Certainly we are
                                    not going to be able to make any exact adjustment <pb n="171"
                                        xml:id="pg_171" facs="0185"/>between production and shipping
                                    and I hope and believe that by January 1 you will be in a
                                    position to give a final figure confirming the preliminary
                                    figure at which I understand you now wish to arrive.</item>

                                <item><hi rend="italic">Storage</hi>. It is my own opinion,
                                    supported by the views of a number of sugar people with whom I
                                    have spoken, that storage facilities in Cuba can be adapted and
                                    additional facilities provided to take care of almost any
                                    foreseeable amount of sugar. Therefore, I suggest that in our
                                    discussions with the Cubans the size of the crop be related
                                    entirely to shipping facilities, with little or no emphasis on
                                    the question of storage except to establish appropriate
                                    responsibilities.</item>

                                    four of your memorandum you indicate the possibility that the
                                    grinding season may not have terminated by June 1. It is, in my
                                    judgment, highly unlikely that many mills, regardless of the
                                    size of the crop, will be able to grind after June 1.</item>

                                    should be brought out to the Cubans as emphatically and clearly
                                    as possible that we expect and require their cooperation in the

                                    of the industry as far as possible to other fuels, if we are to
                                    attain the relatively large sugar production which we are
                                    willing to underwrite.</item>

                        <p>Ambassador Braden feels strongly that it would be desirable to arrange
                            for the 1944 sugar to be delivered f.o.b. the vessel instead of f.a.s.,
                            as has been the case, as I understand it, in 1942 and 1943. I think that
                            this matter warrants a careful exploration with Ambassador Braden and I
                            suggest that, unless you have already done so, you discuss this with Mr.
                                Norregard.<note n="7" xml:id="d160fn7">Nelson Norregard, sugar

                            other words, I do not feel we should take War Shipping’s mere say so on
                            this without a careful investigation.</p>
                        <p>I was in the process of dictating the above when we had our telephone
                            conversation this morning. I do hope that you will find it possible to
                            emphasize to the Cubans that the memorandum handed to them yesterday is
                            not a considered expression of the official views of this Government,
                            but is rather to be considered, as you put it, an informal agenda to
                            serve as a basis for further discussion. It might be desirable to ask
                            the Cubans that, if they feel it necessary to send this memorandum to
                            Habana, they stress its informal, tentative and preliminary
                            character.</p>

                        <p>The Cuban Ambassador<note n="8" xml:id="d161fn8">Aurelio F.
                                Concheso.</note> telephoned me this morning and referred to the
                            conversation which he and López Castro had had with the Under Secretary
                            on Friday, August 13. I informed the Ambassador that Mr. Welles had been
                            absent from the Department since that date. I added that I myself was
                            familiar with the details of the current sugar negotiations and that I
                            would be glad to have a conversation with the Ambassador and López
                            Castro. An appointment was, consequently, made.</p>
                        <p>During the interview which ensued, the Ambassador said very little. López
                            Castro, after expressing very great appreciation at the way in which the
                            negotiations have been conducted by Commodity Credit, stated that there
                            were still two points unsettled. These he described as follows: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>The Cuban Commission believes that there should be retained in
                                    the 1944 contract the same provisions as in the 1943 contract
                                    with reference to Commodity’s obligation to move sugar at its
                                    expense, if necessary, to enable storage facilities to become
                                    available for the 1944 crop. As I understand it, this does not
                                    mean payment for normal movement but merely for abnormal shifts
                                    of sugar to take advantage of warehousing facilities. López
                                    Castro expressed himself with great eloquence on this subject.
                                    He said that the failure to retain this clause would mean that
                                    the Cuban producers would be confronted with an uncertainty and
                                    would be placed in a disadvantageous position owing to the fact
                                    that Commodity determines shipping and port allocations without
                                    consulting the Institute. López Castro concluded that a failure
                                    on the part of Commodity to include this clause in the new
                                    contract meant in effect a closing of the door so far as he was
                                    concerned.</item>

                                <item>López Castro insisted that from the Cuban point of view the
                                    escalator clause should be retained in the 1944 contract
                                    omitting the twenty-two points mentioned in the 1943
                                        contract.<note n="9" xml:id="d161fn9">Not printed.</note>
                                    These points, in accordance with the 1943 provision, would not
                                    go to the Cuban producers in the event of an increase in the
                                    ceiling price of sugar. López Castro stressed that it would be
                                    politically and morally impossible for a situation to develop in
                                    which circumstances justify an increase in the ceiling price of
                                    sugar and the Cuban producers were debarred by this provision
                                    from participating in such an increase. I told López Castro that
                                    it seemed to me that the matter was of a rather theoretical
                                    nature in view of the determination of the agencies of this
                                    Government to hold the line on prices. López Castro replied that
                                    he agreed but that he felt that the Cuban position nevertheless
                                    should be protected. He then made the proposal that the first 44
                                        <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0187"/>points of any
                                    increase in the ceiling might be divided equally between the
                                    Cuban producers and Commodity. Thus, in the event of a 44 point
                                    rise in the ceiling, Commodity would recuperate the 22 points
                                    mentioned in the 1943 contract.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>By the time he had finished setting forth these two points, López Castro
                            was in a relatively high state of emotion. Both he and the Ambassador
                            asked me, on the basis of the State Department’s knowledge of Cuban
                            conditions and so forth, to do my best to secure favorable action on
                            these two points.</p>
                        <p>Following their departure, I telephoned Mr. Courtney Brown. I told him
                            that, in my judgment, López Castro and the Cubans had handled themselves
                            extremely well in this whole negotiation. I stated that the acceptance
                            by them of a 2.65 price represented a breadth of understanding and
                            statesmanship which I hoped we all appreciated. I then added that on the
                            two points which López Castro had described to me, I hoped that a
                            favorable decision might be reached. I said that the warehousing clause
                            had already been included in the 1943 contract and that I felt that it
                            was impossible for the Cubans to accept anything less favorable in 1944.
                            I pointed out that this clause would be operated on the basis of
                            consultation and cooperation between Commodity and the Institute. It
                            would definitely not be at the whim of the individual mill owners, so
                            far as expense to Commodity is concerned. With regard to the escalator
                            clause, I gave it as my own view that a clause eliminating all mention
                            of the 22 points would be desirable. In other words, I went further than
                            López Castro’s latest proposal. However, I did describe this proposal to
                            Mr. Brown, who seemed favorably impressed. (Later the Cuban Ambassador
                            telephoned to say that, in the event that López Castro’s proposal
                            appeared satisfactory from our point of view, it would be highly
                            desirable from the tactical angle for it to be presented as a United
                            States proposal. López Castro apparently believes that it will be
                            acceptable to the Cubans, if presented by us.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Brown outlined the difficulties which he had been encountering in
                            accepting the Cuban point of view on these matters. He said, however,
                            that he would continue to work on his colleagues, including Mr.
                                Hutson.<note n="10" xml:id="d161fn10">J. B. Hutson, president of the

                                Purchase Contract,” and was initialed by representatives of the
                                Cuban Sugar Commission and of the Commodity Credit Corporation. It
                                stipulated that the 1944 Cuban crop purchase agreement would follow
                                the provisions of the 1943 Cuban Crop Purchase Agreement, subject to
                                certain alterations involving (1) size of crop and quantity of sugar

                                Cuban Sugar Stabilization Institute. By the terms of this agreement,
                                Commodity Credit Corporation contracted to purchase a minimum of

                        <p>It took just three hours for the meeting of September 27 to arrive at a
                            statement; with the Cubans unable to accept the following proposal of
                            the United States group, presented by Mr. Sabin: <list>

                                <item>One contract to include both invert and blackstrap molasses.
                                    The United States is willing to take the exportable surplus of
                                    both 1943 and 1944 blackstrap molasses, estimated at a total of
                                    about 100,000,000 gallons.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>Invert molasses to be sold on the basis of 2.40¢ per pound of
                                    sugar, with a minimum quantity of 100,000,000 and maximum of
                                    280,000,000 gallons. The quantity is to come out of the sugar
                                    crop as purchased by CCC, although no guarantee can be given
                                    that the increase over 70,000,000 gallons will mean an increase
                                    in the size of the crop, as that is CCC’s decision.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>

                        <p>Before reaching its final proposal, the United States Commission reviewed
                            subsidies and cost figures on invert and blackstrap molasses <pb n="177"
                                xml:id="pg_177" facs="0191"/>and López Castro expounded on
                            Cuban-American economic relations, dwelling at some length on the trade
                            agreement. He mentioned that the Dominican Republic will receive a price
                            of 2.65 for sugar although it has no trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Cuban Commission clearly indicated that they could not sell invert at
                            less than 2.50 and that they would have to repeat all their previous
                            arguments concerning the need for selling blackstrap on a sugar content
                            basis in reply to a United States proposal.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: It appeared likely that the Cuban
                            Commission has been negotiating on the same basis as it negotiated
                            sugar, that is no less favorable provisions than the 1942 molasses
                            contract are acceptable. They mentioned at the last meeting and for the
                            first time that they have no authority to negotiate a blackstrap price,
                            as they must submit the matter to the Institute and sugar associations
                            in Cuba. They have authority to agree on invert, since it is sugar for
                            all intents and purposes and the Commission’s activities, of course,
                            relate directly to sugar.</p>

                            Government to increase above those existing on July l, 1943 the
                            stevedoring, loading and port wages, and other charges in connection
                            with the loading of sugar at ports, unless the export price of sugar for
                            Cuba increases. Should any increase in such export price for Cuban sugar

                            industry be made as a consequence thereof, stevedoring, loading and port
                            wages may be increased in a proportion not to exceed the proportion of

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my
                            Note No. 343 of April 3, 1943 relative to the possible accrual of a net
                            profit to the Government of the United States of America as a result of
                            the 1943 Sugar Purchase Contract. I also refer to Article Eighteen of
                            the 1944 Cuban Sugar Crop Purchase and Sale Contract, the provisions of
                            which apply to the determination of a net profit if any, resulting from
                            the 1944 sugar crop purchase.</p>
                        <p>Taking into consideration the Article under reference, my Government
                            reasserts its readiness to join in consultation with Your Excellency’s
                            Government concerning the distribution, for the benefit of Cuba, of any
                            eventual net profit that may be disclosed. My Government has not
                            undertaken the 1944 sugar crop purchase contract for the purpose of
                            making a net profit, nor does it propose that any of its agencies shall
                            profit thereby. In determining whether a net profit has been realized,
                            the loss, if any, incurred by Commodity Credit Corporation under the
                            purchase agreement on 1943 Cuban sugar crop is to be taken into
                            consideration among other items.</p>

                                    Habana has been most carefully considered, the interested
                                    agencies of this Government are hopeful that it may be possible
                                    for the Cuban Delegation to return to Washington for this
                                    purpose. In this connection, the scope of the various problems
                                    under discussion and the number of United States Governmental
                                    agencies involved appear to make it more practicable for

                                    every effort to secure a favorable decision in this

                            disposed to purchase 100,000 tons of Cuban refined sugar—40,000 for the
                            Pepsi Cola Company and 60,000 for the Mexican Sugar Institute—and to
                            furnish Cuba in return with all the gas oil required for its

                            of an additional 100,000 tons of sugar and the earmarking of 40,000 tons
                            thereof for a private concern; and as, in line with basic pool
                            principles, any gas oil imported from Mexico would <pb n="182"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Acheson</hi>: On December 20 in Washington
                            representatives of the Cuban Government, sugar and alcohol industries,
                            will renew discussions involving the possible purchase by this
                            Government of blackstrap and invert molasses and industrial alcohol.
                            Previous conversations were interrupted in late September, when the
                            Cuban group indicated it was unable to accept Defense Supplies
                            Corporation’s proposal on invert and backstrap molasses.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Blackstrap Molasses</hi></p>
                        <p>Since September, War Production Board has become increasingly concerned
                            at the sky-rocketing diversion into beverage alcohol of Caribbean
                            molasses urgently needed in the United Nations alcohol program. With the
                            enormous expansion in Cuban alcohol producing facilities it is likely
                            that no Cuban blackstrap molasses will be available to the war program
                            next year if the current negotiations are unsuccessful.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Invert Molasses</hi></p>
                        <p>WPB’s present interest is to obtain as much invert molasses as it can in
                            agreement with the food agencies of this Government and with the Cuban
                            Government. The provisions of the 1944 Cuban Sugar Contract call for
                            agreement between Commodity Credit Corporation and the Cuban Sugar
                            Institute as to the total size of the Cuban crop and for agreement as to
                            the amount of sugar to be released from the contract for the production
                            of invert molasses.</p>
                        <p>Agencies of this Government have agreed on the equivalent of 800,000
                            short tons of sugar in invert, but the Cubans may not be willing to
                            produce much more than 600,000 tons as invert. Agriculture has estimated
                            the 1944 Cuban crop at 4,850,000 short tons to be distributed as

                        <p>This Government proposes to purchase Cuban specification industrial
                            alcohol at a price related to blackstrap. While no official figures are
                            available as to Cuba’s possible production, private sources estimate
                            output of 190 proof alcohol as high as 80 to 90 million gallons
                            annually. For alcohol not meeting specifications an adjusted price may
                            be paid.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Beverage Import Control</hi></p>
                        <p>In May this year the Embassy at Habana suggested the advisability of
                            establishing control of alcohol imports under War Production Order M–63
                            in order to safeguard for Cuba its supply of cooking and motor vehicle
                            fuel in the face of increasing beverage alcohol exports WPB did not
                            consider itself involved at that time, since the tanker shortage made it
                            impossible to move much molasses. Subsequently, shipping eased, and WPB
                            finds its much needed raw material diverted into non-essential use. It
                            has been unable to agree to definitive import control although it
                            indicates that it would be willing to use such control as a last resort
                            and if the negotiations are about to break down. The level at which
                            imports would be fixed has not been decided.</p>
                        <p>The Department has maintained throughout the numerous discussions that we
                            should inform the interested Governments including Cuba, Mexico and so
                            on, in advance of the establishment of import control.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Numerous U. S. Agencies
                            Involved</hi></p>
                        <p>The variety of United States agencies interested in the matter has not
                            made it easy to deal effectively with the Cubans. Commodity Credit
                            Corporation, as purchaser of sugar; War Production Board, directing
                            Foreign Economic Administration to procure certain quantities of
                            molasses; and Defense Supplies Corporation as previous molasses
                            purchaser, are all actively interested. It has been my feeling for some
                            time that the purchase of molasses and sugar might very effectively be
                            centered in one agency.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Crowley has decided that the American negotiating group will be
                            headed by Mr. Sidney Scheuer, Director, Foreign Procurement and
                            Development Branch, FEA.</p>
                        <p>In an effort to emphasize the importance of the molasses and alcohol
                            programs, the Secretary discussed the matter with Dr. Concheso, Cuban
                            Ambassador at Washington. The Secretary spoke of the tremendous
                            diversion of an essential raw material into non-essential channels,
                            stressing the need for both Governments to face firmly the efforts and
                            pressure of the private, powerful alcohol interests.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Scherer</hi>: Reference is made to Habana
                            cable #806 dated December 6 concerning a proposal of the Mexican
                            Government in conjunction with the Pepsi Cola Company to purchase
                            100,000 tons of Cuban refined sugar.</p>
                        <p>It is the consensus in Agriculture that no such proposal should be given
                            favorable consideration.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, the prospective Caribbean supply of sugar is
                            approximately 500,000 short tons below requirements upon this area as a
                            source. The United States has commitments to furnish 700,000 tons of
                            sugar to North and West Africa and Russia under lend-lease and to
                            certain other United Nations and friendly neutrals besides a large
                            military and civilian ration demand. Also the equivalent of 1,000,000
                            tons of Caribbean sugar probably will be required for the production of
                            industrial alcohol, and 1,120,000 tons are needed to fill British and
                            Canadian requirements. It is also important that stocks in the Caribbean
                            as of the end of 1944 be maintained at a level that will provide
                            sufficient sugars to maintain the shipping schedule in early 1945, and
                            to forestall the development of a shortage situation when the United
                            States bargains for the 1945 crops.</p>
                        <p>In the second place, Mexico has not taken any definitive steps to curtail
                            the consumption of sugar, as have the United States, the United Kingdom,
                            Canada, Russia and French North and West Africa. On the contrary,
                            consumption of sugar in Mexico has been rising sharply during the war
                            years as a result of increasing purchasing power, whereas in all of the
                            other countries mentioned above, consumption has been reduced to levels
                            considerably below normal. In this connection it is noted that a part of
                            the proposed import from Cuba is for the Pepsi Cola Company and is for
                            the purpose of producing unra-tioned flavoring syrups for export to the
                            United States. It is the consensus in Agriculture that the import of
                            these syrups into the United States should be restricted and that the
                            sugar value should be chargeable to the importer’s sugar ration. It is
                            not unlikely that this action will be taken in the near future, in which
                            case the Pepsi Cola Company would not require the sugar in Mexico.</p>
                        <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0199"/>
                        <p>Finally, it should be pointed out that Mexico is just starting to harvest
                            a new crop of sugar cane and there is no likelihood of a sugar shortage
                            developing there during the next 9 months. Reports have been received
                            that the new cane crop has suffered damage from hurricanes and flood,
                            but no accurate appraisal of the extent of the damage can be made until
                            after harvest is complete. It is suggested, therefore, that no further
                            consideration be given to the question of Mexico’s import needs until
                            sometime next summer when a clearer picture of the supply and
                            requirements situation will be available.<note n="35" xml:id="d171fn35"

                            situation may develop in which our attitude is misinterpreted to the
                            benefit of certain interested persons in Habana. I am bringing
                            informally to the attention of the Prime Minister<note n="39"

                            with respect to alleged plans for splitting commissions in certain

                            well as to reports that those allegedly promoting the deal are saying
                            that “the American Government wants it done that way”. I shall also
                            point out that notwithstanding the fact that the cost of the insurance
                            is to be borne by producers, with the American Government investing
                            upwards of $150,000,000 in this crop, we can legitimately insist that
                            responsible American brokers be not excluded from bidding for the

                            that the Embassy is not in a position to deal with the questionable
                            phase of this matter in a practical way, and consequently the more it
                            intervenes the greater is the possibility of it receiving some of the
                            eventual blame.</p>

                            resulted from pressure applied by the President<note n="49"

                            discussions with all the persons involved and interested. But a definite
                            decision on the acceptability of the Godoy plan should not be further
                            deferred, and in particular because of the afore-mentioned approval
                            given by the Congressional Committee it might have an unfavorable effect
                            were we only a few days before June 1 to announce that we did not

                            that the technical aspects of the insurance deal are the only ones for
                            consideration it seems apparent from telegram number 601 that those
                            aspects leave very much to be desired.</p>
                        <p>I am informed that the reinsurance is assigned to the Institute in order
                            to protect it in the case of the bankruptcy of the Rhode Island or the
                                Metropolitan.<note n="54" xml:id="d178fn54">The Rhode Island

                            informed that the reinsurance is with Lloyds and may be canceled at any

                        <p>I do not understand the “absence of satisfactory alternative” referred to
                            in telegram No. 600 since it is apparent that if we reject the Godoy
                            deal the Institute will certainly produce alternate insurance proposals
                            and if these should prove unsatisfactory we could offer to insure the
                            sugar ourselves (of course at the expense of the Cuban producers).</p>

                            to be known as the “Godoy Proposal”. Mr. Braden has, for example, stated
                            that “reports of corruption … have … become … so notorious … that I have
                            reached the conclusion that even if the insurance appears secure …<note

                        <p>Mr. Bonsal, Mr. Scherer and I examined this message carefully and
                            concluded that, if the proposal were to be refused, it should be
                            properly refused by the Commodity Credit, under the terms of its
                            contract with the Institute, on technical grounds and not on allegations
                            of corruption nor for policy reasons, for which the Department would
                            have to take the responsibility. Mr. Bonsal sent a message reading as
                                follows:<note n="61" xml:id="d179fn61">Text of Department’s telegram

                        <p>The CCC and representatives of the Institute were in almost continuous
                            session this week. The CCC called in an insurance specialist for
                            consultation. Certain questions arose on which the CCC desired
                            additional security and assurances, primarily with regard to the
                            reinsurance of the insurance written by one American company and four
                            Cubans. The CCC is now satisfied with the reinsurance contracts, which
                            have been passed upon as well by the insurance specialists, and have
                            informed the Institute’s representatives that the insurance contracts
                            are acceptable and that, therefore, sugar payments will be made June 1
                            in accordance with the Sugar Crop Purchase Contract.</p>

                        <p>626. The Commodity Credit Corporation has made a most careful study of
                            the insurance contracts, in connection with which they have been in
                            almost continuous session for the past few days, with Rasco,<note n="65"

                            principal issue has been the reinsurance in connection especially with
                            the policies of the Rhode Island Insurance Company and four Cuban
                            companies.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the Commodity Credit Corporation have in this
                            regard obtained from the Institute’s representatives, through
                            negotiation, certain readjustments and additional commitments which from
                            the technical aspects are satisfactory to the Commodity Credit
                            Corporation.</p>
                        <p>Thus the Commodity Credit Corporation has concluded that the coverage is
                            satisfactory and it will according to the contract be able to effect 90
                            per cent payments on June 1.</p>

                            followed the discussions with your opinions of the transaction fully in
                            mind. The Department did not see fit to urge the CCC as purchaser of the
                            sugar to inject into its examination of the contracts and in its
                            conversations with the Cubans any other considerations than the proper
                            technical ones. (It might be mentioned that the Commodity Credit
                            Corporation would also be loathe to place the Institute, whose
                            collaboration in the coming months for the fulfilment of the sugar
                            purchase contract is essential, in the extremely embarrassing position
                            vis-à-vis the industry in which refusal to accept the insurance
                            contracts would have placed it.)</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Ambassador</hi>: All of us who are
                            interested in Cuba (and there are many) have given our very best thought
                            to the sugar insurance problem on which you have sent a number of
                            interesting, helpful and informative messages.</p>
                        <p>Knowing how very interested you and Ellis<note n="67" xml:id="d181fn67"
                                >Ellis O. Briggs.</note> have been in this transaction, I should
                            like to give you a summary of the developments and of the factors which
                            have guided the action here.</p>
                        <p>Discussions have been held within the Department among such Cuban experts
                            (and near experts) as Larry, Phil, George<note n="68" xml:id="d181fn68"
                                >Laurence Duggan, Philip Bonsal; and George Scherer.</note> and me;
                            and the pros and cons were even carried to the highest quarters.</p>
                        <p>In all of the discussions, both intragovernmental and with the Cubans,
                            which have been held in the CCC, we have had a representative present,
                            to express your views and those of the Department, and to keep us
                            informed.</p>
                        <p>The CCC, throughout its examination of the insurance and reinsurance
                            contracts, had the benefit of the assistance and advice of a Department
                            of Agriculture insurance expert.</p>
                        <p>Frankly, we did not feel that we could muster sufficient substantiated
                            evidence of a political nature which would justify asking the CCC, which
                            was entirely satisfied with the risk on technical grounds to refuse
                            acceptance of the contracts. One of the results of disapproval on
                            unsubstantiated political grounds may well have been accusations against
                            this Government and probably especially against the State Department
                            that this was a successful maneuver on the part of other groups of
                            less-favored insurance companies.…</p>
                        <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0207"/>
                        <p>We have made a few inquiries among sugar people with regard to the
                            practice of splitting commissions and have been uniformly told that this
                            practice is traditional and unquestioned (regardless of its merits) in
                            the sugar industry in Cuba. We have also made inquiries as to the degree
                            of commission splitting and have been uniformly told that the amounts
                            split this year are not out of line with split commissions in previous
                            years (always in relation, of course, to the proportions of the
                            transaction).</p>
                        <p>In substance, then, it appears that neither the practice of commission
                            splitting nor the degree has been very different this year than in
                            previous years.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, the CCC feels confident that the reduction in rates which
                            has now been effected would work to the advantage of this Government
                            when the CCC assumes title to and responsibility for the remaining ‘43
                            sugars.</p>

                            arrangement had been presented to CCC with the approval of the Institute
                            and the Cuban Senate, it strikes me that the Department or CCC might
                            well call to the attention of the Cuban Delegation the desirability of
                            providing an equal opportunity for the various underwriters legally
                            doing business in Cuba to contract for the 1944 insurance. May I please
                            have your views?</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Bonsal</hi>: Prior to the 1943 crop, the
                            bulk of the Cuban sugar warehouse insurance was handled through the New
                            York insurance brokerage firm of Johnson &amp; Higgins. As you know, the
                            1943 insurance was placed by the Institute through Enrique Godoy in
                            Havana.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Louis Tofte of the firm of Johnson &amp; Higgins called on me
                            yesterday and stated that the insurance companies, which are among the
                            most responsible in the United States, that handled the insurance prior
                            to 1943 are prepared to reduce their rates in an effort to recover the
                            business. The companies that Mr. Godoy placed the insurance with were
                            not sufficiently large to handle the coverage alone and it was necessary
                            to have extensive reinsurance in order to afford the necessary
                            protection. We hope that the 1944 insurance can be spread so that it
                            will be placed with responsible companies with a very limited amount of
                            reinsurance.</p>
                        <p>For that reason we are glad to hear that Mr. Tofte’s group is prepared to
                            reenter the market. He stated that he is sure that the rate they will
                            quote will be low enough to get the business but is afraid that other
                            considerations will influence the decision of the Institute. He feels
                            that if the Institute would agree to ask for sealed bids and open such
                            bids in a manner that would insure the lowest bidder receiving the
                            business, the situation would work out satisfactorily. If sealed bids
                            are not required, he is of the opinion that whatever he quotes will be
                            shopped around by competitors and the entire insurance picture will
                            again become confused.</p>
                        <p>Commodity Credit Corporation is particularly anxious for a greater
                            spreading of insurance because of the larger crop in 1944 and the
                            greater amount of money involved in the advances to be made by Commodity
                            to the producers. The suggestion of sealed bids appeals to us and we
                            would appreciate anything Mr. Braden can do to further the program,
                            providing it meets with his approval.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Tofte will be in Havana in the very near future and we are suggesting
                            to him that he call upon Mr. Braden prior to discussing the insurance
                            problem with any other parties in Havana.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to previous
                            correspondence concerning the insurance scandal relative to the 1943
                            Cuban sugar crop and to the opinion which I have expressed on various
                            occasions that unless the Institute takes a strong stand in the matter a
                            similar unsavory deal is likely to be attempted (and consummated) with
                            respect to the much larger 1944 crop.</p>
                        <p>I consider that the only sound procedure in the premises will be for the
                            Institute to call for bids for the 1944 insurance, with the
                            understanding that should there appear to be collusion among the
                            underwriters and unsatisfactory bids submitted, the whole subject be
                            aired and a new call for bids made. Should this be done, I have no
                            reason to doubt that responsible companies will make offers combining
                            reasonable rates with maximum security.</p>
                        <p>In order to sound out the situation I have taken up this question
                            informally with several of the leading American <hi rend="italic"
                                >hacendados</hi>,<note n="72" xml:id="d184fn72">Sugar mill
                                owners.</note> having in mind that in the first instance the
                            Hacendados Association<note n="73" xml:id="d184fn73">National

                            promoting through its members in the Institute full discussion of the
                            matter, with a view to Institute endorsement of competitive bidding.
                            Insofar as I have been able to determine thus far, all of the American
                                <hi rend="italic">hacendados</hi> favor competitive bidding with the
                            possible exception of Mr. Philip Rosenberg of the General Sugar Estates

                            years ago with the result that he contracted for insurance on the 1942
                            and 1943, crops through the Rhode Island Insurance Company (represented
                            in Habana by Enrique Godoy). I have not yet discussed the matter with
                            Mr. Rosenberg, although I intend to do so. Other American <hi

                            of the 1943 insurance and in deploring the way in which it inevitably
                            damaged the prestige and standing of the Institute.</p>
                        <p>I have good reason to believe that, although eight months ago he loudly
                            condemned the Godoy deal as “un atraco”<note n="75" xml:id="d184fn75">“A

                            be desirable to bear the fore-going in mind.</p>
                        <p>While I appreciate that at this juncture the question of insurance on the
                            1944 crop is not a matter in which our Government has any official say,
                            nevertheless the insurance eventually “shall be subject to acceptance by
                            Commodity and the Institute…”<note n="78" xml:id="d184fn78">Omission

                            the 1944 contract.<note n="79" xml:id="d184fn79">Not printed.</note> I
                            wish therefore to reiterate the view which I have earnestly expressed on
                            previous occasions, namely that the good name of our Government was not
                            enhanced by our acceptance of the 1943 crop deal, the corruption
                            involved in which was a matter of widespread public knowledge in Cuba
                            and likewise in sugar and insurance circles in the United States. It was
                            a source of deep regret to me that the Department did not see fit to
                            support my recommendations in this matter, and my purpose in raising the
                            issue again, at this time, is that unless we cease to be acquiescent in
                            this particular, I should expect last year’s arrangement with its
                            attendant graft to be duplicated when the time comes to insure the 1944
                            crop.</p>

                            appears that all agents have been circularized by the Institute which
                            indicated that Enrique Godoy would be the broker. Certain agents have
                            informed the institute that they will take part in the underwriting only
                            through their customary brokers. Mr. Wilson regards this as a favorable
                            development, since it shows that the insurance matter is now “in the
                            open” and the Institute is likely to act more circumspectly than
                            before.</p>
                        <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0211"/>
                        <p>Mr. Wilson pointed out again to Dr. Mañas, as lie did in August, the
                            importance of satisfactory insurance. He stated that CCC will not accept
                            the large amount of reinsurance that accompanied the 1943 contract, nor
                            will CCC permit any single company to carry more than 7% of the total
                            insurance involved.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wilson feels that CCC’s position has been presented emphatically and
                            frequently enough to make it impossible for the Cubans later to claim a

                            portions of a report<note n="83" xml:id="d186fn85">Not printed.</note>
                            by the Office of the Legal Attaché of this Embassy, giving details
                            regarding the destroyed factory.</p>
                        <p>This report states that the fire which destroyed the Tinguaro Sugar Mill,
                            which is owned by the American firm, Cuban-American Sugar Company,
                            started about 4 a.m. January 20, 1943, probably from a short circuit in
                            the electrical wiring system, and except for the packing room and the
                            centrifugal room, the plant is a total loss. At the time of the fire the
                            factory was being repaired and put into operating condition in
                            preparation for the coming grinding season. The estimated loss due to
                            the fire is placed at $1,500,000.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Joseph B. Harris, General Manager of the Cuban-American Sugar
                            Company, stated that he did not believe the fire was caused by a
                            saboteur as it would have been very difficult for an outsider to enter
                            the plant due to careful guarding of the place, and workers of the plant
                            would be unlikely to damage it since they would only be depriving
                            themselves of employment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Harris stated that the factory employed about 200 workers during the
                            sugar harvest season; that the daily capacity of the mill was 2,300
                            sacks; and that the estimated production for the current season was to
                            have been 170,000 sacks.</p>

                                reprinted.</note> from the local vernacular newspaper, <hi
                                rend="italic">El Mundo</hi>, of today’s date giving an account of
                            the fire and its effect on the coming sugar crop. It will be noted that
                            according to this account, the damage was not so extensive as at first
                            reported, and that it was possible the mill could be repaired and
                            operations started in about forty-five days. The newspaper also states
                            that the damage probably will not exceed $150,000, and that the number
                            of workers affected by the holocaust totaled about 600. These figures
                            are in direct variance with those given by Mr. Harris. The article
                            stresses the fact that there had been no disagreement between the
                            company and the employees. Most of the remaining facts cited in the

                            would take over the Tinguaro property and reconstruct the mill thereon.
                            It will be recalled that this mill belongs to the Cuban-American Sugar
                            Mills Company and was approximately 50% destroyed by fire several weeks

                            of the company, arrived in Habana about the middle of January and had a
                            meeting with the Prime Minister on February 5. At this gathering, which
                            was also attended by the company’s attorney, Dr. Arturo Mañas, the Prime
                            Minister strongly urged that the company reconstruct the mill in order
                            to give employment to the workers therein. Mr. Kaiser stated his belief
                            that his directors would be unwilling to do this unless they were
                            assured by the Cuban Government that this property, which he claims has
                            been unprofitable, could be placed on a basis where it could operate
                            without loss, and to this end he demanded as a <pb n="199"

                            his company’s carrying out its reconstruction that the government assign
                            an additional quota to the property and obtain a reduction in railroad
                            freight rates for it. The Minister replied that he would favorably
                            consider such action once the mill had been reconstructed by the
                            company, but that unless this work were commenced forthwith the
                            government would be compelled to intervene, take over the property,
                            operate it for a period and reconstruct the mill itself for the
                            company’s account.</p>

                            ordered him to intervene in the mill immediately, and to this end a
                            decree was being drafted. The Prime Minister also expressed great
                            annoyance because despite Mr. Kaiser’s promise to consult with his Board
                            of Directors in New York, a week had passed and Mr. Kaiser had not even
                            left Habana.</p>
                        <p>The following day Mr. Kaiser called on me, and I expressed my regret that
                            he had not done so before since probably my good offices might have been
                            more effective if I had been consulted before matters had reached such
                            an impasse with the Prime Minister. However I was able to induce the
                            Prime Minister to defer any action until a more thorough discussion had
                            been had.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly on February 15 I attended a meeting at the Prime Minister’s
                            office at which in addition to Dr. Zaydín and myself there were present
                            Minister of the Presidency Lόpez Castro, Mr. Kaiser and Dr. Mañas.<note
                                n="92" xml:id="d187fn92">Arturo M. Mañas, consulting lawyer.</note>
                            The Prime Minister still demanded that the company agree forthwith to
                            reconstruct the mill and said that otherwise the decree which he held in
                            his hand would be issued immediately giving effect to the government’s
                            intervention. Mr. Kaiser refused to commit himself but indicated that
                            his directors would consider it a better course for the company to
                            collect approximately $400,000 of insurance covering the loss by the
                            fire, to have its cane ground in other mills in the vicinity and not
                            reconstruct a plant which had been a losing venture for fifteen to
                            twenty years with the sole exception of 1942.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out to Mr. Kaiser that the government was faced with a
                            difficult social and political problem, that neither the State
                            Department nor this Embassy could do more than exercise good offices
                            unless it should be established at some time that there had been a
                            denial of justice<note n="93" xml:id="d187fn93">For explanation of this

                            and that this might be difficult to do since the Cuban Constitution
                            provides that inherent in property rights are social obligations. I also
                            pointed out that intervention in this property might have repercussions
                            on his company’s four other centrals<note n="94" xml:id="d187fn94">Sugar

                            general. I said that to avoid all of the <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200"
                                facs="0214"/>disagreeableness, including the possible criminal suits
                            alleging arson in the case of the fire, that I felt the company should
                            be willing to make some effort to ease the Prime Minister’s problem and
                            that this, I thought, might be done if the company would agree, pending
                            its reaching a decision with respect to reconstruction, to pay normal
                            wages to its employees who had been deprived of work by the fire.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand I explained to the Minister that in view of our
                            stringent laws I felt Mr. Kaiser was entirely accurate in his allegation
                            that he could not take any action without the prior approval of his
                            Board, I explained Mr. Kaiser’s delays as misunderstandings. I expressed
                            the hope that the Minister’s problem from the social and political
                            aspects might be temporarily assuaged through the payment of wages I had
                            suggested to Mr. Kaiser.</p>
                        <p>It required several hours to accommodate the differing viewpoints of the
                            Prime Minister and Mr. Kaiser, but I am now glad to enclose copy of Acta
                            dated February 16<note n="95" xml:id="d187fn95">Not printed; it was a
                                formal memorandum of a conversation that took place on February 16
                                between Zaydín, Lόpez Castro, Keiser, and Mañas in which the Cubans
                                presented a 9–point statement of their idea of the Company’s
                                obligations to its workers and in which Keiser explained that
                                company action must await decisions of the Board of Directors in New
                                York.</note> from which it will be noted that the intervention in
                            the mill has been deferred and that Mr. Kaiser has through February 23
                            in which to advise whether or not the company will pay its mill workers
                            the normal wages they might have expected this season. In any event
                            these wages will be paid through February 23, and the company will have
                            until March 9 to determine whether it will or will not reconstruct. If
                            it should decide not to reconstruct then the government may intervene,
                            but will not take over company revenues unless the company is
                            relinquished from the obligation to pay wages.</p>
                        <p>That even this temporary solution has eased the situation is indicated by
                            the following telegram which has just been received: <quote

                        <p>I sincerely hope that the company Board of Directors will decide to
                            reconstruct the mill, particularly as the Prime Minister has promised
                            Mr. Kaiser in Dr. Mañas’ and my presence that the government will do its
                            utmost to improve his corporation’s earnings. While there is no question
                            that there are too many sugar mills operating on this island, it is also
                            true that through the years communities have been built up around the
                            centrals so that their sudden cessation, as in the present instance,
                            would entail severe hardship on the workers, and undoubtedly a social
                            obligation does devolve on these sugar companies.</p>

                            relative to Central Tinguaro of the Cuban American Sugar Company, and to
                            report that Mr. David Keiser called at the Embassy yesterday and
                            informed me that it is not the intention of his Company to rebuild the
                            mill.</p>
                        <p>For reasons with which the Department is already familiar, the Company
                            concludes that it would be uneconomic to reconstruct Tinguaro, which
                            operated for nineteen out of the last twenty years at a loss, and Mr.
                            Keiser is now negotiating with Mr. Edward G. Miller, head of the
                            Compañia Azucarera Atlántica del Golfo, for the sale of the property
                            with the understanding that the cane quotas would be transferred to one
                            or another of the Atlántica mills in the vicinity, and that the Tinguaro
                            mill itself would not be rebuilt. No agreement between the companies has
                            yet been reached, but Mr. Keiser characterized the negotiations as
                            “promising.” (I have received similar information from Mr. Crosby of
                            Atlántica.)</p>
                        <p>I pointed out to Mr. Keiser that the decision not to rebuild is directly
                            counter to the announced intentions of the Prime Minister, and moreover
                            that Dr. Zaydín has expressed himself recently as somewhat irritated
                            over Mr. Keiser’s failure to abide by the terms of the Acta of February
                            16 last<note n="98" xml:id="d188fn98">See footnote 95, <ref
                                    target="#pg_200">p. 200</ref>.</note> (please see despatch No.
                            2260 of February 19, 1943), under which Mr. Keiser had agreed to inform
                            the Prime Minister of the intentions of his Company within a period of
                            three weeks. A further ingredient of the Prime Minister’s annoyance is
                            the altercation over the number of days’ pay to which the workers are
                            entitled under the Acta, it being Dr. Zaydín’s contention that had the
                            mill operated, the <hi rend="italic">zafra</hi><note n="99"
                                xml:id="d188fn99">Supply of cane.</note> would have lasted
                            approximately 50 days, whereas Mr. Keiser has thus far declined to pay
                            the wages of the <hi rend="italic">batey</hi> workers,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d188fn1">Mill hands.</note> 368 in number, for more than 41
                            days. (Dr. Mañas in a private conversation was somewhat critical of
                            Keiser for not adopting a more conciliatory attitude on this point.)</p>
                        <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0216"/>
                        <p>Mr. Keiser went on to say that the Prime Minister had visited Tinguaro in
                            company with Sr. Lόpez Castro and a Cuban engineer on April 17 last, on
                            which occasion the Prime Minister declared publicly to a crowd of
                            several thousand persons, including Tinguaro workers, that the
                            Government would see to it that the mill is in operation next year. In
                            this connection Dr. Zaydín is reported to have said “Next year I will be
                            drinking guarapo with you instead of coffee.” Furthermore, the
                            Government engineer has apparently reported that the damage was far less
                            than at first supposed, that the machinery is practically all in usable
                            condition, that no parts or materials will have to be imported from
                            abroad, and that it will be a relatively small matter to put the mill”
                            in working condition. Mr. Keiser denied this, stating that a number of
                            parts, such as the heavy flywheels, were subjected to extreme heat which
                            might render their continued use extremely dangerous. However, Mr.
                            Keiser admitted that the Chief Engineer of his Company has not yet made
                            an inspection of Tinguaro (the fire occurred last January).</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. Keiser observed that there are no legal provisions which
                            would authorize the Government either to seize the mill or to force his
                            Company to rebuild it.</p>
                        <p>I spoke to Mr. Keiser with considerable frankness. I told him that from
                            every economic point of view I agreed with him 100 percent in his
                            estimate that Tinguaro, on its record, is probably not worth rebuilding.
                            I adverted to numerous speeches and private conversations during the
                            past year, in which I had advocated a basic reorganization of the Cuban
                            sugar industry, which would include the abandonment of a number of
                            marginal and submarginal mills as well as the removal from the books of
                            the non-grinding mills. Unless some such reorganization takes place, I
                            stated that I am not optimistic concerning the future of the industry
                            here, but I admitted that it would probably take little less than an
                            economic earthquake to bring about such a reorganization. Conceding that
                            the Prime Minister may have been somewhat reckless in the statements he
                            is reported to have made at Central Tinguaro, nevertheless it is a fact
                            that the Cuban Government is faced with increasingly difficult social
                            problems resulting from wartime conditions and the declining level of
                            commercial activity. I said that I would discuss the matter again with
                            the Prime Minister as soon as the latter recovers from his present
                            illness, but that I felt Mr. Keiser should in the meantime make every
                            effort to obtain local support. Specifically I said that he should
                            discuss his problem frankly with the Association of <hi rend="italic"
                                >Hacendados</hi><note n="2" xml:id="d188fn2">Association of Cuban
                                Sugar Mill Owners.</note> with a view to eliciting their endorsement
                            of the proposed sale. In that connection I mentioned the effectiveness
                            of the work of the <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0217"/>Asociaciόn
                            Nacional de Industrials de Cuba in the matter of the recent Bacardí<note

                            strike. I suggested that it might be equally effective should Mr. Keiser
                            obtain the backing of organized sugar labor, which he could seek to do
                            on the grounds (1) that labor involved in cutting, hauling and grinding
                            of Tinguaro cane by other mills would represent no reduction, and (2)
                            that Keiser was prepared to continue to make every effort to find jobs
                            for the Tinguaro <hi rend="italic">batey</hi> workers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Keiser appeared to be impressed by these suggestions, and he stated
                            that he would promptly investigate the possibilities.</p>
                        <p>With respect to <hi rend="italic">batey</hi> labor, Mr. Keiser informed
                            me that he has managed to place fifteen men with mechanical training
                            with the Nicaro Nickel Company, that he is endeavoring (without success
                            thus far) to interest others in peanut planting, and finally that he had
                            obtained fifty Tinguaro volunteers who desire to proceed to Florida. In
                            the last connection he showed me a cable from his New York office to the
                            effect that this plan, which had apparently been approved by all the
                            interested agencies of our Government, has now been blocked by the
                            Attorney General in Washington. I told Mr. Keiser that I was somewhat
                            surprised to receive this information in view of the recent expressions
                            of interest on the part of our Government in the utilization of Cuban
                            labor in the United States, and that I would telegraph the Department of
                            State requesting information in the premises. That message is my
                            telegram No. 278 of April 29, 8 p.m.<note n="4" xml:id="d188fn4">Not

                        <p>The Embassy at Habana reports, in despatch no. 3745 of July 8, 1943,<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d189fn4">Not printed.</note> that the Cuban Government
                            has brought suit against the Cuban-American Sugar Company, alleging that
                            the fire of early 1943 destroying most of the Central Tinguaro was of
                            incendiary origin. The company has employed an impressive array of legal
                            talent which it hopes will cause the case to be resolved favorably in
                            the very near future.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Keiser of the company is endeavoring to close a deal with Mr. Miller
                                <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0218"/>of the Atlántica, by which
                            the latter would dismantle the milL The Government objects to this
                            course, maintaining that the mill should be rebuilt and continued in
                            production. As an incentive, the Government indicates it may assist in
                            the reduction of the freight rate and grant an additional quota of
                            30,000 bags (potentially dangerous move as it would upset existing
                            quotas).</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has indicated to Dr. Mañas that it considers the resumption
                            of grinding as uneconomical, owing to the unsuccessful record of the
                            mill over a considerable period. Mr. Briggs<note n="7" xml:id="d189fn7"
                                >Ellis O. Briggs, Counselor of Embassy.</note> mentioned to Dr.
                            Mañas that he would be pleased to present his views to the Prime
                            Minister at a suitable time.</p>
                        <p>I agree with Mr. Briggs that it appears wholly desirable to remove this
                            uneconomic producer from the Cuban sugar picture.</p>
                        <p>On the telephone today Mr. Briggs said this case is getting very hot. The
                            Government is evidently forcing an early decision.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            case of the Tinguaro Central belonging to the Cuban-American Sugar
                            Company, an American concern, and to my several conversations during the
                            past many months with the Prime Minister regarding this matter. It had
                            been my hope that a satisfactory solution to the problem might have been
                            reached, as a result of ample time having been afforded for
                            consideration of the matter when the company, early this year, agreed to
                            pay the mill labor an amount equivalent to what would have been received
                            by the workers had the mill not been put out of operation by fire.</p>
                        <p>In view of my Government’s interest in any developments connected with
                            this situation, I should appreciate receiving any information which Your
                            Excellency can give me. Presently it would be helpful if I might have
                            the text of the Presidential Decree which, according to the press,
                            provides for the appointment of an interventor to see that
                            reconstruction is made and normal operation of the mill resumed either
                            by the company directly or, failing this, at its own expense.</p>
                        <p>My Government earnestly hopes that an amicable settlement of this entire
                            matter may be reached. However, in the event that the Cuban Government
                            should feel obliged, in effect, to expropriate in whole or part the
                            company’s mill or other property then, as in all such cases, the
                            attitude of my Government would be that, while recognizing the right of
                            expropriation, prompt, adequate and effective compensation for its
                            citizens affected by that right would be expected.</p>

                            the seizure of the mill and property by an interventor of the Cuban
                                Government.<note n="14" xml:id="d192fn14">Decree No.
                            2716.</note></p>
                        <p>The decree is an interesting document and in my opinion merits careful
                            perusal, if for no further reason than that it may lead to difficult and
                            perhaps unpleasant developments before the problem is finally settled.
                            As already reported, the interventor (Sr. José Cala-vechia, an
                            Italian-born Cuban engineer), has extremely wide powers which include
                            the seizure of the property, the reconstruction of the mill and the
                            operation of the enterprise for an indefinite period—all at the expense
                            of the owner, the Cuban American Sugar Company. Moreover, the Company
                            cannot regain possession without entering into commitments as to future
                            operation considered satisfactory by the Cuban Government, and
                            reimbursing the Government in full for all expenses incurred during the
                            period of intervention.</p>
                        <p>The text of the decree, particularly its preamble, has obviously been
                            drafted with an eye to the political situation. Citation is made to the
                            Government’s wartime emergency powers as authorizing the Government’s
                            step, but the various paragraphs are devoted primarily to the “social
                            responsibility” of mill owners, the social functions performed by sugar
                            mills, the rights of workers, the importance of Tinguaro to the economic
                            life of its zone, et cetera, with no reference to the uneconomic
                            operation of the mill (alleged by the Company—I am seeking specific
                            figures), or the fact that since the Tinguaro cane could be ground by
                            other mills in the vicinity the only workers who would really be
                            affected if Tinguaro were abandoned would be the 368 mill employees and
                            their families. While obviously it is desirable that steps be taken on
                            behalf of these workers, it appears at least debatable whether the
                            seizure of private American property in the circumstances set forth in
                            the decree, represents a solution. Furthermore, the decree does not even
                            approach the basic problem of the economy of the sugar industry of Cuba,
                            or the future of that industry in terms of high costs resulting from
                            artificial maintenance of marginal units.</p>
                        <p>All in all I can only consider the Government’s seizure of Tinguaro us an
                            expedient adopted for primarily political purposes, and if it is
                            resisted by the Company (as appears to be its intention) the prospects
                            are that protracted difficulties may ensue. Finally I am concerned not
                            only with respect to the sugar aspects of the problem but also on the
                            effect of this move—especially should it prove “successful” from the
                            point of view of the Cuban Government—on property rights in general in
                            Cuba. It was for this reason that I drafted my note of September 23 to
                            the Minister of State<note n="15" xml:id="d192fn15"><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Supra.</hi></note> in such a way as to leave no doubt <pb
                                n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0221"/>in the mind of the Cuban
                            Government concerning the views of my Government relative to
                            expropriation and compensation.</p>
                        <p>As intimated in previous despatches I do not consider that the blame for
                            the present unfortunate situation can be placed exclusively at the door
                            of the Cuban Government. As a result of my informal steps with the Prime
                            Minister last winter, shortly following the fire, seizure by the Cuban
                            Government at that time was avoided, and an opportunity was given to the
                            Cuban American Sugar Company to come forward with counter proposals and
                            suggestions and to make a genuine effort to meet the legitimate desire
                            of the Cuban Government to solve the social-economic (and political)
                            problem of the Municipality of Perico, of which Central Tinguaro is the
                            principal source of income. Mr. Keiser, President of the Cuban American
                            Sugar Company, agreed to pay the <hi rend="italic">batey</hi> workers
                            for the period of the zafra, which he did to the extent of over 40,000
                            pesos, but thereafter by his procrastination he unquestionably gave the
                            Prime Minister grounds for irritation and for asserting “recalcitrance”
                            on the part of the Company, notwithstanding numerous warnings which I
                            gave Keiser, supplemented by repeated discussions of the case with Dr.
                            Arturo Mañas, that unless Keiser bestirred himself the Prime Minister
                            would lose patience. During my absence in Washington last June and July
                            the matter was brought urgently to the attention of both Keiser and
                            Mañas by Mr. Briggs, and very shortly after my return to Habana on July
                            23, I again urged Keiser to come to Habana, since it then appeared that
                            unilateral action might be taken shortly after the then-scheduled
                            opening of the Special Session of the Cuban Congress in the first week
                            of August. It is true that Mafias has spent a large part of the past two
                            months in Washington in connection with the Cuban Government sugar
                            matters, but I do not regard his absence as any valid reason for the
                            non-appearance of Keiser himself in Habana.</p>
                        <p>In short, I believe that the record indicates inescapably that Keiser has
                            given grounds to the Cuban Government for alleging delay, resistance, et
                            cetera, which contributed to provoking the seizure of the Tinguaro
                            property.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Mañas “personal letter” to Dr. Zaydín<note n="16" xml:id="d192fn16"
                                >Letter dated September 21, 1943, not printed.</note> (the text
                            accompanied despatch No. 4582) in which he established as conditions
                            prerequisite to reconstruction by the Company a permanent addition to
                            Tinguaro quotas of 40,000 bags and a reduction of 50 per cent in railway
                            freight charges, did nothing to advance the problem. With respect to the
                            additional quota, Mañas is perfectly well aware that no such increase
                            could be given one mill without igniting an explosion of protest from
                            other <hi rend="italic">hacendados</hi>, each of whom would probably
                            argue with equally vehement eloquence that his proportional
                            participation in future crops <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0222"
                            />should similarly be raised. Mañas’ suggestion even involved the danger
                            of encouraging the Cuban Government to reopen the whole question of
                            quotas, as established seven years ago by Decree-Law No. 522, to the
                            satisfaction of the industry as a whole. With regard to freight rates,
                            Tinguaro may have a case for special consideration, but insofar as I am
                            aware the Company has never, between January 23 last when the mill was
                            damaged by fire, and September 24 when the decree was published,
                            submitted any detailed figures or analysis in support of its
                            contention.</p>
                        <p>I conclude therefore that whereas the unilateral action taken by the
                            Cuban Government was no doubt ill-advised and probably uneconomic, as
                            well as responsive principally to short-term political consideration,
                            nevertheless the Company must bear a substantial share of the
                            responsibility for its failure to take steps which in my judgment might
                            well have avoided this seizure.</p>
                        <p>Now that the issue has been joined, it is difficult to foresee how either
                            side can readily extricate itself. I believe that our Government should
                            stand on the principles set forth in my note to the Minister of State of
                            September 24 [<hi rend="italic">23</hi>], at the same time exercising
                            our continued informal good offices in an effort to work out some
                            practical compromise solution.</p>
                        <p>A complicating factor is the pending charge of culpability in regard to
                            the fire which the Cuban Government has brought against the local
                            Manager, Mr. Harris, and certain Tinguaro personnel. I do not believe
                            that Mr. Keiser has thus far viewed this case and the possibility of a
                            verdict of guilty (with attendant highly unfavorable publicity) with
                            sufficient seriousness.</p>

                        <p>1085. The Department appreciates the careful delineation of the Central
                            Tinguaro case presented in your Airgram no. A–2400, December 1, 4
                                p.m.,<note n="21" xml:id="d194fn21">Not printed.</note> which has
                            been of great assistance.</p>
                        <p>Since the Cuban courts are now reviewing the cases presented by the
                            Cuban-American Sugar Company concerning the interventorship of the mill,
                            the Department does not feel warranted in commenting on the legality of
                            the Cuban Government’s action. It does wish to point out, however, that
                            it has observed with concern the manner in which Cuban officials tend to
                            impugn the Cuban-American Sugar Company, as evidenced particularly by
                            the pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">El Oaso de Central “Tinguaro</hi>”,<note
                                n="22" xml:id="d194fn22">Copy transmitted to the Department by the
                                Ambassador in his despatch No. 5296, December 1, not printed.</note>
                            edited by the Cuban Ministry of Agriculture, and other statements.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s position with respect to expropriation of the property
                            remains unchanged. It will, of course, look to the Cuban Government for
                            just, prompt and adequate compensation in case of violation of property
                            rights including damages to the Company property subsequent to its
                            occupation by representatives of the Cuban Government.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s position in the matter has, it is believed, been
                            consistent with yours, in the sense of endeavoring through informal
                            means to promote a direct settlement between the Cuban Government and
                            the Cuban American Sugar Company. The Department has not felt called
                            upon to express an opinion as to the position assumed by the Cuban
                            Government to the effect that the reconstruction of the mill is in the
                            public interest. It does not seem to the Department that that is a
                            matter calling for an expression of opinion by this Government. However,
                            in view of the Cuban Government’s position, it seems that the direct
                            settlement toward which you have worked so painstakingly could only be
                            on a basis of reconstruction. The Department has been impressed with the
                            fact that the concessions, which the Cuban American Sugar Company has
                            indicated would be acceptable to it in connection with reconstruction,
                            seem highly unrealistic.</p>
                        <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0224"/>
                        <p>Officials of the Department have urged upon the Cuban Ambassador and
                            Lόpez Castro the desirability of a settlement of this case which would
                            avoid its being moved into the field of an international claim. The
                            Department will be interested in your views as to whether any progress
                            has been made since Mr. Keiser’s arrival in Cuba.</p>

                        <p>In response to my inquiry, Dr. Mañas gave me the following information
                            regarding the Tinguaro situation. He said that the engineer named
                            Calcavechia, who had been placed in charge by the Government, had
                            apparently done an honest piece of work, expending approximately
                            $175,000 and resisting a certain amount of political pressure which
                            might have led to unwise or wasteful spending. Dr. Mañas added that a
                            friend of his named Parajon, also an engineer, had stated that while the
                            job could not be considered a permanent piece of reconstruction work, it
                            is probable that the mill can function for one or two seasons.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Mafias then went on to describe the status of the court action in the
                            case. He said that the fact that the court denied by the very close vote
                            of nine to eight the Company’s request for the Cuban equivalent of an
                            injunction led him to believe that the prospects of a favorable decision
                            were fair, although he did not express any certainty on this point. He
                            also told me that Mr. Keiser was trying to sell the mill and that he,
                            Mañas, hoped he would be successful as this would be a good solution for
                            everyone. There appears to be a man named Blanco who is interested,
                            possibly at the suggestion of the Government. The price mentioned is
                            between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000, the principal asset being the
                            extensive cane lands owned by the Company.</p>

                            problem of the mill’s unprofitable record and the moral and legal
                            responsibilities of the directors to the stockholders. To my mind
                            reconstruction by the company in the light of that record would have
                            been less realistic than Reiser’s suggestions for increased quota and
                            reduced railroad tariff and that the Cuban Government’s refusal even to
                            consider anything except reconstruction (the establishment of a
                            different industry at the mill site or the transfer of Tinguaro labor
                            elsewhere for example) has rendered any satisfactory solution
                            exceedingly difficult.</p>
                        <p>Unless the mill should be sold or unless Keiser concludes that the
                            prospect for a few years of large crops (and hence perhaps profitable
                            Tinguaro operations) is such as to warrant his agreeing to operate I see
                            little prospect of avoiding further controversy<note n="24"

                                February 1944, by the sale of Central Tinguaro to an all-Cuban group
                                of investors, headed by Julio Lobo. Government control over the mill
                                was ended by Decree No. 593 published in <hi rend="italic">Gaceta

                            lead to an international claim. For this (as well as for the reasons

                            any action that could be misinterpreted in the sense that our Government
                            in the slightest degree condones this demagogic and irresponsible

                            confidentially, that Cuba may be forced to raise its ceiling prices on
                            certain vital food products such as rice, bread, and lard, as a result
                            of the increased c. i. f. Habana prices on imports from the United
                            States. He states that the increased prices in the United States during
                            December to February and the present shipping costs, will make necessary
                            an increase in retail prices.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, it is feared that an increase in Cuba’s ceiling prices on
                            these most essential food products, if made immediately after the <pb

                            price control.</p>
                        <p>It is stated that prices for rice, wheat flour, and lard, in the United
                            States have advanced considerably during 1942 and therefore the United
                            States guarantee not to increase prices above the level during the
                            highest month will not result in any relief to Cuba’s present situation
                            because Cuba based its ceiling prices on costs which prevailed earlier
                            in the year.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow tables of monthly prices c. i. f. Habana for wheat flour,
                            lard, and rice as reported by the ORPA.<note n="27" xml:id="d197fn27"
                                >Oficina de Regulaciόn de Precios y Abastecimientos (Cuban Office of

                        <p>It is stated that in the case of some exports to Cuba, the United States
                            ceilings have been too flexible to be effective in preventing price
                            increases and that in some cases the present prices offered to Cuba
                            appear to be above the ceilings.</p>
                        <p>The Cuban Office of Price Regulation and Supply states that the only way
                            in which Cuba can maintain its present price ceilings is to obtain a
                            reduction in (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) United States prices, or (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) in shipping charges. Consequently, it has
                            asked that the United States Government Agencies bear this matter in
                            mind in connection with the commitments made in the present sugar
                            negotiations. Furthermore, ORPA has requested the Embassy to transmit to
                            the War Shipping Administration a request for a reduction in the ocean
                            freight rates from Florida ports to Habana. These rates are now
                            approximately as follows: <table rows="3" cols="2">

                            <p>In the recent exchange of memoranda between the Government of the
                                United States and the Government of Cuba, both Governments agreed to
                                take appropriate measures with respect to price stabilization in
                                Cuba in 1943. The stability of the Cuban economy is a matter of
                                grave concern to both Governments. This memorandum is for the
                                purpose of agreeing upon a framework of reference wherein operations
                                can be undertaken and mechanisms can be devised to meet the
                                commitments in principle of the Government of the United States as
                                to the maintenance of the price of rice until September 1, 1943 and
                                wheat flour and hog lard landed in Cuba from the United States
                                during the remainder of 1943; and the concomitant undertaking of the
                                Government of Cuba to use its best efforts to maintain wholesale and
                                retail prices in Cuba at current levels on such imports of rice,
                                wheat flour and hog lard, as well as for the same food products
                                produced in Cuba, and also edible oils, meat, milk, beans, charcoal
                                and alcohol.</p>
                            <p>Since the cost of living of the Cuban people is the basic question
                                involved, it is, of course, understood that the maintenance of
                                prices at existing levels by the Government of Cuba means complete
                                enforcement of legal ceilings to the end that the Cuban consumers
                                receive the actual benefit of the price undertakings of the
                                Government of the United States. It would not be consistent in
                                principle for the Government of the United States to continue to
                                maintain agreed levels of prices for rice, wheat flour and hog lard

                                Board to Cuba for 1943 after deduction of purchases already made in
                                the United States and other countries. (The remainder is estimated
                                as 34,000,000 pounds.)</p>
                            <p>The Cuban Government will take appropriate measures to prevail upon

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Douglas</hi>: This Government has
                            committed itself to an effort to stabilize for the remainder of the
                            current calendar year, the landed cost of certain commodities important
                            to the cost of living in Cuba. Wheat flour is one of the commodities
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>In order to make the commitment regarding wheat flour effective, an
                            arrangement has been made whereby domestic mills will contract during a
                            two-week period, ending April 29, to deliver not more than 700,000
                            barrels of flour, at a base price not to exceed $6.90 per barrel, c. i.
                            f. Habana. This base price relates to a movement through Tampa, and
                            differentials in cost due to revised routing are for the account of the
                            Cuban buyer.</p>
                        <p>The freight differentials arising out of a change in marine rates are
                            also, by the custom of the trade, for the account of the buyer. However,
                            an increased cost resulting from a revision of marine rates would
                            violate the spirit and the letter of the arrangement that has been
                            entered with the Cuban Government. War risk insurance is also for the
                            account of the buyer, according to the custom of the trade, and this
                            Government has given the Cuban Government an assurance that the rate for
                            war risk insurance shall not exceed that in effect at present. Should
                            there be a modification in marine freight rates or war risk rates, it
                            would thus be incumbent upon some agency of this Government to
                            compensate the Cuban buyer.</p>
                        <p>The Department understands that there is no current intention to modify
                            either the freight rate or the war risk rate from United States ports to
                            Cuban ports. However, it has been felt that you should be advised of the
                            arrangements that have been made so that you will have knowledge of the
                            difficulties that would arise should the question of these rates be
                            considered at any time during the current calendar year.</p>

                            <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0231"/>Special emphasis is laid on the
                            prices of wheat, flour, hog lard and rice, which were guaranteed by this
                            Government as far as its exports to Cuba are concerned.</p>
                        <p>After special arrangements for an increased subsidy were made by
                                CCC,<note n="32" xml:id="d200fn32">Commodity Credit
                                Corporation.</note> Cuba was able to contract for a sufficient
                            amount of wheat flour to reach the end of the year without an increase
                            in ceiling prices. The ceiling will be maintained although bakers are
                            protesting the narrow margin between the cost of flour and the price of
                            bread.</p>
                        <p>No trouble appears to lie ahead with regard to hog lard prices and
                            supplies.</p>
                        <p>Rice has presented a real problem especially from the supply point of
                            view. The freezing of sixty percent of stocks in the United States gulf
                            area has removed Cuba’s normal supply of cheap rice. CCC and BEW<note

                            by State, have made successful efforts by supplying California rice at
                            an apparently reasonable price and more California rice is to be made
                            available. WSA<note n="34" xml:id="d200fn34">War Shipping
                                Administration.</note> has cooperated in giving a reduced freight
                            rate to California rice and is making available transportation for the
                            movement of certain Ecuadoran rice to Cuba.</p>
                        <p>It now appears that Cuba will reach the new Gulf shipping season of early
                            October with satisfactory, though curtailed, rice stocks on hand.</p>
                        <p>Prices of other articles of Cuban production are being maintained within
                            the Cuban ceilings with few exceptions, the most notable of which is
                            beef, reported to be selling from ten to forty percent above ceiling.
                            Since the date of the Embassy’s Attachéd report, a modest upward
                            adjustment in the ceiling on beef products has been put into effect by
                            ORPA.</p>

                            prevailed in 1943 for United States rice, until September 1, 1944; for
                            United States wheat flour, until January 1, 1945; and for United States
                            hog lard, until September 30, 1944.</p>
                        <p>In return, it was agreed that Your Excellency’s Government would
                            undertake to maintain and effectively to enforce in Cuba the existing
                            wholesale and retail ceiling prices not only for these three
                            commodities, but also for edible oils, meat, milk, beans, charcoal and
                            alcohol, and that if during 1944 the Cuban Sugar Stabilization Institute
                            or its assignees should derive any benefit from increase in the price of
                            raw sugar, as provided in Article 4 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) of the

                                for sugar above the contract rate of 2.65 cents per pound.</note> my
                            Government would benefit to a proportionate extent in connection with
                            prices of rice, wheat flour and hog lard.</p>
                        <p>Since the cost of living of the Cuban people is the basic question
                            involved, Your Excellency’s Government will of course understand that
                            the maintenance of prices at existing levels by the Government of Cuba
                            implies effective enforcement of the legal Cuban ceiling prices, to the
                            end that the Cuban consumers may receive the actual benefit of my
                            Government’s price stabilization undertakings. It would not be
                            consistent in principle for my Government to continue to maintain agreed
                            levels of prices for rice, wheat flour and hog lard shipped from the
                            United States to Cuba should it develop that Cuban consumers are not
                            benefiting to the extent contemplated by these undertakings.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the agreement reached, the United States Department of

                            of origin of the shipment. The regulations now in effect are the same as
                            those existing when last year’s negotiations took place. No attempt is
                            made to allocate the varieties of rice which will be imported since it
                            is assumed that the Cuban importers will select those varieties which
                            best suit their particular customers and best fit into the price
                            schedule at the time of purchase.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that Cuba will not make purchases of rice in the United
                            States at c. i. f. Habana prices higher than those provided for above
                            without prior approval of the United States Department of Agriculture
                            and the War Food Administration.</p>
                        <p>The Office of Economic Warfare will use its best efforts to secure
                            maximum practical movement of rice through Gulf ports.</p>
                        <p>The quantities of rice involved in this undertaking shall be in
                            accordance with the allocations made by the Combined Food Board to Cuba
                            for the year beginning October 1, 1943. It is expected that the total
                            allocation will be equal to the 375 million pounds allocated the
                            preceding year. Part of the allocation will be from sources other than
                            the United States, and the United States cannot undertake responsibility
                            if the price at such foreign sources should exceed the agreed price at
                            which United States rice is to be delivered c. i. f. Habana. There is,
                            however, the possibility that the United States might own substantial
                            quantities of rice in foreign countries. Should this be the case, the
                            United States would agree to deliver the allocations made to Cuba from
                            sources other than the United States at the same price as though the
                            rice were being delivered from the United States for similar type and
                            grade.</p>

                            this quantity will equal or exceed last year’s allocation which was 45
                            million pounds for the entire year. This allocation, however, will be
                            firm only for one quarter at a time, it being understood that any lard
                            secured by Cuba from other sources will be taken into account when the
                            allocation is made for the subsequent quarter. It is further understood
                            that Cuba may be requested to obtain more than a single quarter
                            allocation of lard in one quarter and that should it fail to obtain the
                            directed amount, there will be no obligation to make up the amount
                            missed in subsequent quarters.</p>

                            contribution toward the prevention of further increases in the cost of
                            living in Cuba, and that Your Excellency’s Government will in turn find

                            note No. 1155 of October 25, 1943, transmitting such proposals to the
                            Cuban Government was forwarded to the Department in Embassy despatch No.

                        <p>The reply of the Cuban Government includes a memorandum from the Office

                            1944 the ceiling prices for rice, wheat flour, beef, milk and charcoal.
                            Assurances against such price increases were requested in the Embassy’s
                            note in return for our assistance in supplying Cuba with rice, wheat
                            flour and lard. The Minister of State now asks the opinion of the United

                                    in recent months to purchase their usual types of United States
                                    rice with a high broken content, on. which Cuban ceiling prices
                                    are based. Instead, United States mills have been willing to
                                    sell only rice with a low broken content, whose cost makes
                                    impossible its purchase and sale under Cuban retail ceilings and
                                    thereby contributes toward general disregard of such ceilings.
                                    The ORPA believes that, unless the United States can undertake
                                    to supply Cuba with its usual types of rice with a high broken
                                    content, the ceiling prices in Cuba may have to be raised to
                                    cover the <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0236"/>increased
                                    costs of the better quality rice. The Embassy’s opinion is that
                                    the analysis made by the ORPA is essentially correct with
                                    respect to the arguments set forth.</item>

                                <item><hi rend="italic">Wheat Flour</hi>. The price plan for wheat
                                    flour is stated to be the same as during 1943, yet the price for
                                    1944 is based on New Orleans shipment instead of on Tampa, as
                                    last year. During 1943, most flour moved through ports other
                                    than Tampa, and as Tampa involves the highest freight cost, a
                                    considerable saving was made by Cuban buyers. The shift to New
                                    Orleans basis eliminates most possibilities for such savings
                                    during 1944. ORPA therefore contends that the basis should be
                                    shifted to Tampa in order to continue the prices as delivered to
                                    Cuban buyers at the same level as in 1943. The Embassy believes
                                    that ORPA is not illogical in this attitude, but on the other
                                    hand the United States neither in 1943 nor in 1944 assured Cuba
                                    anything beyond a maximum price c. i. f. Habana.</item>

                                    of Cuba are applying great pressure to the ORPA for an increase
                                    in ceiling prices for meat and milk, threatening to stop
                                    deliveries and to curtail production if ORPA does not accede to
                                    their demands. ORPA so far has resisted such pressure but
                                    evidently does not feel sufficiently strong in its position to
                                    pledge to the United States that it will not capitulate.</item>

                                <item><hi rend="italic">Charcoal</hi>. Retail ceiling prices for
                                    charcoal have been ineffective during the past half year.
                                    Attempts by the ORPA to gain control by manipulation of producer
                                    prices and dealer margins have been unsuccessful. The ORPA
                                    realistically recognizes that it may be the best policy to
                                    increase the retail maximum in order to place the ceiling price
                                    somewhere in line with current selling prices, since enforcement
                                    of any lower price has proved impossible.</item>

                        <p>As the appropriate agencies of the United States Government apparently
                            desired the blanket assurances of the Cuban Government against retail
                            price increases, in return for the United States assistance with price
                            stabilization for rice, wheat flour and lard, the Embassy desires to
                            know whether or not the exceptions made above are acceptable to the
                            United States agencies. It is the Embassy’s opinion that a reiteration
                            of our request that there be no price increases might meet with the
                            ultimate acquiescence of the Cuban Government. The result of this,
                            however, would be in all likelihood a complete breakdown of ceiling
                            price enforcement, so that the better policy might be agreement to
                            controlled price increase when demonstrated to be clearly essential.</p>

                            with information received from other sources convince me that if a
                            successful start is to be made on the diversification program this year,
                            the plan will have to be made considerably more attractive than thus
                            far, and there must be a real incentive to Cuban producers. As I see it,
                            the two principal deterrents are price and lack of assured market after
                            1943.</p>
                        <p>Having in mind the serious preoccupation of our Government with respect
                            to this problem and its importance on long-range consideration of Cuban
                            economy, I urge therefore that the situation be carefully reviewed in
                            order to determine how far we can go and in particular whether it can be
                            made so worth-while for local production to be expanded that the Cuban
                            Government will <hi rend="italic">ipso facto</hi> be able to put on a
                            successful campaign and to meet local criticism and inertia. The Cuban
                            Government is, I believe, prepared to make genuine efforts in this
                            direction.</p>
                        <p>With respect to peanuts I doubt whether, regardless of price, Cuba is
                            likely to have any considerable 1943 surplus since last year’s
                            production must be increased from 40,000,000 pounds to 100,000,000
                            pounds unshelled before local crushing facilities are exceeded. At the
                            $3.65 present offer to growers ($6.88 Habana shelled in bags) I have
                            found little enthusiasm so far as additional plantings are concerned,
                            although Lόpez Castro states confidently that at $4.00 to growers
                            (approximately $7.50 in Habana) he believes the Government will be able
                            to support a real campaign and effectively increase production. As
                            indicated in airgram No. A–365, whatever machinery we can make available
                            should also influence production to an important degree.</p>
                        <p>As regards corn and beans, no definite price offer has yet been
                            forthcoming from Washington, although the Cuban delegation<note n="44"

                            these crops.</p>
                        <p>To summarize, I believe a further over-all survey of diversification
                            possibilities should be made, and that if possible we should be prepared
                            to make a definite commitment for a period in excess of one year and
                            also to provide a minimum amount of equipment. If we are even to make a
                            start in 1943, very prompt action is indicated, since the planting
                            season is practically upon us.</p>

                            obstructions with which we continuously have to contend here—the
                            inertia, the unsound thinking of our Cuban friends, coupled with a
                            supine reliance on us and therefore a tendency to blame the U. S. A.
                            when the going gets tough.</p>
                        <p>These mental hazards have been especially apparent in connection with the
                            diversification program and will render its general acceptance more
                            difficult. However, this program is of such importance for us as well as
                            the Cubans, not merely from the aspect of the well-being of this island
                            but of the entire Caribbean area, that I believe the time and effort we
                            may spend on it will be well worth while. Moreover, we are making
                            progress in some quarters, especially from the standpoint of its leading
                            to the development of crops which will help Cuba to feed herself. If we
                            can win on this front, then we may later succeed in the development of
                            cash crops for export.</p>
                        <p>Insofar as diversification this year is concerned, it is only fair to
                            observe, as I have in recent despatches, that we too have been at
                            fault—understandably so in view of the extreme pressure on everyone in
                            Washington. In particular, all of our conversations so far in respect to
                            corn and beans have been handicapped because we could mention no price,
                            while on peanuts we have offered a price which would give much incentive
                            were we also able to supply the required mechanical equipment,
                            especially tractors, but which on the basis of manual labor for clearing
                            ground, et cetera, is not sufficiently attractive to produce any great
                            results. Moreover instead of loaning seed peanuts to be repaid in kind,
                            as originally suggested by us, the problem is now complicated by our
                            making it a sale transaction.</p>

                        <p>I may be indulging in over-simplification. Nevertheless I feel that the
                            long pull approach to Cuban economy—fundamentally sugar-must sooner or
                            later, and preferably sooner, include (1) genuine research, (2)
                            diversification, (3) a revamping of the industry on this Island.</p>
                        <p>A start, halting though it be, has been made on (2) and it should be

                            industrially for about 40 cents. Also he has brought with him a sample
                            of a plastic made from sugar juices. This latter development is still
                            embryonic but may at least hold hope for the future.</p>

                                diversification. This program was discussed by officials of both
                                Governments and it was concluded that the benefits derived therefrom
                                would tend to alleviate the economic situation of Cuba that may
                                result from the reduced sugar grinding made necessary by the

                                xml:id="d206fn49">Joaquín Martínez Sáenz.</note> while expressing
                            satisfaction with the bases for the accord between the Cuban and the
                            United States Governments for the purchase until May 1, 1944 of the
                            exportable surplus of corn and legumes, requests in effect for Cuba the
                            benefit under an escalator provision of any rise of prices for these
                            commodities occurring in the United States market.</p>
                        <p>The Department, together with the Commodity Credit Corporation and the
                            Board of Economic Warfare, has given this additional request of the
                            Cuban Government most careful consideration. This Government has in this
                            connection reviewed the course of the discussions in Washington with
                            Señor Amadeo Lόpez Castro which led to the purchase agreement. The
                            prices which were eventually reached and agreed to were determined
                            solely by the amount of incentive estimated to be necessary to stimulate
                            production of these commodities. At no time were the prices linked with
                            United States markets; and the question of an escalator clause was not
                            injected into the discussions. The Department, in fact, recalls that
                            Señor Lόpez Castro departed fully satisfied with the terms for the
                            purchase.</p>

                        <p>A–1078. Due to late arrival and increase in quantity of peanut seed
                            shipped to Cuban Ministry of Agriculture in April, a large portion
                            remains unplanted. Four million pounds of seed were delivered to
                            Ministry, (only 3 million originally requested) of which about 1.25
                            million has been delivered to planters. Ministry expects to use possibly
                            0.5 million for fall planting, leaving more than 2 million pounds unused
                            in 1943.</p>
                        <p>Storage until 1944 would involve considerable expense, require valuable
                            storage space, necessitate frequent thorough fumigation, and involve
                            some loss due to insect damage and reduced germination. Ministry,
                            therefore, requests authorization to crush remainder for <pb n="228"

                                Secretary of State in airgram A–1556 of June 17, expressed “regrets
                                that Cuba has now found it impossible to plant all the peanuts they
                                requested for seed” and stated that the Department had “no
                                objection” to crushing the unused balance though “it must be
                                understood that a like amount of edible oil will be deducted from
                                the U.S. allocation to Cuba.” (837.613/37)</note> If crushed in June
                            or July, this would increase Cuban crushing capacity since crushers are
                            now idle until August.</p>

                                Minneman.</note> concerning conversations with representatives of
                            the American Dehydrating Company of Cuba about that company’s project
                            for large scale dehydration of vegetables under contract with the
                            Commodity Credit Corporation. All the negotiations in connection with
                            this project and contract have been carried on in Washington. These
                            memoranda show the progress of that company’s plans involving the
                            construction of several large dehydration plants in Cuba.</p>
                        <p>While the Embassy is in sympathy with the idea of producing dehydrated
                            vegetables in Cuba, it anticipates that the company may have
                            considerable difficulty in obtaining the steady supply of raw vegetables
                            which would be necessary for the successful operation of this large
                            project. The kinds of vegetables that are to make up 60 percent of the
                            production under the contract have heretofore not been grown
                            commercially in Cuba and apparently cannot be grown satisfactorily
                            during the summer season. (See Embassy’s airgram A–887 of May 8; and
                            despatch No. 3051 of May ll.<note n="56" xml:id="d208fn56">Neither
                                printed.</note>) For this reason it would appear to be advisable
                            that the project be started gradually in order that experience from the
                            operation of the first unit may serve as a guide for the other two or
                            three units and possibly avoid the expenditure of valuable strategic
                            materials in the construction of plants if difficulties are experienced
                            in obtaining an adequate supply of raw vegetables.</p>
                        <p>In the last paragraph of enclosure No. 2 Mr. Howard states that, although
                            the question of supply of equipment and materials for the <pb n="229"
                                xml:id="pg_229" facs="0243"/>construction of the plants is
                            apparently being handled in Washington, it would be desirable if the
                            Embassy could be informed as to what extra provision is being made for
                            the steel, tinplate and fuel oil which will be needed for the
                            construction and operation of these plants.</p>

                        <p>This machinery was unloaded beginning June 11, after payment of demurrage
                            caused by the Fomento’s neglect of arrangements for receiving and
                            handling. At the present date, June 29, the machinery is still in crates
                            at Habana awaiting formulation of plans for distribution which
                            apparently have not been satisfactorily established between the Fomento
                            and the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
                        <p>It is of interest to note that the shipment is largely planting machinery
                            which arrived in Cuba too late to be used for summer crops. Only the
                            rice binders and threshers have any prospect of being used on the
                            present crop.</p>
                        <p>The peanut pickers which are considered by the Embassy to be most
                            important and to be needed most urgently for the harvest already
                            beginning, have not yet arrived in Cuba. The Embassy’s telegram No. 436

                            and to the Embassy’s despatch no. 3873 of July 20,<note n="59"
                                xml:id="d210fn59">Neither printed.</note> and to report that the
                            contract for the purchase of Cuba’s total export surplus of corn from
                            the 1944 crop was signed today by the Minister of Agriculture. The
                            revised draft of this contract was received from Washington on July 15.
                            Four signed copies of the contract are transmitted herewith.<note n="60"
                                xml:id="d210fn60">Not printed.</note> It is understood that three of
                            these copies should be transmitted to the Office of Economic Warfare for
                            the use of that agency and the Commodity Credit Corporation.</p>
                        <p>Although no reliable estimate is available concerning the quantity of
                            export surplus corn which will be available, the Ministry of Agriculture
                            has recently estimated the 1943 plantings at 464,000 acres with an
                            estimated production of 489 million pounds. The Embassy believes that
                            this estimate is too high, but it is evident that there has been
                            considerable increase in production and that appreciable quantities will
                            be available for export. By far the greatest production (about 41
                            percent of the total) is in Oriente Province in the extreme eastern end
                            of the island.</p>
                        <p>The contract provides that the Commodity Credit Corporation shall take
                            delivery of the corn at railroad stations throughout the island. The
                            Minister expressed the opinion that there would probably not be more
                            than twenty delivery points, but nevertheless it is obvious that the
                            Corporation will have to have available at least two, and possibly more,
                            inspectors to sample the corn and to determine whether it meets with our
                            qualifications, et cetera. These inspectors, who should if possible have
                            some knowledge of Spanish, should be in Cuba not later than August 5, as
                            the Minister expects that the corn crop will begin to move during the
                            first half of August.</p>
                        <p>It is the Minister’s plan to assign to the Corporation the corn produced
                            by a certain number of the largest growers. These will probably be
                            mostly sugar companies, a number of which have gone into the production
                            of corn this year on a large scale.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that the Sugar Cane Growers’ Association has agreed to
                            establish a revolving fund of $100,000 to finance growers who are
                            financially unable to await payment from the Corporation.</p>
                        <p>He assured us that in accordance with the terms of the contract he would
                            immediately notify the Cuban authorities to prohibit the exportation of
                            corn, except in the case of corn shipped by or for the <pb n="231"
                                xml:id="pg_231" facs="0245"/>account of the Corporation. The
                            Minister suggested that the Corporation would be given a general export
                            license to cover its exports of corn from Cuba.</p>
                        <p>Similar contracts for the purchase of peanuts and beans are expected to
                            be completed in the near future.</p>

                        <p>The American Dehydrating Company of Cuba has a contract with Commodity
                            Credit Corp. to dehydrate 40,000,000 lbs. of sweet potatoes and beets in
                            Cuba. The Government of Cuba heartily welcomed this contract and viewed
                            it as the first and foremost practical step in meeting the desires of
                            the U. S. and Cuba to help Cuba diversify its crops and improve the
                            economic position of the small farmers. We so announced it to the
                            public.</p>
                        <p>We were particularly pleased when the American Dehydrating Company of
                            Cuba decided to spread its purchases over three provinces, namely,
                            Havana, Matanzas and Camaguey, by erecting three smaller plants rather
                            than one large plant.</p>
                        <p>Officials and citizens of these provinces enthusiastically agreed to
                            cooperate and farmers in the first two immediately undertook to raise
                            the necessary vegetables.</p>
                        <p>Federal officials agreed to help with tax concessions, road building,
                            loan of machinery, etc. Our Minister of Agriculture undertook with great
                            satisfaction to encourage the farmers to grow the required vegetables,
                            to supervise the planting, to lay out an insecticide program, and in
                            every way to induce the farmers to participate in this diversification
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Cuba granted certificates of necessity and letters of endorsement for the

                                    and <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0246"/>that farmers in

                                    for this dehydration contract.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>That there is an impression that the Cuban Government is only
                                    lukewarm to this great project.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>That therefore export licenses and priority certificates for
                                    necessary steel and equipment are being refused to the American
                                    Steel Corporation of Cuba which is constructing these
                                    plants.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>We therefore state emphatically that: <list>

                                <item>The Government of Cuba is most anxious that this project be

                                    authorized to state that our Government will help in every way;
                                    that we consider the program of the American Dehydrating Company
                                    of Cuba one of the most if not the most important project of our

                                    that the farmers are anxious to grow beets for this dehydration

                                    to enable the American Dehydrating Company to carry out its
                                    contracts in full. We know of our own knowledge that farmers are

                        <p>The Ambassador of Cuba presents his compliments to His Excellency the
                            Secretary of State and has the honor to inform him that he has received
                            instructions from his Government to request His Excellency’s good
                            offices with the different war economic agencies of his Government to
                            obtain the approval of a project for the establishment in Cuba of three
                            plants for dehydrating vegetables to be installed and operated by the
                            American Dehydrating Company of Cuba, which has been submitted and is
                            awaiting approval by the said war economic agencies.</p>
                        <p>As His Excellency knows, the establishment of the said three dehydrating
                            plants will have the immediate purpose of supplying 40,000,000 pounds of
                            dehydrated vegetables to the United States, through a contract already
                            signed between the Commodity Credit Corporation and the American
                            Dehydrating Company of Cuba. This contract, in addition to signifying an
                            effective collaboration of the <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0247"
                            />people of Cuba in the supplying of food to the Army and people of the
                            United States, will result in the cultivation of about 40,000 acres of
                            land on approximately 3,000 small estates and in the employment of a
                            substantial number of workers. In the industrial process the plants will
                            employ about 3,000 workers and in the farming operations, in the seasons
                            of cultivation and harvesting of the crops, approximately 20,000
                            agricultural workers will obtain employment.</p>
                        <p>The interest of my Government in the approval of this project is
                            accentuated by the fact that, in order to carry out fully its agreement
                            with the Commodity Credit Corporation, the American Dehydrating Company
                            of Cuba has already signed contracts with Cuban farmers and the latter
                            have begun their work in preparation for seeding and, in case the
                            project is disapproved, wholly or in part, by the agencies of this
                            Government, considerable difficulties and losses will be caused for the
                            Cuban farmers.</p>
                        <p>The establishment of the dehydrating plants will represent a step of real
                            progress and of great magnitude in the program of diversified
                            agriculture which my Government is carrying on with the valued
                            cooperation and aid of Your Excellency’s Government, and very especially
                            of the Department of State, for this project will not limit its scope to
                            supplying food for the United States during the present emergency
                            period, but, after the end of this period, the dehydrating plants will
                            make possible the exportation of vegetable products which in their
                            natural state can not be sold abroad because of their easy and rapid
                            decomposition. At the same time and for the same reason, the dehydration
                            of vegetables will make easier and more economical the domestic supply
                            for the people of Cuba, thus improving their nutritional standards,
                            because, due to the warmth and humidity of our climate, fresh vegetables
                            and fruits have prohibitive distribution costs which make their
                            consumption by the poor and middle classes of our country impossible.
                            The Ambassador of Cuba will be profoundly grateful for the attention
                            which Your Excellency may show this request.</p>

                        <p>In reply to the memorandum of July 27 of Dr. Amadeo Lόpez Castro,
                            concerning the dehydration project of the American Dehydrating Company
                            of Cuba, the Department of State is pleased to have an opportunity to
                            comment on the project and to express appreciation of the determination
                                <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0248"/>of the Government of Cuba
                            supporting the agricultural diversification program. It is a source of
                            real gratification to note the substantial progress already being made;
                            for example in the production of corn, the present crop of which is one
                            of the largest in Cuban history.</p>
                        <p>During recent years and especially during last winter’s general economic
                            discussions, the Department of State and other interested agencies of
                            this Government have maintained a keen interest in the continuation and
                            intensification of Cuba’s diversification program. To that end the
                            Department has assisted in making available certain agricultural
                            machinery, and as Dr. Lόpez Castro is aware, contracts for production of
                            the various agricultural items such as corn, beans, and surplus dairy
                            products are under active consideration at present.</p>
                        <p>The project of the American Dehydrating Company of Cuba has received most
                            careful attention and study by the American Embassy at Habana and the
                            Department since its inception during March 1943. Every effort has been
                            made to reach a fair and helpful determination that can be justified on
                            the basis of production potentialities of beets and sweet potatoes, and
                            consistent with the availability of iron and steel materials and of fuel
                            oil and tinplate. The Department has concluded that it may reasonably
                            recommend to the War Production Board the construction of one
                            dehydration plant and it maintains the position that, in view of the
                            lack of experience in the commercial production in Cuba of most of the
                            vegetables under contract, that consideration of further construction be
                            deferred pending the visit to Cuba of technical dehydration experts,
                            which will take place within the next few weeks, according to advices
                            received by the Department from the Office of Economic Warfare.<note

                            of the first factory, which is understood to be nearing completion.</p>

                            dehydrated vegetables are scarce and as the present production capacity
                            of dehydrated vegetables is sufficient for all possible needs. According
                            to this memorandum, the Commodity Credit Corporation is reportedly
                            willing to release the American Dehydrating Company from its obligations

                            the materials and equipment required for the first of the three
                            dehydrating plants his company desires to erect and that he is extremely
                            anxious to erect the second plant in order to be able to comply with the
                            contract between his company and the Commodity Credit Corporation. Mr.
                            Cohen requested the Embassy to make a definite recommendation in this

                            and to which the American Dehydrating Company is called upon to deliver
                            under its contract.</p>
                        <p>The question now arises, however, as to what action should be pursued by
                            the Embassy in connection with import recommendations covering iron and
                            steel and other strategic materials for the plants in question.
                            According to the original estimates submitted by the company to the
                            Embassy, approximately 1,300,000 pounds of steel were required for each
                            plant. To date certificates of necessity for about 462,000 pounds of
                            steel and import recommendations for roughly 241,000 pounds of steel
                            have been approved against the third and fourth quarter estimates of
                            supply, respectively, leaving some 600,000 pounds more to be granted for
                            the completion of the first plant. In view of the Cuban Government’s
                            interest in the project, it may be assumed that the Import and Export
                            Agency will issue against future estimates of supply additional import
                            recommendations to cover the steel and other materials required to
                            complete the first plant, as well <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236"
                                facs="0250"/>as the second and, possibly, a third plant. The Embassy
                            is therefore urgently in need of a definite statement as to the
                            interested agencies’ views in the matter and whether they propose to
                            approve export license applications for the materials, supplies and
                            equipment required for the erection of a second or even a third
                            plant.</p>
                        <p>Pending receipt of the Department’s instructions, the Embassy will
                            approve import recommendations up to the amounts required for the
                            construction of the first plant (now nearing completion at Colon), and
                            any additional import recommendations for this project will be submitted
                            to the Department for such action as it may be decided to take with
                            regard thereto.</p>

                            Dehydrating Company and requesting a definite statement as to the

                        <p>Mr. Cohen has been advised that Commodity Credit Corporation will
                            administer his contract in such a way that he will not be embarrassed by

                            copies of a contract<note n="67" xml:id="d216fn67">Not printed.</note>
                            executed today on behalf of the Commodity Credit Corporation and the
                            Cuban Ministry of Agriculture for the purchase of export surplus
                            peanuts.</p>
                        <p>Although the contract is executed by the Minister of Agriculture, the
                            Ministry does not have facilities for actually purchasing the peanuts
                            and paying the growers for them, transporting them to Habana, and
                            shelling them for delivery f. a. s. vessel for export. Therefore, the
                            contract provides that the Minister may appoint agents to perform these
                            operations for the Ministry. Two leading vegetable oil crushers,
                            Sabates, S. A., and Hershey Corporation, also have signed agreements
                            with the Ministry to act as agents to perform these functions.</p>
                        <p>Although Cuba’s peanut production this year is approximately double that
                            of last year, production is still slightly below the capacity of Cuban
                            oil crushers and, therefore, no export surplus from the 1943 crop is
                            anticipated. The contract contains an option under which the purchase
                            program may be continued to cover the 1944 crop.</p>

                            despatch No. 5034 of November 5, 1943,<note n="71" xml:id="d218fn71">Not
                                printed.</note> which stated my intention to discuss with Cuban
                            officials the ineffective use in 1943 of farm machinery furnished to the
                            Ministry of Agriculture to assist the program for agricultural
                            diversification.</p>
                        <p>I had the opportunity to take up this matter briefly during my meeting of
                            November 8 with the Prime Minister, at which Ingeniero Amadeo Lόpez
                            Castro was present. I pointed out that the failure of the Cuban
                            Government to provide for effective utilization of the machinery had
                            unfortunate effects for the United States agencies which were
                            instrumental in obtaining the equipment, and also on the attitude of the
                            American Congress, the implication being that these development <pb
                                n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0253"/>have damaged the prospects for
                            obtaining additional equipment for Cuba.</p>
                        <p>Ingeniero Lόpez Castro replied that the equipment arrived too late in
                            1943 for use in spring planting. This of course is true, but does not
                            justify the failure to distribute the tractors and plows for use in
                            planting fall crops, including beans and peanuts which are highly
                            important with respect to agricultural diversification; nor does it
                            explain the failure to make more effective use of peanut and rice
                            harvesting machinery. Assembly of rice harvesting equipment was not even
                            begun until the fall harvest season was under way, only a portion of
                            this machinery was actually distributed, and the balance now is of no
                            use until the fall of 1944. As there was no plan whatsoever for
                            distribution of equipment upon its arrival in June 1943, it does not
                            appear likely that the machinery would have been distributed in time for
                            spring crops of 1943 even though it had arrived prior to their planting
                            dates.</p>
                        <p>The shortage of gas oil also was presented by Ingeniero Lόpez Castro as a
                            hindrance to effective use of the farm machinery. This can not be
                            considered a valid excuse for failure to distribute the equipment, as
                            demand for tractors and rice harvesting equipment would at the proper
                            time in 1943 have absorbed the machines regardless of the prospective
                            fuel problem with respect to their operation. The matter of gas oil was
                            discussed in detail at the same meeting and Ingeniero Lόpez Castro, when
                            informed that the Cuban quota could not be increased, expressed his
                            intention of taking up the matter in Washington. This intention was
                            reported to the Department in the Embassy’s telegram No. 722 of November
                            8, 1943.<note n="74" xml:id="d218fn74">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>As sale and distribution of the farm machinery now is proceeding as
                            rapidly as is reasonable considering that there is no immediate occasion
                            for its use at this season, no further action is contemplated by the
                            Embassy except with respect to Cuban allocations for 1944, as described
                            in the closing paragraph of the Embassy despatch mentioned above.</p>

                        <p>279. Reference Embassy’s A–356, February 24, 9 a.m. The Department has
                            discussed with Export-Import Bank the matter of making machinery and
                            equipment available to the Cuban War and Navy <pb n="243"
                                xml:id="pg_243" facs="0257"/>Departments. The Bank believes and the
                            Department concurs that it would be unwise for the Bank to approve the
                            use of funds under public works loan for the purchase of equipment to be
                            used elsewhere than on projects it has approved. The Bank believes such
                            action would violate Cuban law authorizing loan and agreement signed
                            thereunder. The Department also understands from Montoulieu<note n="90"

                            prepared to confer with Colonel Covell and representatives of the

                                satisfactory arrangement, but the question of payment for this

                            December 12 and your letter of December 21, 1942,<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d227fn4">Neither found In Department files.</note> both
                            addressed to the President, regarding materials for certain projects
                            requested by President Batista of Cuba at the time of his visit to
                            Washington. At that time you indicated that we could take up two of
                            these projects, the water supply and sewage disposal system at Santiago,
                            and the water supply system at Guantánamo, in February or March.</p>
                        <p>I have held off discussing these projects further with you pending
                            completion of a number of other economic arrangements with Cuba.
                            President Batista has now sent me a message that he is most anxious to
                            begin at once to carry out his personal commitments to the cities of his
                            home province that the long overdue sanitary improvements would be
                            resumed during his tenure of office. The health conditions in
                            Guantánamo, adjacent to our Naval Station, are deplorable and constitute
                            a menace not only to the health of the Cuban residents, but of our naval
                            personnel. The water supply of Santiago, the second city of Cuba, and a
                            very important port for sugar and for transshipment to other islands, is
                            also extremely bad. Moreover, the inability of the United States to
                            provide shipping for the transportation of Cuban export products,
                            notably sugar, is occasioning a severe measure of economic depression,
                            and this is particularly acute in the east end of the island, where
                            these cities are located. The carrying out of these works projects would
                            thus afford a measure of relief to the local unemployed.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the total material requirements of these projects are very
                            small, and President Batista has indicated his willingness to deduct the
                            iron and steel from the usual small allocations which the War Production
                            Board has been making available for Cuba. In addition, he is prepared to
                            have engineers of this Government go carefully through the projects
                            eliminating all but the most essential critical materials, so that the
                            net strain will be very small indeed. Moreover, although the employment
                            aspect of the projects is important to him, the political aspect is so
                            important that he is prepared if necessary <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247"
                                facs="0261"/>to see them proceed very slowly, thus spreading any use
                            of critical materials very thinly over a considerable period of
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Only with great difficulty has the President of Cuba been able to explain
                            to his people the inevitability of war sacrifices and the difficulties
                            with which the United States is faced in cooperating with Cuba to
                            mitigate the dislocations which have arisen from the shortage of
                            critical materials and of shipping. Furthermore, in military as well as
                            economic fields we have unfortunately been able to carry out only in
                            part the programs to which we had obligated ourselves previously. The
                            President and the people of Cuba have collaborated wholeheartedly with
                            us right down the line of military and economic matters, but the
                            President fears difficulties in continuing to carry out his broad policy
                            of cooperation if the political and social problems arising in Cuba,
                            especially in the eastern end of the island, are not at least partially
                            alleviated. He believes that the carrying out of his personal pledges to
                            complete the two projects which I have mentioned will do most, with but
                            a small cost in materials, to take care of the situation.</p>
                        <p>After the most careful survey of the Cuban situation, I am forced to
                            concur with President Batista’s analysis of his situation and wish to
                            emphasize to you the political importance of these small projects as
                            contrasted with the small expenditure of materials contemplated. I
                            request, therefore, that you approve the assignment of materials to
                            permit these projects to go forward.</p>

                        <p>The original recommendation was to the effect that the major portion of
                            the loan should be used for agricultural projects and roads. The present
                            plan greatly reduces the agricultural share and omits entirely several
                            items such as research, reforestation and rehabilitation.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Roads:</hi> Note that the estimate for the Central
                            Highway repair has been increased from $1,500,000 to $6,000,000 due, no
                            doubt, in part to the use of structural steel and in part to the fact
                            that the Highway has deteriorated considerably since the first report
                            was made. The original detailed Cuban estimate of $1,500,000 was
                            submitted about October 1940; of this $660,000 was allocated for
                            resurfacing. <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0263"/>Secondary roads,
                            originally $4,000,000, now increased to $6,000,000. Country roads
                            originally $5,000,000, now reduced to $2,000,000. This last item our
                            commission felt to be very important in order that Cuba might have some
                            all season access to agricultural areas over solid roads, even though
                            not hard-surfaced. This construction of country roads would require very
                            little imported material but would provide much employment.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Irrigation:</hi> There has been very little change; the
                            original appropriation was $2,350,000 and is now $2,000,000. However,
                            progress is still very slow. Mr. Vetter,<note n="6" xml:id="d229fn6"
                                >Carl P. Vetter.</note> the United States engineer who has been
                            employed by the Export-Import Bank and by Fomento to supervise these
                            projects, has not as yet obtained adequate assistance for carrying out
                            his work.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Refrigerators:</hi> The six were originally estimated
                            to cost $500,000, but have now been increased to $1,500,000. This is a
                            very high cost and a large increase, considering that present plans are
                            for only 14 percent more space than the original project. These
                            refrigerated warehouses were to be used primarily for storing black
                            beans (to prevent insect infestation) and for potatoes and onions. We
                            have always maintained that refrigeration for dry beans is not
                            necessary, economical or adequate. However, some refrigerated space in
                            outlying areas is needed for potatoes and onions and some could possibly
                            also be used for dairy products.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Farm Equipment:</hi> Originally recommended $1,200,000
                            but now $500,000. Under war conditions, it is obviously correct to
                            reduce sharply. Almost any specified quantity of machinery, if used in
                            the United States, would contribute more to the war effort than if used
                            in poorly organized Cuban production. Furthermore, it would be cheaper
                            for the United States, and more effective, if we paid higher prices
                            immediately for the products we want from Cuba than it would be to
                            supply machinery to Cuba.</p>
                        <p>The following projects originally recommended are now not included at
                            all:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Research:</hi> Originally $600,000 was recommended for
                            agricultural research, about ⅚ of which was for the 5 year operation of
                            general, democratic, research foundation to which all major industries
                            would be made to contribute. About ⅙was recommended for banana research.
                            Although all of this is not immediately requisite to winning the war, I
                            believe it is probably more important than some of the other projects.
                            Something must be done in the field of agricultural research.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Reforestation:</hi> Originally $730,000 was strongly
                            recommended to provide employment and to get started on vital and
                            permanent reforestation. <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0264"/>Plans
                            have been prepared by the Cuban forestry people, but Fomento has left
                            them cold. Meanwhile, charcoal and lumber prices rise and Cuba has to
                            import more lumber than it exports.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Warehouses:</hi> Not refrigerated. Originally $100,000,
                            intended for storing corn and such products in rural areas.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Rural Rehabilitation:</hi> Originally $3,000,000.
                            Recommended with the proviso that the work would be started slowly under
                            trained technicians from the United States. Obviously this may well be
                            delayed during the war, although a beginning should be made on a small
                            scale.</p>

                            indicating that the War Production Board, having studied the projects
                            and discussed them with Ing. Montoulieu, is prepared to grant ratings
                            which will permit the work to be undertaken. Certain of the most
                            critical items will have to be deferred, but Montoulieu is satisfied
                            that these can be worked into a satisfactory schedule of operations. I

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Pierson</hi>: Reference is made to
                            discussions between officers of the Department and of the Export-Import
                            Bank regarding the procedure to be followed in financing the
                            rehabilitation of the Habana waterworks.</p>
                        <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0265"/>
                        <p>As you know the residents of Habana are most anxious that this project be
                            carried out as soon as possible, and the Department believes that it
                            would represent a very useful and worthwhile civic improvement. The
                            Department is therefore pleased to learn that officers of the Bank in
                            their recent conversations with the Mayor of Habana and Dr. José E.
                                Gorrin<note n="8" xml:id="d231fn8">Partner in the law firm of
                                Rosales, Gorrin y Mañas.</note> have been able to work out a
                            tentative plan under which the project can go forward.</p>
                        <p>The Department has carefully considered the proposed plan, which provides
                            in brief for the extension of a credit to a local Cuban nonprofit
                            corporation to be organized by the Municipality of Habana, all the stock
                            of which would be endorsed in blank and delivered to the Export-Import
                            Bank, and to which the Municipality would assign the present waterworks
                            system and all appurtenances, as well as an irrevocable right to
                            exclusive use of the revenues therefrom and to which the Municipality
                            would grant an operating concession for the life of the credit.</p>
                        <p>In view of the political difficulties involved in attempting to secure
                            the guarantee of the National Government to the credit, as well as the
                            delay and possible indefinite postponement of the starting of the
                            project which would result from any such attempt, the Department does
                            not believe that it would be advisable to insist upon such a guarantee
                            at this time, especially as the Department feels that the alternative

                        <p>A–1221. Amadeo López Castro has called on me with a representative of the

                            position to award on short notice contracts for the reconstruction of
                            the Central Highway. Before doing so however the Cuban Government seeks
                            assurances from us that certain materials and supplies (mentioned below)
                            will be available in the minimum amounts required and over the necessary
                            periods. López Castro states that informal assurances in the premises
                            were given to him in Washington, adding that obviously there would be no
                            purpose in the American Government’s offering to underwrite the project
                            and to provide machinery unless we are also prepared to furnish fuel, et
                            cetera.</p>

                        <p>The Comisión de Fomento, in collaboration with the consulting engineer,
                            has prepared the following statement of requirements: <list>

                                <item>500,000 gallons of gasoline for use of 300 trucks. This amount
                                    will suffice for the entire reconstruction job, and would be
                                    consumed at the rate of approximately 35,000 gallons per month
                                    on the average. The possibility was discussed of substituting
                                    carburante from locally produced alcohol and this requirement is
                                    under urgent study between the Embassy and ORPA.<note n="10"

                                <item>1,000 tires to be delivered at the rate of one-third every

                                    the contracts. (López Castro spoke of “within one month of the
                                    award”.) This is also under study with ORPA and the Agenda de
                                    Importación y Exportación, on the basis of supplying these tires
                                    from the estimates of supply for the third and subsequent
                                    quarters, and having in mind the possibility of supplying at
                                    least a part of the tire requirements by the local factory.
                                    Maximum conservation of tires could be secured using a procedure
                                    such as that developed by the Metals Reserve Company at Santiago

                                <item>Asphalt. López Castro states that he was assured in Washington
                                    several months ago, at the time the asphalt-spreading machinery
                                    was under discussion, that the necessary supply would be made
                                    available. He states that local asphalt cannot be used for this
                                    purpose, and the Embassy’s information confirms this. Because of
                                    the difficulty of handling asphalt by tanker (according to the
                                    consulting engineer this was tried and proved to be
                                    impracticable at the Guantánamo Naval Station) and the
                                    difficulty if not impossibility of shipping liquid asphalt by
                                    tank car via Seatrain, López Castro desires to import heavy
                                    petroleum to be processed by the Standard Oil Refinery at
                                    Habana, the gasoline and gas oil by-product (only very small
                                    relative amounts of which would be obtainable) to be deducted
                                    from the regular Cuban quota, as was done with the by-product of
                                    asphalt production by that company for our Army airport at San
                                    Julián.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>López Castro believes that the gasoline, tires, and asphalt should be
                            separate from, and if necessary in addition to Cuba’s regular quota—that
                            is, that they shall be on a war essential basis.</p>
                        <p>As indicated above, I shall submit detailed reports on the three
                            requirement schedules at a very early date. In view of the urgency of
                            the matter and the fact that the Cuban Government is understandably
                            anxious to get to work on this project as quickly as possible (having in
                            mind also the dead-season and its utility in providing employment) I
                            should appreciate it if the Department would give preferred attention to
                            the problem and if possible indicate, in advance of the receipt of the
                            detailed studies, its general attitude toward 1) the possibility of
                            treating the requirements on an urgent basis, and 2) the proposition
                            that these supplies should be ex-quota.</p>

                            been possible to bring Cuba’s nonessential fuel oil consumption down to
                            the 40 percent figure.<note n="12" xml:id="d234fn12">Forty percent of

                            requirements of asphalt total 6,500,000 gallons, for the production of
                            which approximately 230,000 barrels of heavy fuel oil are required. If
                            this quantity of 230,000 barrels is not supplied outside of Cuba’s
                            regular nonessential quota, a drop in the general allotment for all
                            other nonessential purposes would ensue from 40 to 30 percent. ORPA
                            advises that such a reduction (25%) in quota is not possible to carry
                            out and the Embassy considers it inadvisable to attempt to force such a
                            reduction. In view of these circumstances and having in mind also the
                            statement in the Department’s telegram No. 44 of January 9, 1943 to the
                            effect that “The Department has informally indicated to the Cuban
                            Commission that adequate asphalt supplies are likely to be made

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nufer</hi>: Following your instructions I have
                            very carefully gone over the whole file in the matter of the Havana
                            Waterworks, and have specially scrutinized the draft of the agreement
                            between the Corporation and Export-Import Bank; the concession from the
                                <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0269"/>Municipality to the
                            Corporation and the Instrument discharging the outstanding first and
                            second mortgages on the Havana Waterworks.</p>
                        <p>My examination and scrutiny have been limited to finding any loopholes in
                            the main instruments (agreement and concession) which might give the
                            remotest chance of graft, sinecures, etc.</p>
                        <p>I find that these instruments, from a legal viewpoint, are admirably
                            drafted and certainly are the most effective way of putting through this
                            negotiation in light of the present provisions of law, removing
                            therefrom any possibility of intervention or tampering by
                            politicians.</p>
                        <p>The concession turns over the whole Havana Aqueduct, its management and
                            reconstruction, and the obtaining financing therefor, to the
                            Corporation, and I see no way in which, once this concession has been
                            legally and effectively granted, the politicians can have further
                            intervention in the affair. This, of course, is provided the concession
                            is granted in the specific terms set forth in the draft instrument
                            containing the same.</p>
                        <p>The agreement between the Corporation and the Municipality closely
                            follows the terms of the concession granted to the Corporation and
                            provides further safeguards as to expenditures of monies, appointments
                            of contractors and sub-contractors, disposition of funds, etc. The very
                            close check placed on the whole construction work by the Engineer
                            Supervisor and the fiscalization of expenditures and accounting by the
                            Contador Interventor make it very difficult for any monies to be used
                            for purposes other than those for which they are meant.</p>
                        <p>I can see nowhere any semblance of a loophole to permit graft or
                            “botellas”, because the politicians, once the concession is granted to
                            the Company, have nothing further to say in the matter. The fact that
                            the plan is so fool-proof is precisely why it has met with opposition on
                            the part of those who could and would like to profit by the usual
                            methods in vogue here in public works projects.</p>

                            rehabilitation of the waterworks system of the City of Havana, Cuba, in
                            a sum not to exceed $15,000,000.</p>
                        <p>The project to which your letter has reference is one upon which the
                            Export-Import Bank has been working for several years. We have
                            practically reached an agreement as to the terms and conditions of the
                            proposed financing. These naturally involve certain commitments
                            regarding engineering and supervisory services. Mayor Menocal plans to
                            visit us within the next few days for the purpose of arranging the final
                            details.</p>
                        <p>The Export-Import Bank has always sought to supplement rather than
                            supplant private capital and we will be glad to have the financing of
                            the rehabilitation of the Havana Waterworks supplied by private sources,
                            provided such financing is upon satisfactory terms and conditions. In
                            view, however, of the present status of this particular commitment and
                            the obligations which have been incurred in connection therewith, it
                            naturally follows that any modification of the arrangements at this late
                            date must receive the approval of the authorities of the Municipality of
                            Havana.</p>
                        <p>We will refer your letter to Mayor Menocal promptly upon his arrival.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Duggan</hi>: The Habana waterworks proposition
                            poses a rather difficult problem. The Export-Import Bank has, I
                            understand, been willing to finance this project provided adequate legal
                            and practical guarantees were set up. However, after several years of
                            discussions between representatives of the Bank and of the municipality,
                            to some extent also involving the two Governments, the municipality has
                            now apparently decided to make a deal with the Canadian American
                            Company.…</p>
                        <p>It does not seem to me that we can interfere officially or unofficially
                            in this matter at this time in the sense of advising the Cubans for or
                            against the proposition. However, I do think that it might be advisable
                            to convey to President Batista the thought that if this enterprise is
                            undertaken on the basis of private financing it will not necessarily be
                            possible for the Export-Import Bank to be of assistance should the
                            private financing prove inadequate. It would therefore seem of the very
                            greatest importance that before any binding commitments are entered
                            into, the Cuban Government make absolutely certain that they are making
                            a contract with a responsible group and not signing an instrument which
                            that group will later try to peddle around as a speculation.<note n="20"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Supplementing the Embassy’s air mail
                            despatch No. 5205 of November 22, 1943<note n="21" xml:id="d239fn21">Not
                                printed.</note> (file No. 851), and previous correspondence in the
                            matter, I have the honor to report that according to Treasury sources,
                            the proceeds from the taxes established by Law No. 31 of November 22,
                            1941, for the service of the $25,000,000 Export-Import Bank credit,
                            which became effective on January 1, 1942, totalled 12,237,511 pesos
                            during the first two years of their existence. Of these collections,
                            10.5 million pesos which were in excess of loan service requirements
                            were transferred to the 1942 and 1943 regular Cuban budgets.</p>
                        <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0273"/>
                        <p>On the basis of present estimates as to the size of the 1944 Cuban sugar
                            crop, it is expected that collections from the taxes under reference
                            will exceed 7,000,000 pesos during 1944. If so, total collections for
                            the years 1942 to 1944 will exceed 19,000,000 pesos, or over 75 percent
                            of the entire credit.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, the question is frequently raised, especially
                            in the opposition press, why the Cuban Government did not undertake the
                            several public works and agricultural diversification projects to be
                            executed from the proceeds from the $25,000,000 credit out of current
                            income, instead of saddling the Cuban people with an increase in Cuba’s
                            foreign indebtedness. While this question is a logical one under the
                            circumstances, it could, of course, hardly be foreseen in 1941 that
                            economic conditions in Cuba would improve so materially and that the
                            taxes would therefore produce the very large revenues collected to date.
                            Moreover, according to the Embassy’s observations the rank and file of
                            the Cuban people doubtless prefer to have the projects executed under
                            the safeguards established by the Export-Import Bank (regardless of the
                            resultant increase in Cuba’s foreign debt), in view of the assurance
                            that the money will be spent for the purposes for which it is intended.
                            They realize that had the Government undertaken the execution of the
                            projects out of current income, only a fraction of the money
                            appropriated would, in keeping with the usual practice, probably have
                            been spent thereon, and the benefits which Cuba’s economy would have
                            derived therefrom would at best have been problematical.</p>

                        <p>In Foreign Office note No. 1124, which deals with the Embassy’s request
                            for tax exemption in the case of War Shipping Administration vessels,
                            the Embassy’s attention is called to a letter from the Minister of
                                Finance<note n="27" xml:id="d240fn29">José Miguel Irisarri; letter
                                not printed.</note> Attached thereto in which he expresses the
                            opinion that as the taxes in question, namely, the 2.65 percent tax on
                            the gross freight and passenger earnings and the 3.60 percent tax on
                            gross income derived from freight and passenger charges, constitute
                            important sources of revenue, it would not be advisable to suspend their
                            collection. He also points out that of the 2.65 percent tax, 1.25
                            percent is pledged to the public debt service and therefore cannot, in
                            his opinion, be suspended legally (The Department will recall that
                            similar arguments were advanced by the Cuban Government at the time
                            exemption from this particular tax, known as the gross sales tax, was
                            sought on behalf of the Nicaro Nickel Company and that as a result the
                            company’s attempts to obtain exemption from this tax were subsequently
                                abandoned).<note n="28" xml:id="d240fn30">The attempt was abandoned,
                                partly because the Department in August 1942 considered the Nicaro
                                Nickel Co. in Cuba to be a Cuban company and therefore deemed it
                                inadvisable to request tax exemption through diplomatic channels.
                                However, the Department in its airgram A–293 of October 27, 1942;
                                informed Ambassador Braden that a request for tax exemption might
                                properly be made for the Nicaro Nickel Company for the reason that
                                it was in fact an American corporation contributing to the joint war
                                aims of the two nations (837.512/650). The Ambassador requested this
                                exemption in a formal note, No. 148 of January 29, 1943, <ref
                                    target="#pg_263">p. 263</ref>.</note> It will be noted that in
                            spite of the Minister of Finance’s recommendations, the Minister of
                            State, in Foreign Office note No. 1124, informs the Embassy that studies
                            are being <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0275"/>made in order to
                            ascertain to what extent the national economy would suffer from the
                            elimination of the taxes under reference so that, if it were found that
                            the attendant loss of revenue would not be too severe, steps to accede
                            to the Embassy’s request could be taken.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Office note No. 1125 deals with the sought-for general exemption
                            from taxes on all undertakings of our Government in Cuba and to the
                            request for exemption from taxes on the local operations of the Metals
                            Reserve Company. As in the case of note No. 1124, note No: 1125 is based
                            on a letter from the Minister of Finance, Attached thereto, in which he
                            expresses the opinion that our requests might be considered insofar as
                            they refer to taxes assessed on official agencies of our Government or
                            on articles or products to be used in defense projects by private
                            contractors or to taxes which they (the contractors) may pass on
                            (presumably to such official agencies of our Government). It is the
                            Minister of Finance’s opinion, however, that it would not be proper to
                            exempt from existing taxes the earnings and profits of the contractors
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of State has interpreted the Minister of Finance’s opinion
                            in the sense that official agencies of our Government should be exempted
                            from all taxes and, in accordance with the last paragraph of note No.
                            1125, instructions are being issued to the Ministry of Finance to
                            prepare a decree granting tax exemption to the operations in Cuba of the
                            Metals Reserve Company as sought for in the Embassy’s note No. 847 and
                            to undertake a study with a view toward granting the general tax
                            exemption referred to in the Embassy’s note No. 811.</p>
                        <p>Note No. 1125 appears satisfactorily to settle the tax problem of the
                            Metals Reserve Company, and Mr. George W. Tower, the representative of
                            that Government agency in Cuba, has been so informed. It also appears to
                            accept, at least in principle, our contention that all undertakings of
                            the United States Government in Cuba should be exempted from taxation
                            when the tax is levied on a defense project whether carried on by an
                            agency of our Government or by a private contractor for governmental
                            account; when the project is financed and controlled by the Government
                            of the United States for a public purpose; and when the burden of the
                            tax would fall upon the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>The apparent unwillingness of the Cuban Government to extend such
                            exemption to the earnings or profits of private contractors engaged in
                            the execution of Government projects would not appear substantially to
                            detract from the value of the concession which it seems disposed to
                            grant, but the Department’s views and comments in connection with this
                            particular phase of the matter would be appreciated.</p>
                        <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0276"/>
                        <p>Inasmuch as the War Shipping Administration is an official agency of our
                            Government, there appears to be a discrepancy between note No. 1124, in
                            which it is stated that exemption from taxation in the case of vessels
                            owned by or chartered to that agency will be considered favorably only
                            if the resulting decrease in revenues is not too severe, and note No.
                            1125, in which it is admitted that all official agencies of our
                            Government should be exempted from taxes and, in fact, thus specifically
                            exempting the operations of the Metals Reserve Company. The Embassy has
                            not as yet brought this apparent discrepancy to the attention of the
                            Cuban Government and before doing so it would appreciate receiving the
                            Department’s further instruction. In issuing such instructions, the
                            Department may wish to consider the arguments advanced by the Minister
                            of Finance that the suspension of the 3.60 and 2.65 per cent taxes would
                            substantially curtail Cuban revenues and that of the 2.65 per cent tax,
                            1.25 per cent is pledged to the service of Cuba’s foreign debt. It may
                            also wish to consider the fact that any substantial reduction in
                            revenues would increase Cuba’s budgetary difficulties proportionately
                            and might well result in Cuba’s having to look to us for financial
                            assistance in order to eke out its budgetary revenues. Moreover, the
                            Cuban Government, although it has not done so, could allege with some
                            justification that the vessels owned by or chartered to the War Shipping
                            Administration are more or less the same vessels which, privately owned,
                            previously plied between United States and Cuban ports, so that the
                            activities of the War Shipping Administration, unlike those of the
                            Metals Reserve Company, the Nicaro Nickel Company, etc., have not,
                            strictly speaking, made any additional contribution to Cuba’s economy.
                            In other words, while tax exemptions in respect of the Metals Reserve
                            Company, the Nicaro Nickel Company, etc., would merely deprive Cuba of
                            additional tax revenue, tax exemption in respect of the operations of
                            the War Shipping Administration would deprive Cuba of income which has
                            in the past constituted a substantial part of its budgetary
                            revenues.</p>

                        <p>I have from the beginning seen no justice in seeking exemption from
                            taxation by the Cuban Government on operations of a commercial nature
                            which, as an incident to the war, are carried on by a United States
                            Government agency. The mere fact that most or all United States vessels
                            in the Cuban trade are operated by and in behalf of the War Shipping
                            Administration, does not justify asking the Cuban Government to
                            surrender through taxation exemption a source of normal public
                            revenue.</p>
                        <p>Plausible reasons might be adduced for seeking exemptions from certain
                            types of taxes on United States Government officials working in Cuba on
                            war enterprises, and on materials intended to develop war production.
                            However, even here a line must be drawn between what would be normal
                            commercial expansion to meet war demands, and expansion solely as a
                            result of United States Government initiative and capital. Even in the
                            latter case I would see no justice in seeking exemptions from taxes and
                            levies of a Social Security nature.</p>
                        <p>In a nutshell, I cannot see how a foreign government can be expected to
                            give up normal sources of revenue merely because the United States

                            the general question of tax exemption to be accorded United States
                            undertakings <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0278"/>in Cuba. As
                            pointed out in my note No. 811 of November 2, 1942,<note n="32"
                                xml:id="d242fn32">Not printed.</note> the Government of the United
                            States has consistently maintained that, in accordance with the
                            recognized principles of international law, foreign governments should
                            not be taxed on their personal property in the United States devoted to
                            governmental purposes and exemption from taxation has therefore been
                            granted to plant equipment and supplies used for the production of war
                            materials by private American companies whose operations are financed
                            and controlled by foreign governments. Your Excellency’s Government
                            would appear to have established a similar principle as evidenced by
                            communication No. 2967 of November 11, 1942<note n="32"
                                xml:id="d242fn33">Not printed.</note> from His Excellency the
                            Minister of Hacienda, a copy of which was enclosed with Your
                            Excellency’s note No. 1125.</p>
                        <p>By agreement and decree of Your Excellency’s Government, the gross sales
                            tax of 2.65% has not been charged the United States Government projects
                            at San Antonio de los Baños, Metals Reserve Corporation stockpile
                            operations at Santiago de Cuba, and certain other similar projects. This
                            tax has, however, been collected on the project which is being carried
                            out by the Nicaro Nickel Company at Preston for the United States
                            Government. Funds for the acquisition and equipment of the plant at
                            Preston are being supplied by the United States Government and,
                            therefore, any Cuban taxes assessed and collected on this project must
                            be paid by the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>In view of the principles set forth in Your Excellency’s above-mentioned
                            correspondence and of the practice established in connection with other
                            United States Government projects in Cuba, I am sanguine that Your
                            Excellency’s Government will find it possible to exempt the Nicaro
                            Nickel Company development from the 2.65% gross sales tax, whether the
                            work is done by the Nicaro Nickel Company itself, by the Frederick Snare

                            the Department’s formal request of Cuba to discontinue the collection of

                        <p>I. As you will recall, the Department’s request was set out in

                            1567 of November 20, 1942. That reply reads in part: <quote

                        <p>The matter is thus being considered by Cuba apparently not on the basis
                            of law but with a view to their national economy. Certain calculations

                        <p>The Department’s position is based on the well recognized principle of
                            international practice (which in the United States is evidenced by

                        <p>The Bureau of Internal Revenue informs this office that the following
                            Latin American countries now grant equivalent exemption of taxes on
                            revenues derived from the operation of ships by citizens of the United
                            States: Argentina, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay, Uruguay and
                            Venezuela. Before the present war certain European countries also
                            granted the exemption, among them being Belgium, Poland, Denmark,
                            France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Irish Free State, Italy, Norway,
                            Sweden and Switzerland.</p>
                        <p>Section 116 (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) of the Internal Revenue Code,
                            which is declaratory of international law, is the statutory authority
                            for the full exemptions granted to foreign countries, while both foreign

                        <p>II. The legal basis for this Government’s position concerning exemption
                            from taxes on other United States Government activities in Cuba is set
                            out in the first paragraph of the Department’s airgram A–293 of October
                            27, 1942 which reads: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                <p>“The Department has consistently maintained that, in accordance

                        <p>III. Commenting on the Department’s position regarding tax relief in
                            Cuba, you conclude in your memorandum thus: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In a nutshell, I cannot see how a foreign government can be
                                    expected to give up normal sources of revenue merely because the
                                    United States replaces private initiative for war
                                purposes.”</p></quote></p>
                        <p>If Cuba will recognize her obligation under international law, the
                            revenue under consideration while derived from “normal sources” will
                            nevertheless be entitled to the exemptions requested.</p>
                        <p>IV. As formal representations have already been made to the Cuhan
                            Government (no. 754 of October 8, 1942 and airgram no. A–293 of October

                            group still pending, is this office to understand that your memorandum
                            of January 21, 1943 with notations by Mr. Bonsai and Mr. Feis is to be
                            regarded as a change or reversal of the Department’s present position,

                                    the operations of the vessels of the War Shipping Administration
                                    should seriously prejudice the stability of Cuban finances other
                                    means might well be used to grant the necessary emergency
                                    assistance which would not involve any prejudice to this
                                    Government’s rights or legal position. The calculations as to
                                    the amount of tax which the War Shipping Administration’s letter

                                    contains makes it appear that the sacrifice by Cuba will not be
                                    as great as had been previously estimated. This calculation
                                    brought to the attention of the Cuban Government, in conjunction
                                    with its statement with its own calculations as to the burden of
                                    the tax (Cuban Foreign Office’s note no. 1124 of November 17,

                                    might well bring the Cuban Government into agreement with us

                                <item>I believe that the request of the War Shipping Administration
                                    for the tax exemption is proper and should be supported. It is

                                <p>It is a well recognized principle of international law that the
                                    revenues of foreign governments should be exempted from the
                                    payment of taxes. This is recognized not only in our own law and

                                    principle is involved going far beyond the present instance of
                                    War Shipping Administration vis-à-vis Cuba. It is obvious that
                                    without the establishment and constant safeguarding of this

                                    handicapped. These and other agencies of our Government conduct
                                    operations in an ever increasing number of foreign
                                    jurisdictions. For them to be subject to taxation by each
                                    country through which the goods might pass or where the
                                    operations are being conducted, would result in an impossible
                                    situation: the multiplication of costs and the restrictions of
                                    many governments’ regulations. Compared to this the narrow and
                                    limited Cuban budgetary considerations are decidedly
                                    secondary.</p>
                                <p>While it is true that the War Shipping Administration is
                                    conducting a function under the aegis of Government authority
                                    which in normal times would have been a matter of ordinary
                                    business and commercial transaction, the answer is that the
                                    Defense Supplies Corporation, the Export-Import Bank, the
                                    Agricultural Marketing Administration, the Commodity Credit
                                    Corporation, and other agencies of the Government are entering
                                    fields and are conducting negotiations in realms which in normal
                                    times, or in peace times, or in earlier times, were considered
                                    to be the businessman’s sphere. Obviously, this Government on
                                    principle could not permit the operations, the property and the
                                    functions of these agencies to be subjected to such local
                                    taxation abroad as would subject them to alien control and

                                    by the Cuban Treasury. The War Shipping Administration estimates
                                    that the suspension of the taxes would amount to a decrease in
                                    revenues of a sum less than $160,000. (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                                    The amount of loss in revenue is comparatively insignificant,

                                    maintenance, and its assistance in the sugar industry and in a
                                    variety of other ways, more than makes up for the comparatively
                                    slight decrease in revenues represented by the figure cited

                                    States and other belligerent Governments, has found some new and
                                    additional sources of tax revenue, and may find it necessary to
                                    increase the rates and amounts of taxes already imposed. That is
                                    a part of the cost of war. (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) It is not
                                    the function or the purpose of the War Shipping Administration
                                    to conduct its operations in such a way as to underwrite
                                    governmental budgets and estimates of revenues made by other
                                    countries. When and if that purpose is intended we have other
                                    ways of accomplishing the purpose; and it can be done without
                                    yielding on legal points which would have embarrassing and
                                    costly results in our relations with other countries.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department has carefully considered
                            your despatch no. 1567 of November 20, 1942 concerning the general
                            question of tax exemption on United States Government undertakings in
                            Cuba.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office Note No. 1124 concerning exemption from taxes on
                            earnings in Cuba of the War Shipping Administration transmits a copy of
                            an opinion of the Ministry of Finance dated November 9, 1942, holding
                            that the $3.60 tax (on freight or passenger earnings) forms an important
                            factor in the country’s income at the present time and that it therefore
                            would not be advisable for the Treasury to suspend it; while the $2.65
                            tax is (on gross income) pledged, $1.25 to the service of foreign
                            obligations, which cannot be legally suspended, and $1.40 being an
                            Internal Revenue measure “which it would not be advisable for the
                            Treasury to suspend”. Notwithstanding the opinion of the Minister of
                            Finance, the Foreign Office Note No. 1124 states “that calculations are
                            being made in order to ascertain to what extent the national economy
                            would be prejudiced by the possible suppression of these taxes, so that
                            in case it would not appreciably affect collections, the request [of the
                            Embassy] may be granted”. It may, in the Embassy’s discretion, be
                            advisable to await the result of the calculations referred to, and
                            should this be the case, the Embassy may seek a favorable opportunity to
                            press for an early determination of these calculations.</p>
                        <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0285"/>
                        <p>Your note to the Foreign Office, No. 731, of October 15, 1942,<note
                                n="52" xml:id="d245fn52">Not printed.</note> is a clear statement of
                            the Department’s position on the principle of law involved. An added
                            argument for the exemption requested is the fact that the War Shipping
                            Administration is an agency of this Government and the present request
                            falls well within sub-paragraph (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of the
                            communication of the Minister to Foreign Office Note No. 1125 of
                            November 17, 1942). The concluding paragraph of this communication
                            reads, “It does not, however, seem just that the contractor be exempted
                            from taxes on profits or earnings, since even though the work may be for
                            defense purposes, not only does it seem fitting that individuals should
                            contribute from their earnings in the state in which they are derived
                            toward defraying its expenses, but it would, in fact, be extremely
                            unjust to exempt them, while other private enterprises, precisely
                            because of the war, see their earnings and margins of profit dwindle
                            from day to day”.</p>
                        <p>The Department assumes that this paragraph covers both individuals and
                            corporations of American and foreign nationality who act as contractors
                            and subcontractors for this Government on defense projects. The term
                            “profits or earnings” may lend itself to confusion in interpretation.
                            What, if any, application would the Cuban income tax law have on the
                            groups indicated in this paragraph?</p>
                        <p>Having these observations in mind, the Department feels that you should
                            request of the Foreign Office a clarification of the paragraph above
                            quoted. The Department transmits, for your information and comment, a
                            copy of a letter dated January 4, 1943<note n="52" xml:id="d245fn53">Not
                                printed.</note> from the War Shipping Administration. You will
                            observe that the figure $320,000 is given as the tax collections which
                            would be realized on earnings from May 1942 to December 1942, but as a
                            result of Cuban Government Decree No. 2602, it is estimated that this
                            figure could probably be cut by more than 50 percent. In view of the
                            relatively small amount involved and the desirability of maintaining the
                            important principle involved, the Department feels that you might use
                            the information set forth by the War Shipping Administration to
                            advantage in your efforts to accelerate the conclusion of the
                            calculations mentioned above.</p>

                            Excellency’s distinguished predecessor’s courteous note No. 1124 of
                            November 14, 1942, with which was enclosed a letter from the Minister of
                            Finance addressed to the Prime Minister<note n="54" xml:id="d246fn54"
                                >Rameón Zaydln.</note> with regard to my Government’s request that
                            the earnings of vessels either owned by or chartered to the War Shipping
                            Administration be exempted from the 2.75 per cent tax established by
                            Article III of Military Order No. 423 of 1900, as amended by Article XV
                            of the Law of July 6, 1928; by the Emergency Tax Law of September 8,
                            1941; and by Law No.”7 of April 5, 1943, and from the 3.6 per cent tax
                            established by the Law of October 9, 1922, as amended by the Public
                            Works Law of July 15, 1925; Decree-Law No. 393 of November 8, 1935; a
                            decree of December 20,1939; and Decree No. 3520 of December 31,1941.</p>
                        <p>In that note Your Excellency’s predecessor stated that investigations
                            were being made in order to ascertain to what extent the economy of Cuba
                            would be prejudiced by the possible suppression of these taxes, so that
                            in case it were found that their suppression would not appreciably
                            affect revenue collections, my Government’s request might be
                            granted.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned in the Embassy’s note No. 731 of October 15, 1942, to which
                            note No. 1124 was a reply, the earnings on which the tax exemptions are
                            sought are derived from the operation of three classes of vessels,
                            namely <hi rend="italic">a</hi>) those owned by the United States; <hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) those on bareboat charter to the War Shipping
                            Administration, and <hi rend="italic">c</hi>) those on time, charter to
                            the War Shipping Administration. In all these cases the vessels are
                            under the complete control of my Government, represented by the War
                            Shipping Administration, and carry only such cargo, ply on only such
                            routes and otherwise render only such services as my Government
                            determines and directs. The operations of these vessels are, of course,
                            coordinated with other essential operations of my Government and of the
                            Governments allied or cooperating with it in the prosecution of the war
                            and, therefore, in view of the existing conditions throughout the world,
                            all such services can appropriately be considered as not only public
                            services rendered in the interest of my Government, but also, to a
                            corresponding degree, as public services rendered in the interest of all
                            Governments associated in the common cause against the Axis powers.</p>
                        <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0287"/>
                        <p>It was also pointed out in the Embassy’s aforementioned note No. 731
                            that, in the opinion of my Government, the collection of the taxes under
                            reference on the earnings of vessels either owned by or chartered to the
                            War Shipping Administration constituted taxes on revenues accruing to
                            the United States, and I brought to the attention of Your Excellency’s
                            Government the fact that my Government does not collect taxes on
                            earnings in the United States derived by other Governments from the
                            operation of ships.</p>
                        <p>I might add at this time that inasmuch as the War Shipping Administration
                            is an official agency of my Government, the exemptions requested fall
                            well within sub-paragraph <hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of the communication
                            of the Minister of Finance of November 11, 1942,<note n="55"
                                xml:id="d246fn55">Note No. 2967, not printed.</note> of which a copy
                            was enclosed with Your Excellency’s predecessor’s note No. 1125 of
                            November 14, 1942, in which it was stated that consideration should be
                            given to requests for exemption from Cuban taxes when such requests were
                            made by and on behalf of official agencies of a friendly Government.</p>
                        <p>I venture to express the hope, therefore, that the investigations
                            mentioned in note No. 1124 have now been completed and that Your
                            Excellency’s Government will shortly be able to arrive at a favorable
                            decision in the matter.</p>

                            Department’s air mail instruction No. 1830 of June 19, 1943 (no file
                            number), transmitting a copy of a letter dated May 26, 1943,<note n="56"

                                the activities of the Defense Supplies Corporation covering the
                                purchase, storage, and transportation of the 1942–1943 Cuban
                                molasses crop, and the application of the taxes thereon (811.512337
                                Shipping/11).</note> from the Defense Supplies Corporation,
                            regarding its purchase of the 1942 Cuban molasses crop, and instructing
                            the Embassy to bring this letter to the attention of the Cuban
                            Government and to request a waiver of the 2.65 per cent and the 3.60 per
                            cent taxes assessed on the total ocean freight charges on all shipments
                            of molasses made by the Defense Supplies Corporation from Cuba to the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>The Department refers in this connection to the Embassy’s note No. 834 of
                            November 6, 1942,<note n="57" xml:id="d247fn57">Not printed.</note> as a
                            result of which the Cuban Government <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274"
                                facs="0288"/>issued Decree No. 14 of January 8, 1943 (not No. 140 of
                            January 9, 1943, as mentioned in the Department’s instruction No. 1830),
                            exempting sugars and molasses purchased by the Defense Supplies
                            Corporation from payment of the 2.65 per cent gross sales tax on
                            transportation, handling, storage and other charges. This decree
                            afforded the Defense Supplies Corporation a substantial measure of
                            relief from local tax charges and, in fact, the local representative of
                            the Defense Supplies Corporation has assured the Embassy that with the
                            exception of the 1 per cent railroad retirement tax (from which
                            exemption was also requested in the Embassy’s above mentioned note No.
                            834), the Defense Supplies Corporation has been exempted from all Cuban
                            state, provincial or municipal taxes on its sugar and molasses
                            operations in Cuba in accordance with Article XV of the Contract of
                            Purchase of the 1942 sugar crop entered into between the Defense
                            Supplies Corporation and the Cuban Sugar Institute.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the 1 per cent railroad retirement tax, the railroads have
                            continued their efforts to collect this tax from the Defense Supplies
                            Corporation on railroad freight charges on molasses and refined sugar
                            (raw sugar is not subject to this tax) on the ground that it is not a
                            tax but, in effect, a contribution to the Railroad Retirement Fund. The
                            representative of the Defense Supplies Corporation here tells me,
                            however, that he is not paying this tax and is contesting its
                            assessment. The Embassy proposes, therefore, in accordance with the
                            Department’s instructions, to inquire of the Foreign Office what
                            decision has been made on its request for exemption from the 1 per cent
                            railroad retirement tax on the refined sugars and molasses owned by the
                            Defense Supplies Corporation.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the main purpose of the Defense Supplies Corporation’s
                            letter, namely, the request for exemption from the 2.65 per cent and
                            3.60 per cent taxes on the total ocean freight charges on its molasses
                            shipments to the United States, there appears to be some
                            misunderstanding. These taxes are not assessed on the owners or
                            exporters of the merchandise (in this case the Defense Supplies
                            Corporation), but on the owners or operators of the vessels on which the
                            merchandise is shipped. The Cuban Government has been collecting these
                            taxes from the War Shipping Administration, which has been handling
                            practically all of the Defense Supplies Corporation’s molasses and
                            sugars, and the War Shipping Administration may have attempted to
                            recover the amount thereof from the Defense Supplies Corporation.</p>
                        <p>The Department will recall, however, that pursuant to its instructions,
                            the Embassy has been requesting the Cuban Government to exempt vessels
                            owned by or chartered to the War Shipping Administration from these
                            taxes, and that this matter was last officially brought <pb n="275"
                                xml:id="pg_275" facs="0289"/>to the Cuban Government’s attention in
                            the Embassy’s note No. 414 of April 20, 1943, of which a copy was
                            submitted to the Department with the Embassy’s despatch No. 3459 of June
                            12, 1943.<note n="58" xml:id="d247fn58">See footnote 53, <ref
                                    target="#pg_272">p. 272</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the taxes in question are assessed on and
                            collected from the ocean carriers, and as the Embassy is already
                            endeavoring to obtain exemption therefrom on behalf of the War Shipping
                            Administration, there would appear to be no grounds for further
                            representations in connection therewith on behalf of the Defense
                            Supplies Corporation, and the Embassy would appreciate receiving the
                            Department’s views in the matter.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the foregoing, the Department will doubtless recall
                            that as mentioned in the Embassy’s air mail despatch No. 3459 of June
                            12, the Prime Minister, in discussing this matter with Ambassador Braden
                            on June 4, again pointed out the substantial loss of revenue which would
                            result should the Cuban Government exempt from taxes the freight revenue
                            obtained in Cuba by the War Shipping Administration, and that he urged
                            that the matter not be pressed further. In view of the Prime Minister’s
                            comments and of the Cuban Government’s obvious reluctance to accede to
                            our repeated requests for exemption from the taxes under reference, the
                            Embassy is not overly sanguine as to the eventual outcome of its
                            representations in the matter.</p>

                            number), in which the Embassy was requested to seek from the Cuban
                            Government a clarification of the concluding paragraph of a
                            communication of the Minister of Finance dated November 11, 1942,
                            enclosed with the Cuban Government’s note No. 1125 of November 14, 1942,
                            the contents of which, it was felt, lent themselves to confusion in
                            interpretation.</p>
                        <p>There is Attached a copy of the Embassy’s note No. 415 to the Foreign

                            the statement made that it presumably is intended to cover both
                            individuals and corporations of American and <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276"

                            Cuba. The note also points out that the term “profits or income” may
                            lend itself to confusion in interpretation and inquires what, if any,
                            application the Cuban income tax would have on the groups indicated in
                            the paragraph under reference.</p>
                        <p>Although this matter has since been repeatedly brought to the attention
                            of the Cuban Government, no definitive reply has been received from the
                            Foreign Office to the Embassy’s note No. 415 mentioned above. Inquiries
                            made of the Minister of Finance by the Economic Counselor, however, have
                            elicited the Attached reply, dated July 16, 1943,<note n="60"

                        <p>No mention is made in the Minister’s letter of the other points raised in

                                Finance, and reminded Santovenia that Irisarri, in that letter, had
                                “expressed the opinion that consideration should be given to
                                requests for tax exemption received from official agencies of the
                                United States Government.” (811.512337 Shipping/16)</note> but the
                            foregoing apparently indicates that it is the Cuban Government’s
                            intention to tax, in accordance with existing fiscal legislation, the
                            “profits” and the “income” obtained from defense projects in Cuba by
                            individuals or corporations acting as contractors or sub-contractors for
                            the United States Government. As the Department is aware, the Cuban
                            “income” tax was established by Decree-Law No. 1 of December 31, 1941,
                            while the Cuban “profits” tax, with such modifications as have since
                            been made therein from time to time, has been in effect since before the
                            days of the Republic. Income and profits tax rates were substantially
                            modified by the Cuban tax Law (No. 7) of April 5, 1943; of which a copy
                            and translation were submitted to the Department with the Embassy’s

                            2971, the Embassy discussed with the Director General of Customs the
                            desirability of his office promptly transmitting telegrams to the
                            various customs authorities from which shipments of ore are customarily

                            Company Agency are exempt from taxation. The Director General of Customs
                            agreed to transmit these telegrams without delay and stated that the

                        <p>It will be noted that, in addition to the tax exemptions requested by the

                            this connection is also made to the Legation’s despatch no. 416 of
                            January 2, 1943,<note n="1" xml:id="d252fn3">Not printed.</note> which

                            milling facilities should be the primary consideration in deciding
                            whether to approve the measures necessary to enable the rice mill of the
                            Compañía Comercial to operate for the processing of the current rice
                            crop, it believes that approval of such measures under existing
                            arrangements places this Government in the unsatisfactory position of
                            agreeing that materials from this country shall assist or permit a

                            substantial part by undesirable persons.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, in view of the efforts being made to increase the production of
                            rice in the Dominican Republic, it appears entirely possible that the
                            best interests of the Dominican economy will require the employment of
                            the facilities of the Compañía Comercial rice mill during the next rice
                            harvest in June, and that this Government will again be requested to
                            approve emergency measures which will include permission for United
                            States materials to go forward to enable the mill to operate.</p>
                        <p>In view of these considerations, the Department believes that it is
                            strongly desirable to find a permanent and satisfactory solution at the
                            present time to the problem presented by the continuing
                            Nottebohm–Grossart financial interests in the Compañía Comercial and the
                            continued presence therein of Friedrich Rudolf Grossart.<note n="3"

                            not perhaps of such importance as the rice mill, the remaining property
                            of the Compañía Comercial is of some value to the Dominican economy and
                            a solution embracing all the assets of the Compañía would, therefore,
                            appear to be advantageous to the Dominican Government.</p>

                                >Not printed.</note> the Legation outlined a plan providing for the
                            vesting or forced sale of the Nottebohm-Grossart interests in the firm
                            and the deletion of the Compañía Comercial’s name from the Proclaimed
                            List. In describing its advantages, the despatch stated “the adoption of
                            this plan would be beneficial since it would entirely eliminate from the
                            firm the positively German elements. At the same time it would place
                            control over the commercial activities of Rafael Lembcke, whose
                            international political attitude is not well defined, and it would
                            enable other members of the Lembcke family, against whom the Legation
                            knows nothing prejudicial, to maintain their holdings in the Compañía
                            Comercial without further loss due to its inclusion on the Proclaimed
                            List. In addition the United States and British Governments would be
                            removed from the paradoxical position of attempting to restrict the
                            production of food products on land owned by the Compañía Comercial,
                            when both are <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0296"/>interested in the
                            production of food crops. Furthermore, they would be removed from the
                            position of attempting to restrict production on this land when they
                            cannot successfully do so, thereby weakening the prestige and general
                            effect of the Proclaimed List”<note n="5" xml:id="d252fn6"

                        <p>The Department will appreciate receiving a report as promptly as possible
                            concerning the reasons for the statement of the Dominican officials that
                            the vesting or forced sale of enemy interests in a case such as this is
                            undesirable. The report should include a statement concerning each of
                            the following points: (1) administrative difficulties which may be
                            believed to lie in the way of satisfactory vesting; (2) the availability
                            of private capital owned by desirable persons for the purchase of the
                            Nottebohm-Grossart interests by forced sale; (3) the availability of a
                            manager capable of replacing Friedrich Rudolf Grossart.</p>

                        <p>A–248. Department’s instruction no. 310, January 27, 1943. After receipt

                            Dominican Government officials regarding possible action with regard to
                            vesting or forced sale of enemy interests. On February 19, an informal
                            memorandum was given to the Secretary of State for the Presidency,<note

                        <p>Responsible government officials give their objections to vesting or
                            forced sale, particularly as applying to the Compañía Comercial, as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>The Dominican Government has not had experience in vesting, preferring
                            instead to use the procedure of intervention. It was pointed out that,
                            in actual practice, the interventor exercises the same authority and
                            control, with the exception of the power to dispose of the enterprise,
                            that he would have if the property were vested in him or in the
                            Government. The Dominican Government does not wish to assume ownership
                            of a firm now on the Proclaimed List and states <pb n="283"
                                xml:id="pg_283" facs="0297"/>that there are no private parties with
                            available capital who are interested in purchase of the
                            Nottebohm–Grossart interests. They therefore believe that the
                            intervention procedure offers all the advantages of vesting and is in
                            addition a measure with which they are well acquainted. Only 680 of the
                            1500 shares in the Cía. Comercial are held by German interests and the
                            Dominican Government believes that the present control affecting the
                            entire company is preferable to one affecting only a minority of the
                            shares.</p>
                        <p>Rafael Lembcke (who is a National Deputy) has stated that Grossart would
                            be glad to relinquish his position as president of the company and it is
                            probable that the former would assume that place. Since active
                            management is under the supervision of interventor, however, Grossart’s
                            replacement is considered by Dominican authorities as necessary only if
                            vesting or forced sale should take place. There are considerations of
                            local politics, neither anti-American nor pro-Nazi, that require careful
                            handling of this particular situation.</p>

                            indicated its approval. It is being taken to Quito by Mr. Clark Byse of
                            the BEW, who took an active part in drawing it up. Mr. Byse left by
                            plane Wednesday afternoon, January 6, for Quito.</p>
                        <p>The Department agreed to the proposal from BEW that Mr. Byse go to Quito
                            at this time, due to our feeling that he could be of help to the Embassy
                            in the negotiations for the over-all agreement and for <pb n="285"
                                xml:id="pg_285" facs="0299"/>the agreement between Supplies and the
                            Development Corporation. While he has been authorized by Defense
                            Supplies to approve such amendments to the above-mentioned documents as
                            may be necessary, such authorization, of course, does not give him
                            authority to negotiate. Defense Supplies Corporation understands fully
                            the Department’s position that negotiations are in the hands of the
                            Embassy. Byse’s role is limited to that of consultant to the Embassy.
                            This statement of his function supersedes any he may have received from
                            BEW or Defense Supplies. Because of Byse’s experience, however, you will
                            probably find that he can be of assistance in working out solutions to
                            pending questions.</p>

                            second is from Ibarro to Aguarico in northern Oriente. Practically
                            nothing is known about this route or about the amount of rubber in the
                            area. Norton<note n="10" xml:id="d256fn10">Presumably E. Hope Norton,

                            some rubber around Méndez and we expect to begin immediately to improve
                            the existing trail from Cuenca to facilitate exploitation. Cost of trail
                            work will be about sucres 75,000. The Minister proposes to apply for a
                            loan from Export-Import Bank to build these roads and to use premium
                            payments to pay interest on and amortize the loans. He is also
                            considering the same arrangement for road construction work in Santo
                            Domingo area. Although we doubt that the construction of roads into the
                            Oriente could be completed in time to be of value to the war program,
                            the Ecuadoran Government for political and military reasons appears to
                            be quite strongly in favor of this plan. The Minister asks that Reserve
                            arrange to have American engineers sent down to contract with the
                            Ecuadoran Government to do this road work. We have no doubt that if work
                            is to be completed within a reasonable time a good deal of equipment
                            from the United States will be necessary also.</p>

                        <p>94. Embassy’s 96, February 3. On the basis of Lowry’s description, it is
                            not apparent to the Department that the road construction proposed by
                            the Minister of Finance has direct connection with rubber production,
                            and hence it appears that premiums would not be expended “in the
                            development of the production of wild rubber” as <pb n="287"
                                xml:id="pg_287" facs="0301"/>provided in the rubber agreement. If
                            that is the case, this Government could not agree to the proposed use of
                            the premium payments. In the absence of forceful reasons for the
                            construction of these roads, it seems clear that the engineers requested
                            by the Minister could not be made available and that in any event it is
                            probable that it would be impossible to obtain the necessary
                            equipment.</p>

                            dissatisfied with the working of certain features of the rubber
                            agreement and stated that Ecuador has faithfully complied with all

                            the U. S. had met its obligations. He pointed out that in discussions
                            with Ecuadoreans he defended the U. S. but there are three points
                            concerning which he was dissatisfied: (1) Tires have not been shipped to
                            Ecuador as provided in the agreement. No tires have been received from
                            Brazil as yet covering the quota for the fourth quarter 1942 and first
                            quarter 1943. (2) The agreement provides for the payment of premiums to
                            the Ecuadorean Government for use in the procurement and development of
                            wild rubber. Although a specific request was made as far back as

                            rubber producing sections of the Oriente it has not been possible to
                            obtain authorization for this. (3) He also stated that he was
                            dissatisfied with the way the $500,000 development fund had been
                            utilized. However, as the conversation developed this was not again
                            mentioned and apparently this is not a very serious problem at the
                            moment. Presumably such a dissatisfaction as exists is due to the fact
                            that in nearly 10 months very little of this fund has actually been
                            spent.</p>

                        <p>After a brief discussion of difficulties which have been encountered in
                            connection with supplying tires the President stated that one serious
                            objection to receiving tires from Brazil was that these tires cost
                            Ecuador approximately 25% more than tires from the U. S. Although he
                            dropped the discussion of tires after explanations as to various
                            difficulties which have been encountered, the question of receiving
                            tires is of paramount importance and is certain to arise again. Kindly
                            inform the Embassy in detail as to the status of shipments from Brazil
                            and as to shipment of the second and third emergency stock piles.</p>
                        <p>He expressed his great dissatisfaction at not having definite
                            authorization to use the premium payments for the construction of the
                            road from Cuenca to Mendez. (Reference Embassy’s telegram No. 96,

                            It was explained that after discussions between Lowry and the Minister
                            of Finance it had been decided to request authorization up to $30,000
                            for an engineering survey of the road and that authority had recently
                            been received from Washington to spend this amount.</p>
                        <p>The President explained that the premium payments were made to the
                            Government of Ecuador to spend for projects for the development of
                            rubber. This project was of the character named and he insisted that
                            authority be granted immediately to spend the premium payments on this
                            work. He emphasized the fact that when Congress meets early in August
                            one of the first questions to be raised will be as to the uses which
                            have been made of the premium payments. Apparently he feels that the
                            political pressure for the utilization of this fund on the road
                            mentioned will be irresistible.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that although the contract has been in force since
                            last July the announcement of authorization to spend $30,000 of
                            Ecuador’s money is the first indication he has had of approval to
                            utilize these funds. He stated that it would be better not to have the
                            funds than to receive similar driblet authorizations. It was explained
                            that apparently there had been a misunderstanding since Mr. Lowry was of
                            the impression that the Minister of Finance merely desired authorization
                            for the survey in connection with the Cuenca-Mendez road. He did not
                            understand that approval for expenditure of the entire premium payments
                            on the Cuenca-Méndez road was essential.</p>
                        <p>The President ended by saying that if the Rubber Development
                                Corporation<note n="16" xml:id="d260fn16">The Rubber Reserve Company

                        <p>I consider it of the utmost importance that authorization be granted
                            immediately for spending premium payments made to date on the

                        <p>379. Embassy’s 423, May 13. While under the agreement Rubber Development
                            has no specific right to approve or disapprove application of premium
                            payments, it would have a right to object if the funds are expended
                            other than “in the development of the production of wild rubber” in
                            Ecuador. In order to avoid disagreements it seems desirable to have
                            Rubber Development concur in advance in the making of any expenditures
                            of premium payments. Because the payments are large compared to those in
                            other countries and the opportunities for spending them in increasing
                            rubber production in Ecuador are limited, Rubber Development is not
                            disposed to claim a narrow or strict interpretation of the provisions of
                            the agreement. Accordingly, while the direct connection between the
                            construction of the Cuenca-Méndez road and the production of rubber may
                            be open to question and hence Rubber Development might be justified in
                            objecting to the proposed expenditure, it has decided not to do so.</p>
                        <p>This decision has been made subject to two conditions: (1) that it shall
                            be clearly understood by the Ecuadoran Government that this Government
                            can give no undertaking to assure availability of requisite machinery
                            and equipment or engineering or other personnel and (2) construction of
                            road will not be permitted by Ecuadoran Government to draw labor which
                            would otherwise engage in rubber production.</p>
                        <p>Rubber Development’s position has not been influenced by the statement of
                            the President as to termination of the agreement. It has already agreed
                            to expenditure of $30,000 for a survey of the road and had not
                            understood that anything further was contemplated pending the outcome of
                            the survey.</p>
                        <p>Any dissatisfaction with respect to use of the $500,000 development fund
                            seems unjustified. Approval has been given by Rubber Development for
                            expenditure from the fund of over $170,000, and so far as is known here
                            few, if any, proposals chargeable against the fund have been turned
                            down.</p>

                            me a problem of some delicacy and difficulty concerning which we would
                            all like your advice. According to Illingworth, President Arroyo is
                            convinced that on the occasion of his visit to Washington<note n="19a"
                                xml:id="d263fn19a">President Arroyo visited Washington November
                                23–27, 1942.</note> he was promised by Mr. Welles<note n="20"
                                xml:id="d263fn20">Sumner Welles, Under Secretary of State.</note> a
                            $10,000,000 credit for agricultural development in Ecuador, the said
                            credit to be over and above any existing commitments. Vicente states
                            that the President has gone pretty far out on a limb in discussing this
                            more or less publicly since his return home.</p>
                        <p>I have gone into the matter very carefully. The fact is that neither Mr.
                            Welles nor anyone else discussed agricultural development in specific
                            terms with Arroyo. There was no mention whatever of any additional
                            credit. Of course, Mr. Welles and others expressed sympathetic interest
                            in Ecuadoran agricultural problems. It was suggested that should any
                            projects be developed in regard to this subject they might be processed
                            through the Ecuadoran Development Corporation which at that time
                            appeared to have ample uncommitted funds.</p>
                        <p>We will not at this time extend a further $10,000,000 credit to the
                            Ecuadoran Development Corporation. However, I would like to have your
                            views as to the local situation and as to the President’s position in
                            order that we may decide what, if anything, should be <pb n="292"
                                xml:id="pg_292" facs="0306"/>done. It seems to me, quite frankly,
                            until there is developed some sort of intelligent program for the
                            general development of Ecuadoran agriculture with particular reference
                            to production and distribution for local consumption the mere granting
                            of credit would not be desirable.</p>

                            the newspaper comment which has occurred upon this matter from time to
                            time. Although we are sending the despatch up in the regular way, a copy
                            is enclosed with this letter for your information.</p>
                        <p>Let me say, in the first place, Phil, that I can see no necessity for our
                            Government’s extending a $10,000,000 credit either to the Ecuadoran
                            Development Corporation, or to the Ecuadoran Government as such in order
                            to procure the good will of Ecuador.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, from an economic standpoint, the banks of this country are so
                            loaded down with a surplus of dollars that I personally share the
                            general view here among thinking people that further extensions of
                            credit would be harmful rather than helpful to Ecuador. This country can
                            finance its own present crop development program with its own funds and,
                            in fact, has already taken steps to do so, as you will see from the law
                            reported in despatch No. 164 of June 30,<note n="23" xml:id="d264fn24"
                                >Not reprinted</note> which provides that commercial banks are
                            required to invest 15% of their portfolio of investments in agricultural
                            loans or to rediscount paper of the Mortgage Bank of Ecuador, which
                            represents loans for agricultural purposes.</p>
                        <p>From the political point of view, I do not, frankly, believe that
                            President Arroyo has gone very far out on a limb in this matter. The
                            only discussions about it had been those in the press which are enclosed
                                herewith.<note n="24" xml:id="d264fn25">Not printed.</note> You will
                            notice that these articles do not refer to it as government credit which
                            has been promised by Washington, but <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293"
                                facs="0307"/>rather as an extension of the credit of the Development
                            Corporation. I cannot see that the refusal of our Government to extend
                            further credit would be in any way embarrassing to the President. In
                            fact, as regards the press angle, you will see from the enclosed leading
                            editorial in <hi rend="italic">El Día</hi> of yesterday, regarding the
                            reported $1,200,000 road loan, that the attitude which is taken in at
                            least one section of the press is that no more dollars are needed in
                            this country.</p>
                        <p>The President has not mentioned this subject to me in any way whatsoever
                            and, quite frankly, when the first article in the press appeared about
                            the possibility of a further $10,000,000 credit, both myself and the
                            rest of the staff were completely in a fog as to what it referred to. Of
                            course, if the President’s request is turned down, I imagine he will be
                            somewhat miffed, but I certainly do not think that his political
                            prestige here … will be in any way impaired.</p>
                        <p>Enclosed is a memorandum of a pertinent conversation on July 1<note

                        <p>This is a rather hastily written letter, Phil, as I feel that you want me
                            to answer your own letter right away. However, perhaps the general
                            atmosphere which it conveys will be helpful to you.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sumner</hi>: I have sent up in the normal way
                            my despatch No. 272 of July 21,<note n="25" xml:id="d265fn25">Not
                                printed.</note> setting forth the extreme irritation evidenced by
                            Arroyo regarding the apparent reluctance of the Rubber Development
                            Corporation to give his Government a free hand in using the premium
                            payments on rubber.</p>
                        <p>It is my understanding that the purpose back of these premium payments
                            was not only to expedite the extraction of rubber but to create a
                            certain amount of good will. As you will see from my despatch and the
                            previous correspondence about events before I arrived here, the method
                            of handling these premium payments seems to have created everything but
                            good will.</p>

                            would like to have this matter handled in accordance with Arroyo’s
                            wishes. There is no trouble on that score, therefore, and it is <pb

                                printed.</note> Lowry’s letter to Rubber Development of July
                                22.<note n="30" xml:id="d266fn30">Presumably this refers to telegram
                                No. 648, July 22, 1 p.m., in which Lowry requested information on
                                negotiations by Illingworth on the premium fund
                                (822.51/1027).</note> As outlined in Department’s telegram 379, May
                            18, it is understood here that this Government has no right under the
                            rubber agreement with Ecuador to give prior approval or disapproval of
                            expenditures of premium funds. However, under agreement with other
                            countries containing similar provisions it has been considered desirable
                            for the governments of the producing country and of this country to
                            consult in advance in order to obviate any disagreement as to whether
                            any proposed expenditure is within the terms of the agreement and hence
                            not subject to objection from us. Since Illingworth while Minister of
                            Finance had on several occasions consulted with Rubber Development
                            representatives on expenditures of premium funds it was assumed that the
                            Ecuadoran Government wished to follow a similar course, which appears
                            obviously to be designed to promote harmony in the execution of the
                            rubber agreement. Projects which may be undertaken are likely to require
                            machinery and equipment and personnel from this country, and prior
                            consultation with respect to proposed expenditures will elicit
                            information as to their availability. Moreover, in view of their
                            familiarity with the rubber program in Ecuador as a whole, Rubber
                            Development representatives should be particularly fitted to advise as
                            to the contribution which proposed projects may make to rubber
                            production. If, however, it is the wish of the Ecuadoran Government that
                            these funds should be spent without prior reference to the Embassy or
                            the Rubber Development Corporation, naturally this Government will
                            interpose no objection.</p>
                        <p>It is believed by Rubber Development that Illingworth may not have
                            understood fully the point of view of Rubber Development as outlined in
                            his conversations with its officers during his visit. Their inquiries
                            were intended to be directed solely to the questions of the relation of
                            the proposed Ibarra-Succumbios road to rubber production, <pb n="295"
                                xml:id="pg_295" facs="0309"/>of the effect of the road construction
                            on the availability of labor for actual rubber tapping, and of the
                            necessity for materials, equipment and personnel from this country. Such
                            inquiries are natural under the system of prior consultation which
                            Rubber Development understood was being followed. Mr. Illingworth’s
                            original proposal contemplated that the surveying and construction would
                            be undertaken by an United States firm, and this did not originate with
                            Rubber Development. The Export-Import Bank came into the picture only
                            because of Illingworth’s request that, after construction of the two
                            proposed roads had been mutually agreed upon, Rubber Development should
                            agree to permit the pledge of premium funds paid and to be paid to
                            guarantee the interest on and amortization of a loan from the
                            Export-Import Bank to finance the cost of construction of the
                            Cuenca-Méndez and Ibarra-Succumbios roads.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that you confer with the President along the lines of the
                            foregoing, with which Rubber Development concurs. Please keep Lowry
                            fully informed.</p>

                            felt that the Agreement should be canceled and Ecuadoran producers be

                                Development Corporation but that since the analysis showed less than
                                two per cent the bark had been rejected. He also stated that the
                                Corporation had refused to release the bark in order that Mr.
                                [Heredia?] Crespo might be free to dispose of it as he saw fit. He
                                also indicated that Mr. Crespo had received offers from Argentina
                                and that the action of the Development Corporation was seriously
                                prejudicing the very substantial investment which Senator Heredia
                                had made.</item>

                            <item>The President then called attention to paragraph 2 (<hi
                                    rend="italic">a</hi>) (vii) which provides for the establishment
                                within six months of proper facilities for analyzing the quinine and
                                alkaloid content of cinchona bark and for making full and final
                                payment for all bark thus analyzed. He pointed out that it was more
                                than six months since the Agreement was signed and that thus far
                                this provision had not been met.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>He then referred to paragraph A which provides for the
                                establishment of an efficient processing plant and said that so far
                                as he knew nothing whatever had been done in this connection.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I was not sufficiently familiar with the details of the Quinine program
                            to enter into the discussion of specific points and informed the
                            President to this effect and stated that if there has been a failure to
                            conform to the terms of the Agreement, I would do everything possible to
                            see that such deficiencies were corrected. Mr. Kinnear attempted to
                            clarify one or two points which the President brought up but he was in
                            such a state of annoyance that it was utterly impossible for Mr. Kinnear
                            to make any explanation whatever.</p>
                        <p>Following the meeting with the President, I held several conferences with
                            Messrs. Kinnear, Rainey and Tewksbury regarding the provisions of the
                            Agreement and progress which has been made to comply with these. After
                            some discussion it was felt that bark which was rejected by the Defense
                            Supplies Corporation because it contained less than two per cent
                            crystallizable alkaloids should be held by the Ecuadoran Development
                            Corporation for disposal as indicated by the seller, either to consumers
                            in Ecuador or in export markets. It was clear that the second point
                            raised by the President was an entirely justifiable complaint. Mr.
                            Rainey pointed out, however, that within the past week or ten days
                            sufficient technical help has arrived and that his office has adequate
                            facilities for making final analyses of cinchona bark. He stated that it
                            would be possible, if necessary, to commence immediately to make the
                            final analyses and to pay the full hundred per cent price for bark on
                            the basis of these analyses. It was realized that authority should
                            probably be secured from Washington before taking this step but in view
                            of the President’s attitude and the necessity for some immediate action,
                            I felt that this concession <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0311"
                            />should immediately be made since we clearly have not complied with the
                            provisions of the Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rainey explained that prior to the establishment of any processing
                            plant, some information was essential as to the extent of cinchona
                            stands, the type of bark available, et cetera. He indicated that the
                            primary investigations have now been completed and that he and Mr.
                            Kinnear have already requested that technical assistants be sent to
                            Ecuador as promptly as possible to assist in determining the type of
                            plant which should be erected in Ecuador.</p>
                        <p>On September 15 I again called on the President with Messrs. Kinnear,
                            Rainey and Tewksbury. I explained that as far as the rejected bark of
                            Senator Miguel Heredia Crespo was concerned, we felt that the
                            Corporation should act as agent for the seller and that if it were to be
                            exported, the Development Corporation was the sole entity having
                            authority to undertake this. In this connection paragraph 3(<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) was quoted. The President very emphatically
                            took exception to this statement. He insisted that the statement “in no
                            case shall exports be permitted after June 30, 1943 of cinchona bark or
                            its products” referred exclusively to the contracts existing previous to
                            the signature of the Agreement. In other words, the quoted clause
                            referred exclusively to paragraph 3 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>).</p>
                        <p>After some discussion of this point I explained that it was essential
                            that there be some control exercised which would prevent the exportation
                            of bark containing over two per cent crystallizable alkaloids by those
                            holding bark which had been rejected by Defense Supplies. The President
                            agreed freely that there must be a rigid control. In the case of the
                            consignments of Heredia Crespo held by the Corporation, the President
                            said that since this bark was in the warehouse of the Corporation it
                            could be shipped to its warehouses in Guayaquil and delivered directly
                            to customs for exportation. He further stated that he was in entire
                            agreement that all bark desired by the Defense Supplies Corporation
                            should be delivered to it. He further stated that such measures of
                            control as Defense Supplies and the Ecuadoran Development Corporation
                            desired would be put into effect to insure that no bark was exported in
                            excess of two per cent except by Development Corporation.</p>
                        <p>It may be that some authorities in Washington will raise a question as to
                            the President’s interpretation of the contract as refers to the
                            exportation of bark by private entities. There are a number of
                            conflicting clauses in the Agreement. One says that bark rejected by
                            Defense Supplies may be disposed of freely. Another (paragraph 2, (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>)) states that the Agency “will be the sole and
                            exclusive purchaser” and a third says that in no case shall exports of
                            cinchona bark be permitted after June 30 except by the Agency. Due to
                            the ambiguities, <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0312"/>the
                            President’s interpretation must undoubtedly be accepted but I believe
                            that his willingness to provide adequate controls is a sufficient
                            safeguard.</p>
                        <p>At that point Senator Heredia Crespo who had been waiting in the anteroom
                            was called in and the President carefully explained that as provided in
                            the terms of the Agreement, he would be authorized to sell his bark
                            freely if the Defense Supplies Corporation rejected it. The President
                            explained, however, that since some companies might be tempted to export
                            bark of over two per cent, mixing this with rejected bark, it would be
                            necessary to institute rigid export controls. He also made it very clear
                            to Mr. Heredia Crespo that regardless of analyses which he might obtain,
                            the analyses made by Defense Supplies must rule with reference to
                            acceptance or rejection of any specific lots of bark.</p>
                        <p>Although Senator Heredia Crespo apparently was not completely satisfied
                            with the decision, the President gave the impression that he considers
                            the difficulties with Heredia Crespo settled and that he would support
                            the Corporation and Defense Supplies in this matter. He stated, however,
                            that his one interest was to avoid difficulties and to see that Defense
                            Supplies received the bark it desired. He pointed out that if there was
                            bark which was unacceptable to Defense Supplies he wanted to see this
                            moved in order not to prejudice Ecuadoran interests by having the bark
                            frozen. Senator Heredia Crespo has apparently invested some six hundred
                            thousand sucres in bark, much of which is definitely of an inferior
                            quality and unquestionably includes some lots previously rejected by
                            Defense Supplies. He is apparently much worried for fear that he will
                            not be able to dispose of it without substantial loss.</p>
                        <p>The President appeared to be satisfied when he was informed that there
                            are now adequate facilities for analyses of bark and full payment on the
                            basis of these.</p>
                        <p>The President was likewise satisfied with my explanation of what had been
                            done thus far looking toward the establishment of a processing plant. I
                            explained that both Mr. Rainey and Mr. Kinnear have specifically
                            requested that a technical expert be sent to study this problem and I
                            suggested that possibly the Ecuadoran Government would like to name an
                            expert who might consult with the one to be sent from the United States.
                            The President appeared to be pleased with this suggestion.</p>
                        <p>While it now appears that the immediate dissatisfaction of the President
                            has been dissipated, the threat of a recurrence of this will remain
                            unless every effort is made to comply strictly with the provisions of
                            the Agreement as far as obligations of the United States are concerned.
                            The President has a very legalistic mind and is extremely <pb n="299"
                                xml:id="pg_299" facs="0313"/>keen. Possibly as the result of
                            previous difficulties in connection with the Rubber Agreement, he seems
                            to be suspicious of the good faith of our Government in fulfilling its
                            obligations. Whether the failure to do so has been due to negligence or
                            other reason, it is definitely true that with respect to both the Rubber
                            and Quinine Agreements, there have been clear cut failures to meet our
                            obligations. Under the circumstances I feel that Mr. Rainey did the only
                            thing which could be done in agreeing to make full payment for bark on
                            the basis of his analyses and in admitting that private sellers could
                            export with the proviso that adequate controls would be established.
                            Respectfully yours,</p>

                                reported that President Arroyo charged that the Corporation had
                                produced no tangible results (822.50/289).</note> The President
                            notified the directors and the Ambassador that he desired Ecuadoran
                            participation in the management and mentioned an Ecuadoran co-manager.
                            At the following sessions of the board we pointed out <pb n="301"
                                xml:id="pg_301" facs="0315"/>that the President’s suggestion
                            involved a fundamental change in the principle of the Corporation which
                            would require negotiations between the respective Governments. We
                            offered as our personal view the impracticability of divided functions
                            between the Ecuadoran and American co-managers. The Ecuadoran directors
                            were fully in accord. We indicated that our Government’s reaction would
                            probably be in favor of a wholly Ecuadoran entity both directorate and
                            management. This was unsatisfactory to the Ecuadoran directors who
                            requested us not to inform Washington until they had an opportunity to
                            discuss the matter with the President alone. The Ecuadoran members met
                            with the President on the 30th and reported that the President was still
                            of his original view regarding co-management as reported in Embassy’s
                            despatch 568, October 12 and insisted upon American participation on the
                            board. The Ecuadoran directors stated that the President really wanted
                            full managerial control.…</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador and ourselves met with the President yesterday. We
                            explained to the President that we were unable to meet his view, as
                            regards co-management and that we were prepared to recommend to
                            Washington that if any change were made in the Corporation the latter
                            should be set up as an entirely Ecuadoran entity with appropriate US
                            control over disbursement of funds. The President immediately asked
                            whether this involved cancellation of the credit. We replied that we had
                            not considered this possibility. The President said that although he
                            still preferred the retention of the American directors nevertheless he
                            would be agreeable to a purely Ecuadoran entity if the credit were
                            continued. We informed him that we would of course transmit his
                            suggestion as to co-managers but would also convey our own views and
                            would await instructions. He agreed.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador and ourselves upon consideration of the whole situation
                            here feel that a reorganization is not only desirable but necessary and
                            that a purely Ecuadoran entity would relieve the United States of
                            further operational responsibility. [Moore and Mersereau.]</p>

                            returning United States management of unexpended balance of $500,000,
                            Fomento will (1) return to United States as much of road and trail
                            building equipment as has been delivered to them; (2) pay-United States
                            for radio equipment now on order when it arrives; (3) return unexpended
                            balance of $10,000 delivered to Fomento from $500,000 fund for operation
                            Fomento Rubber Department; (4) pay-United States in cash for merchandise
                            as it arrives. We understand cancellation of agreement of October 17 is
                            acceptable to President and we expect to work closely with him on
                            expenditure of balance of fund. Fomento has virtually ceased expenditure
                            of development fund and has no program for unexpended balance. Fomento
                            has no department adequate for operation of organizations on projects
                            and terms specified by United States.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore future policies of Fomento appear very uncertain in view of
                            persistent demands in the press for reorganization. In view of entire
                            situation and the fact that Fomento has delivered to date only 20 tons
                            of rubber consider it most desirable to accept Fomento’s suggestion in
                            order that program can proceed as rapidly as possible and free of
                            extrinsic problems. We believe we can make satisfactory-arrangements to
                            continue in one way or another features of Fomento rubber program which
                            we consider desirable. This applies chiefly to Oriente operation. In
                            order to avoid delays in program and to conclude this matter while
                            directors are here please rush cable authorizing us to execute agreement
                            with Fomento as outlined above. The Ambassador agrees with me that
                            procurement program for rubber could best be served by accepting this
                            decision of Fomento and carrying out the proposed liquidation,

                        <p>796. For Mersereau from Pierson. Refer your telegram No. 908 October 15.
                            Pending a full understanding present situation it is impossible to reach
                            any decision. Believe it would be impractical to attempt solution prior
                            to your return to Washington which should be as soon as conveniently
                            possible.… You may inform Ecuadorans that suggestion that authority be
                            divided between two co-managers has not <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303"
                                facs="0317"/>been favorably received in Washington and that both
                            Eximbank and State Department firmly convinced that such plan is
                            infeasible. Without formal presentation to Ecuadorans be prepared upon
                            return to give us your views upon which of the following two plans might
                            be acceptable to Ecuadorans. 1. Eximbank would consider making
                            corporation wholly Ecuadoran entity although in such case Eximbank would
                            desire employment of (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Kinnear or other
                            qualified technician as Agricultural Consultant, (<hi rend="italic"
                                >b</hi>) qualified engineer to act as Consulting Engineer and (<hi
                                rend="italic">c</hi>) qualified Comptroller. As in other instances
                            Eximbank would retain right of final approval on all projects submitted.
                            Eximbank would have no objection to having one or more Americans on
                            Board of Directors in such case. 2. Complete dissolution of corporation
                            and transfer of balance of credit to government to finance projects to
                            be passed on by jointly chosen Consulting Engineer and approved by
                            Eximbank. Either of foregoing alternatives would involve closer scrutiny
                            of projects and probable curtailment of types of projects acceptable to
                            Eximbank. [Pierson.]</p>

                        <p>886. Please get in touch with Kinnear and inform him that the Department
                            and the Bank and Ross Moore do not feel that any substantial change
                            should be made in the structure of the Development Corporation at this
                            time. We believe that the President of Ecuador is now in agreement with
                            this point of view and wishes Kinnear to remain as General Manager and
                            to have an Ecuadoran appointed Assistant Manager. The Department and the
                            Bank are willing to appoint Chiriboga as Assistant Manager if this meets
                            with the President’s approval. We feel that the above represents the
                            best solution to the present difficulties and wish you to urge Kinnear
                            to stay on as General Manager. If you can persuade Kinnear to remain as
                            General Manager on this basis please take the matter up with the
                            President and endeavor to get his approval to Chiriboga’s

                            permitted after that date with the Central Bank or any other institution

                            financial assistance to eliminate undesirable ownership and control from
                            Proclaimed List firms.</p>
                        <p>As is indicated in the circular instruction of June 18, 1943, it is
                            considered desirable that local interests acquire the ownership of
                            Proclaimed List properties which are sold. However, should circumstances
                            warrant such a step, the Department will not object to the participation
                            by United States private capital either on a minority ownership basis
                            and/or a management fee basis. More extensive participation by United
                            States capital may be approved in cases where it appears to be
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>It would be desirable to report the nature and extent of the outside
                            financing which will probably be required. In regard to Saice,<pb
                                n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0321"/>you are informed that A. E.
                            Whitehouse and Co., Inc., of 90 Broad Street, New York City, has
                            expressed interest. Whitehouse and Company has been informed that the
                            policy of the Department is to favor local acquisition of Proclaimed
                            List properties, but that if local capital is not interested, the
                            Department has no objection to participation by the United States
                            concern on the basis outlined above.</p>

                        <p>I seem to be in a pugnacious mood these days. With due apologies, I
                            wonder whether the time hasn’t also come to modify our lend-lease policy
                            towards the other Republics.</p>
                        <p>Our policy would originally appear to have been motivated by the
                            following basic considerations: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>By giving the other Republics an assurance of security and
                                    support, we wanted to line them up on our team.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>We wanted them to have the means to suppress local fifth
                                    column movements.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>We wanted them to be in a position to beat off enemy forays,
                                    and to delay more serious thrusts.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Since the establishment of our policy, the validity of all three of these
                            considerations has been 99 percent eliminated by the course of events.
                            As suggested above, the arms are likely to be used for a very different
                            purpose than they were intended—not one consonant with our basic
                            political policies or agreeable to the American taxpayer. And as you
                            pointed out some time ago, the mere fact of the distribution of these
                            arms is tending to stir up international suspicions.</p>
                        <p>An important corollary to our lend-lease policy in this hemisphere has
                            been our uniform refusal to give anything but direct military aid
                            through lend-lease. But, given the above circumstances, could we not now
                            reverse ourselves and fulfil the commitments already embodied in
                            lend-lease agreements by delivering articles the use of which would be
                            to our mutual long-term advantage, for example, road-building machinery?
                            The consent of the other Republics would of course have to be secured,
                            but I should think they might be willing to substitute a shiny new
                            bull-dozer for a shiny new howitzer, and it <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310"
                                facs="0324"/>seems to me that this would be a neat way to get
                            ourselves gracefully out of our commitments. This would of course have
                            to be done either within the existing law or through an amendment to it,
                            and might enable us to cut down our total commitments very considerably
                            while assuaging any hurt feelings in the other Republics at not getting
                            their lethal toys.</p>
                        <p>Attached is a memorandum from the Salvadoran Embassy requesting
                            permission to purchase some road equipment to be used on the maintenance
                            of the Inter-American Highway, as mentioned in my previous

                        <p>189. Department’s 150, July 20, 4 p.m. The Subsecretary of National
                            Defense states that an order for 1000 sub-machine guns has been placed
                            with the Harrington and Richardson Arms Company Worcester,
                            Massachusetts, upon the recommendation of the Salvadoran Military
                            Attaché. He added that this equipment is required by the national guard
                            (about 800 men) and army officers, to replace obsolescent guns. He made
                            no mention of a request for such material addressed to the Coast
                            Guard.</p>

                            Martínez continuation in the Presidency for a fourth term. It is
                            possible that opposition to this plan may develop and that this
                            particular type of weapon may be desired for the repression of civil

                        <p>The Department has given careful consideration to the factors underlying
                            this request and has come to the conclusion that it would be undesirable
                            to furnish any of these sub-machine guns to the Government of El

                            (in connection with which he said Guatemala is now receiving Mexican

                        <p>In Washington the secondary objective of the Mission will be to obtain
                            for El Salvador a larger quota of American gasoline and petroleum
                            products required in part to meet the demands of the mining industry

                        <p>The major purpose of the visit to Washington, however, is to take up with
                            the American authorities the question of the Salvadoran external debt.
                            Sr. Bustamante stated that he hopes to receive the Department’s support
                            of a proposal for revision of the Salvadoran debt. Although he did not
                            explicitly so state, I received the impression that the proposal <pb

                        <p>A–250. There is being sent you by airmail a copy of a statement<note
                                n="16" xml:id="d285fn16">Not printed; it was transmitted with
                                Department’s instruction No. 191, June 2, 1943.</note> showing sales
                            of petroleum production for consumption in El Salvador as compared with
                            estimated requirements in accordance with the pool formula.<note n="17"
                                xml:id="d285fn17">A quota of 40 percent of 1941 consumption, plus
                                war essentials, and such additional amounts as could be proved to be
                                absolutely necessary to prevent serious economic dislocation and
                                which could be supplied by available transportation
                                facilities.</note> From this statement for El Salvador for the 3
                            months ending March 1943, it is abundantly clear that rationing in El
                            Salvador is not only failing to effectively keep petroleum consumption
                            within the quota but that, in addition, total over-all tonnage made
                            available for this country has been exceeded.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that this situation cannot continue without developing
                            petroleum shortages. You should therefore immediately take this up with
                            the appropriate El Salvadoran authorities, and strongly urge that the
                            necessary steps be taken to bring consumption within the supplies
                            available to El Salvador.</p>
                        <p>The El Salvadoran authorities should be warned of the gravity of the
                            situation and informed that if they run out of supplies by exceeding the
                            quantities allocated to them, there can be no dependence upon the pool
                            making up deficiencies. You should stress that the tanker situation
                            continues to be restricted and that sight must not be lost of the fact
                            that all deliveries are subject to the exigencies of war.</p>

                        <p>I accompanied the Salvadoran Economic Mission to a meeting in the
                            Petroleum Adviser’s office to discuss the Salvadoran Government’s
                            request for additional (over quota) allotments of petroleum products.
                            Señor Mejía, speaking for the rationing authority in El Salvador, began
                            by saying that the rationing authority had made every effort to maintain
                            consumption within quota limits, that they had received numerous
                            commendations for the manner in which they had done this, and that they
                            were consequently somewhat surprised just before leaving to hear that we
                            had complained that they were running over their quota. A very friendly
                            conversation followed in which it appeared that while Salvador had
                            overconsumed in some products, over-consumption had been balanced by
                            underconsumption of gasoline.</p>
                        <p>The Salvadorans said that when their mission asked for an additional
                            allotment (which had been granted) to move the coffee crop they had
                            overlooked certain other essentials at other seasons, for example,
                            gasoline for the cotton industry, and asked if we could give equally
                            favorable treatment to such cases. Mr. Sappington then advised the
                            Mission of preliminary allotments for war essential and economic
                            essential uses which had been approved by the Essentials Requirements
                            Committee on the basis of information sent by our Embassy in San
                            Salvador. From the conversation which followed, it was not possible to
                            make a careful study of the extent to which these allotments would meet
                            the full Salvadoran needs. The Salvadoran Mission consequently said that
                            they would study the matter carefully and probably get in touch with us
                            again in a day or two.</p>
                        <p>Señor Bustamante raised the question of fuel for the maintenance of the
                            gold mines. It was pointed out that the gold mines in the United States
                            had been closed down, and that we had severely restricted supplies to
                            the Mcaraguan gold mines in spite of their importance to <pb n="315"
                                xml:id="pg_315" facs="0329"/>the economy of the country. Señor
                            Bustamante explained that the gold mines in El Salvador actually
                            produced about 40 times as much silver as gold by volume, but that they
                            would flood if they were not kept pumped, and that one section of El
                            Salvador largely depended on them for its livelihood. Mr. Cabot said
                            that he was not very hopeful that anything could be done to secure
                            critical materials for Salvadoran gold mines.</p>
                        <p>Although there were points of disagreement during the conversation, it
                            was entirely affable and each side at the end seemed fully to understand
                            the other.</p>
                        <p rend="right">June 28 and 29.</p>
                        <p>At subsequent meetings, the Mission again requested an additional
                            allotment for the cotton industry. In this connection, the Mission
                            pointed out that the seasonal allotment for last season for the coffee
                            industry had not been entirely utilized since the Salvadorans had looked
                            upon the allotment as for use only until the end of the calendar year.
                            Thus, with a late crop, Salvador had used regular quota oil for coffee
                            needs in the new year. Also the Mission stated that the gold mining
                            industry would be put on a quota (40%) basis for oil needs.<note n="21"

                            of the arguments advanced, an additional 1000 barrels of oil was
                            approved for the remainder of 1943 for the cotton industry, which amount
                            it was estimated, when added to oil saved from the reduction of the gold
                            mine requirements, would put the industry on a current basis regarding

                        <p>I had occasion to call on the Minister of Foreign Affairs on June 10 in
                            connection with another matter. He brought up the subject of the
                            Embassy’s note regarding Salvadoran excess consumption of petroleum
                            products and stated that he had been requested by the Minister of
                                Finance<note n="26" xml:id="d287fn26">Rodrigo Samayoa.</note> to say
                            to me orally and informally that out of deference to the Embassy the
                            official reply to the Embassy’s note above cited would be perfunctory,
                            but that in fact the Government associated itself fully with the terms
                            of the communication addressed to the Embassy on June 8 by the Sub
                            Comité de Combustibles. I replied that I understood that perhaps the
                            Embassy’s note was a bit firm in tone, but that after giving thought to
                            the matter I had decided that I would address it to the foreign office
                            nonetheless. I added that it seemed to me likely that when the matter
                            had been gone into thoroughly it would be found that certain corrective
                            measures would have to be taken here in order to ensure the continued
                            supply of petroleum products required by El Salvador and I pointed out
                            that according to reports that had been brought to the Embassy, one of
                            the major defects in the present system is the lack of adequate control
                            over governmental withdrawals.</p>
                        <p>In despatch No. 463 of June 15, 1943,<note n="27" xml:id="d287fn27">Not
                                printed.</note> the results of a thorough analysis of the statement
                            of the Petroleum Supply Committee on petroleum consumption in El
                            Salvador were reported. In brief, this report shows that national sales
                            for the first three months of the current year in the Republic had
                            exceeded the quota by only 3.7% and that appreciable excesses, if any,
                            had occurred only in the special allotments for essential industries and
                            activities. A large part of the overconsumption computed in this
                            category was due to an error in the allocation of gasoline and diesel
                            oil for moving the local coffee crop on a basis of average monthly
                            consumption rather than on specific monthly consumption for the crop
                            season. This error alone accounted for a large part of the alleged
                            overdrawals, and the balance was due <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317"
                                facs="0331"/>to extra gasoline, diesel oil and fuel oil for the
                            construction of the Pan-American Highway and for the use of the
                            International Railways of Central America, both uses of special interest
                            to the United States Government. In view of these considerations, it
                            seems doubtful whether or not El Salvador’s excess consumption of
                            petroleum products for the first three months of 1943 was really of a
                            serious nature.</p>
                        <p>Since this period, however, that is during April and May, overdrafts on
                            petroleum products for “national sales” have steadily mounted and have
                            reached a cumulative total of 2,294 barrels. It is believed that this
                            excess consumption can be offset only by rather drastic measures. The
                            note of the Sub Comité de Combustibles, although courteously worded,
                            gives no assurance that such measures will be taken, indeed it seems to
                            indicate that this body is entirely unwilling to curtail consumption
                            further.</p>
                        <p>Since the inception of its rationing system the Government of El Salvador
                            has maintained that consumption of kerosene, the principal means of
                            lighting for the masses of the rural population, could not be cut much
                            below normal levels and that ample supplies of diesel oil were basically
                            essential to the economy of the country for urban and interurban
                            passenger and produce transportation. To provide these supplies, then, a
                            policy of drastic curtailment of motor gasoline consumption<note n="28"
                                xml:id="d287fn28">The Ambassador in El Salvador, in a section of
                                this despatch here omitted, praised the curtailment program, stating
                                that nearly 50 percent of all private cars had been denied gasoline
                                altogether and that the remaining private automobiles were being
                                allotted the barest minimum. He added, however, that gasoline for
                                government official and unofficial cars had been curtailed scarcely
                                at all.</note> in order to allow for almost normal consumption of
                            kerosene and diesel oil was adopted, and this policy was reasonably
                            successful until about the end of March 1943. Since then
                            underconsumption of gasoline has not offset overconsumption of the other
                            two products.</p>

                        <p>The Supply Committee for Latin America is being instructed to make
                            available to El Salvador the additional new allotments as set forth in
                            the above memorandum, and the Salvadoran Economic Mission has been
                            advised that the contents of the memorandum would be sent to you.</p>
                        <p>The question of establishment, in accordance with supply pool principles,
                            of a supply pool committee has been discussed with Sr. Bustamante. Since
                            the Inter-American Petroleum Supply Pool is a collaborative endeavor
                            among the participating countries, it is considered advisable that each
                            such country establish a pool committee consisting of representatives of
                            the government and of the petroleum companies supplying the country.
                            These committees are national committees of the participating countries
                            and are in no sense subcommittees of the Petroleum Supply Committee for
                            Latin America. The latter committee makes supplies available in
                            accordance with instructions based on supply pool principles, and does
                            not formulate policy in regard to the operation of the pool. The
                            national pool committee should collaborate with the Petroleum Supply
                            Committee for Latin America in regard to petroleum supplies and with the
                            rationing and other interested agencies of the local government.</p>
                        <p>The advisability of formalizing the Salvadoran pool committee along the
                            foregoing lines was suggested to Sr. Bustamante, who indicated his
                            agreement. It was requested that you also discuss this matter with the
                            appropriate Salvadoran authorities.</p>
                        <p>With reference to our A–250, May 31 and your A–185, June 4,<note n="33"
                                xml:id="d288fn33">Latter not printed.</note> we have considered with
                            the Mission the question of Salvadoran rationing of allotments available
                            to Salvador. This examination with the Mission of consumption as
                            compared with allotments during the first 4 months of 1943 indicates
                            that the rationing of gasoline by Salvadoran rationing authorities has
                            been very good, the amount saved more than offsetting the
                            over-consumption of gas oil and kerosene. In this connection, as you
                            know, within its total allotment a country may substitute more of one
                            product for less of another. The over-consumption of fuel oil apparently
                            has been in the war essential category, which of course is not subject
                            to rationing, and indicates <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0334"
                            />either that needs have been underestimated or that consumption has
                            been at a rate greater than actual needs. From information contained in
                            your A–155<note n="34" xml:id="d288fn34">Dated May 25, 1943, not
                                printed.</note> it appears that excessive quantities may have been
                            allotted to essential requirements.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of the foregoing, the Mission was complimented on the fact
                            that in general Salvador appears to have done good work in rationing
                            during the first four months of this year. You should, however, continue
                            on appropriate occasions to urge that this good work be continued and
                            that rationing be kept strictly within available allotments. The
                            Salvadoran authorities must continue to keep clearly in mind that the
                            tanker situation continues serious and that all deliveries are subject
                            to the exigencies of war.</p>

                        <p>A–297. Department’s A–286, July 1, 1943. After receiving the Department’s
                            memorandum of June 25, which was quoted in the airgram under reference,
                            the Salvadoran Economic Mission requested an additional 100,000 gallons
                            of diesel oil for the cotton industry for the 6 months’ period May 1 to
                            September 30. The Mission stated that the total requirements for the
                            cotton industry amounted to approximately 132,000 gallons but that the
                            remaining 32,000 gallons would be supplied from the 40 percent quota.
                            The Mission further stated that the requirements for the mines would be
                            reduced to 40 percent of consumption, that is, from about 25,536 gallons
                            to 10,214 gallons per month, thus saving 15,322 gallons per month.</p>
                        <p>It was realized that, while over a period of time this savings would take
                            care of the estimated needs of the cotton crop, this would not be
                            accomplished during the remainder of this year. After discussions with
                            the Mission on the basis of the information presented, with account
                            taken of your recent pertinent despatches, the decision Was reached to
                            supply a further 1,000 barrels of oil to Salvador during the remainder
                            of the year in order that the needs of the cotton industry can be
                            covered on an approximately current basis. Accordingly, the following
                            supplemental memorandum, which revises as indicated the Department’s
                            memorandum of June 25, was handed to the Mission on June 30: <quote

                        <p>The Mission referred to the fact that they had applied to the Board of
                            Economic Warfare for serial numbers for the mines which would enable
                            them to obtain critical materials, and inquired whether oil would be
                            made available for any mine which received such a number. Sr. Mejía
                            indicated that he had hope only in one case, that of the silver mine, of
                            being granted such a number. The Mission was informed that if a serial
                            number was granted in the case of any mine, the necessary requirements
                            for oil would be met.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy, by its endeavor with the Salvadoran authorities and by its
                            reports to the Department, has been most helpful in regard to the
                            various recent questions concerning the supply of oil to Salvador.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Nuland first outlined the petroleum situation and the necessity for a
                            re-examination and re-scheduling of the essential petroleum
                            requirements. The meeting was then opened to discussion and each
                            essential category was taken up. The following recalculation by
                            categories of operations and uses was arrived at:</p>

                            explanatory comments cover only those points wherein the above schedule

                        <p>Mr. Nuland thought that an ample investigation had been made and that
                            this new schedule, subject to the determination at a later date of the
                            estimate of requirements for the coffee industry for the coming season,
                            represented as just and equitable a scheduling of El Salvador’s
                            requirements for petroleum products in the essential categories as could
                            be arrived at in the light of past performance and anticipation of
                            future needs. This Embassy concurs and it is recommended that the new
                            schedule be set up in as close conformity with this proposal as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Nuland’s efficient and effective work during his short stay in El
                            Salvador is particularly to be commended and this Embassy has greatly
                            appreciated his assistance and cooperation.</p>

                            284,965 gallons of motor gasoline and 294,744 gallons of diesel oil
                            represents a reasonably just and equitable scheduling of El Salvador’s

                            essential industry for the period mentioned. It is recommended that
                            amounts in as close conformity as possible with these estimates be set
                            up in the new general petroleum products schedule for El Salvador.<note

                            copies of a fund-freezing law and a law governing the sale of properties
                            belonging to firms or individuals on the proclaimed list, which it was
                            understood would soon be approved by the National Assembly and made
                            effective by the Executive Power.</p>
                        <p>It recently became apparent, however, that although the proposed laws had
                            been approved by the Assembly, the Salvadoran executive authorities were
                            reluctant, if not entirely unwilling, to put them into operation. The
                            Minister of Finance, Dr. Samayoa, with whom Mr. Maleady and Mr.
                                Ryan<note n="43" xml:id="d292fn43">Joseph E. Maleady, Vice Consul,
                                and Daniel V. Ryan, special assistant, at the Embassy in El
                                Salvador.</note> had several exhaustive conversations on the
                            subject, held tenaciously to the contention that there are grave
                            Constitutional objections to the contemplated measures, and cited in
                            support of his argument the following articles of the Salvadoran
                            Constitution: Article 34 (forbidding confiscation and making the
                            officials who violate the prohibition responsible both as to their
                            persons and properties); 37 (guaranteeing persons as to their life,
                            liberty, and property); 39 (trial by previously existing courts under
                            previously existing laws); 42 (laws not to have retroactive effect); 50
                            (inviolability of property); and 177 (responsibility of officials for
                                <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0339"/>crimes—<hi rend="italic"
                                >delitos</hi>—committed while in office). Attempts to show that the
                            Constitutional provisions enumerated need not be construed to prevent
                            the enactment of the desired laws were unavailing, as were other points
                            adduced, such as the fact that our own Constitution contains strong
                            prohibitions against the confiscation of property—despite which, wartime
                            measures affecting enemy alien property in the United States have not
                            been nullified by the American courts—and the Embassy’s opinion that
                            even without the enactment of new legislation the desired objectives
                            could be attained under the laws of March 7 and June 4, 1942.</p>
                        <p>When it had become clear that this was the situation, it was decided that
                            I should take up the subject directly with President Martínez and
                            accordingly, on June 25, accompanied by Mr. Maleady and Mr. Ryan, I
                            called on the President for that purpose. The Minister of Finance and
                            the Minister and Sub-Secretary of Foreign Affairs<note n="44"
                                xml:id="d292fn44">Arturo Ramón Avila (Minister) and Joaquin Leiva
                                (Sub-Secretary).</note> were also present at the interview.</p>
                        <p>I began the conversation by stating to the President that the fine
                            cooperation that has been given by the Government of El Salvador during
                            the past year in connection with the blocking and sale of alien funds
                            and properties had been greatly appreciated, and that it had been hoped
                            that this cooperation would carry through to the final accomplishment of
                            our objective of eliminating Axis interests through the enactment of
                            certain legislation recently passed by the National Legislative
                            Assembly. The President immediately replied that his Government was
                            confronted in this matter by a problem of Constitutionality—since not
                            only the proposed measures but also those of last March and June were
                            unconstitutional and could expose members of the Government, including
                            himself, to punitive proceedings, and that the only solution of the
                            problem lay in calling a plebiscite for the purpose of making the
                            necessary amendments to the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>It is becoming increasingly obvious (and I was informed of the fact
                            almost by direct assertion a few days ago by Señor Francisco Aguilar, a
                            close associate of the President) that it is the intention to bring
                            about General Martínez’ continuation in office for a fourth term.
                            Inasmuch as the Constitution of 1939 (itself the product of a
                            Constituent Assembly designed to make possible Martínez’ present third
                            term) forbids succession in office, the only means by which this plan
                            can be carried out is by another Constituent Assembly and change of
                            Constitution. It is to be assumed that the President and his advisers
                            would be glad to seize upon our desire to effect the liquidation of
                            enemy alien interests in El Salvador as the pretext for convoking a
                            Constitutent Assembly. In view of these considerations I promptly and
                            explicitly stated that the convocation of a Constituent <pb n="326"
                                xml:id="pg_326" facs="0340"/>Assembly and the amendment of the
                            Constitution were matters of such an intimately local nature, affecting
                            the sovereign acts of El Salvador, that the Embassy could not be a party
                            to, or be put in the position of being a party to, or responsible for,
                            any action of the kind.</p>
                        <p>At this point, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Maleady took up the discussion on its
                            factual basis, pointing out that the Salvadoran Government had proceeded
                            with sales of Axis properties for more than one year under their laws of
                            last March and June, and that it seemed inexplicable that the Government
                            should now suddenly discover the constitutional hindrances cited, the
                            more so as no challenge has been made in the courts. They stated that
                            the American Constitution also prohibits confiscation but that we had
                            sold Axis properties already vested and that no constitutional doubt on
                            such war measures had ever been raised in the United States. The
                            President and the Ministers present asserted that their constitutional
                            apprehensions are not based on doubts but on conviction, and that the
                            only solution was to call a Constituent Assembly in order to amend the
                            Constitution.</p>
                        <p>President Martínez was pointedly asked whether it was the continuing
                            policy of his Government to sell all Axis properties both real and
                            personal. He replied that he would go ahead with such sales, but would
                            confine them to stores and similar properties, and would not under
                            present conditions endeavor to carry out the sale of agricultural
                            properties. No explanation was forthcoming of the distinction drawn
                            between the sale of stores, for example, and real property—but the
                            President and Dr. Samayoa both remarked that agricultural properties can
                            not be sold because the persons in charge of the Real Estate Registry
                            Office (Registro de Propiedad Raiz) would not register such sales
                            because they would not be constitutional. Dr. Samayoa also remarked that
                            no one would purchase such properties because of the fear that the sale
                            might be classified as illegal by a future government.</p>
                        <p>It was apparent that the President and his associates were attempting to
                            impress us largely by the vehemence of their assertions and that they
                            were uninformed with regard not only to the Constitution of the United
                            States, but that of El Salvador: for example, they apparently believed
                            that the Constitution of the United States could be modified by the
                            Congress alone; also that an Act of Congress in itself was
                            “constitutional” and not subject to interpretation by the Supreme Court.
                            Furthermore, they attempted to maintain that the Salvadoran Constitution
                            does not grant any powers to the Supreme Court with respect to
                            legislative action. I remarked with respect to this observation that I
                            had noticed in Salvadoran legislation that the preamble generally
                            contained a clause stating that the opinion of the Supreme Court had
                            been heard with respect to the proposed legislation and that <pb n="327"
                                xml:id="pg_327" facs="0341"/>it was to be presumed that legislation
                            thus reviewed in advance by the Supreme Court would be in conformity
                            with the Constitution, and it was admitted that this is true—but that it
                            would not absolve the Government from the Constitutional penalties
                            previously mentioned.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the interview I stated to the President that I
                            believed the situation was that the Salvadoran Government had undertaken
                            and would continue the blocking and sale of enemy alien firms, but that
                            it had come to be of the opinion that its action in this respect was
                            unconstitutional and that a means would be sought to overcome this
                            difficulty. I stated again that insofar as a plebiscite or modification
                            of the Salvadoran Constitution was concerned, the matter was definitely
                            one of the exclusive sovereign concern of El Salvador in connection with
                            which the American Embassy could assume no responsibility of any kind.
                            The President stated that that was the situation.</p>

                            No. 498, June 26, 1943 in which you describe a conversation which you
                            had with the President of El Salvador and other Salvadoran officials
                            with regard to the possibility of the liquidation, pursuant to proposed
                            Salvadoran legislative action, of Axis interests on the Proclaimed

                        <p>The Department is gratified to note that you were careful to state to the
                            President that the amendment of the Salvadoran Constitution is a matter

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Committee desires to call your
                            attention to the fact that the Republic of El Salvador has published, in
                            the <hi rend="italic">Diario Oficial</hi> of November 30th last, a
                            Decree providing for the repatriation of approximately $1,523,000
                            principal amount of various issues of its foreign bonds at a price of
                            approximately 20% of par value. The Committee has reason to believe that
                            the parties who sold these bonds to the Government acquired them at an
                            average price of not much over 10%.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the Republic has failed to provide funds to meet
                            the service on its foreign debt since January 1st, 1938, on the grounds
                            that the general economic situation of the country has prevented the
                            Government from complying with these obligations, the Committee is
                            seriously concerned at the implications of this proposal.</p>
                        <p>It is the opinion of this Committee that any funds the Republic may have
                            available for debt payments should be first applied to the liquidation
                            of the interest due, and that the diversion of funds for extinguishing
                            obligations of this character when they have been in default for many
                            years, and as a consequence selling at very low levels, constitutes a
                            reprehensible practice and evidences a lack of good faith on the part of
                            the Republic towards its creditors.</p>
                        <p>Some 3000 bondholders represented by this Committee have shown
                            considerable patience over a 4–year period in the belief that the
                            Salvador Government would eventually carry out the repeated assurances
                            it has given them to the effect that service on the foreign debt would
                            be resumed the moment its financial situation permitted the Government
                            to do so. From the facts presented herein it would appear that the
                            confidence of the bondholders in the assurances of the Salvador
                            Government has not been warranted.</p>
                        <p>The Committee considers the facts presented herein constitute a violation
                            of the Loan Agreement of 1922,<note n="49" xml:id="d295fn49">For

                        <p>At the time of the original default on this loan El Salvador’s financial
                            position was such that the establishment of a Customs receivership to
                            enforce service on the loan would have resulted in chaos. Moreover, we
                            did not recognize the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> Government of El
                                Salvador.<pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0345"/>The situation was
                            further complicated by the formation of a private Bondholders Protective
                            Committee which, while zealous in seeking readjustment on behalf of the
                            bondholders, showed even more zeal in obtaining large personal profits.
                            However, so far as I can ascertain, the provision by which any
                            controversy which may arise in connection with the original loan
                            contract is to be referred through the Secretary of State to the Chief
                            Justice for his decision remains unmodified in law and practice. It
                            seems to me that the recent arrangement made by the Salvadoran
                            Government with the Banco Occidental is a dispute of the kind originally
                            contemplated by this provision of the loan contract. Unlike the
                            establishment of a Customs receivership, it appears questionable whether
                            reference of such a dispute to the Chief Justice could justly be
                            considered a derogation of Salvadoran sovereignty. The fact that a
                            request for such reference would be highly embarrassing both to the
                            Government of the United States and to that of El Salvador would not
                            appear to relieve them of their respective moral and legal obligations
                            to the bondholders. At a moment when El Salvador is financially able to
                            resume payments on its debt, and we are no longer embarrassed by the
                            probability that any representations on our part would redound to the
                            personal profit of the Protective Committee as well as to the protection
                            of the bondholders’ interests, would it be contrary to the long range
                            interests of the United States if representations were now made, in view
                            of the unethical act of a friendly country, for the protection of
                            innocent American bondholders?</p>
                        <p>Many of these bondholders bought their bonds in good faith, in the belief
                            that the role which the Department had voluntarily agreed to assume
                            would protect them against loss. They have nevertheless suffered heavy
                            losses. For good reasons of policy, the Department sidestepped the role
                            it had previously accepted; but also it has taken no effective action in
                            connection with acts of the Salvadoran Government prejudicial to the
                            bondholders’ legitimate interests. By this Government’s hostile attitude
                            towards the Protective Committee and by lending the Salvadoran
                            Government Exim funds we may have prejudiced them further. Every
                            concrete excuse for failing to fulfill our moral obligation to the
                            bondholders seems now to have vanished. Moreover, in view of the
                            reference in the recent letter of the Protective Committee to the
                            inactivity of the Department, it would not be surprising if we began to
                            receive complaints from bondholders and their Congressmen. I therefore
                            favor sending Mr. Thurston a somewhat more vigorous version of the draft
                            instruction I recently prepared for him directing him to make informal
                            representations regarding this matter.</p>

                        <p>As the Department intimated in its instruction no. 1044 of December 8,
                                1942,<note n="52" xml:id="d297fn54">Not printed.</note> it was
                            disturbed at the transaction described in the Legation’s despatch no.
                            3002 of November 3, 1942,<note n="52" xml:id="d297fn55">Not
                                printed.</note> by which the Salvadoran Government acquired a
                            considerable block of its defaulted bonds at a heavy discount through a
                            private arrangement with a Salvadoran bank. Since then the Salvadoran
                            Government has rejected the protests of the British Chargé d’Affaires
                            and the Protective Committee regarding this transaction. The Committee,
                            which had been legally empowered by a great majority of the bondholders
                            to represent their interests, has decided to dissolve. These events have
                            accentuated the Department’s misgivings regarding the manner in which
                            the interests of United States holders of Salvadoran bonds are being
                            affected. The Department believes that any funds available for
                            application to Salvadoran foreign indebtedness should first be applied
                            to the resumption of interest payments on this debt, rather than to the
                            repatriation at heavy discounts of bonds which are in complete default
                            and hopes that the Salvadoran Government will follow this course in the
                            future. Moreover, the purchase of a block of bonds from one holder at a
                            price considerably above the then existing market, and the payment of
                            interest on this purchase, would appear to discriminate against the
                            other holders.</p>
                        <p>The Department has also noted that the foreign exchange position of El
                            Salvador has improved very materially as a result of the increasingly
                            favorable Salvadoran trade balance. This favorable balance has been
                            largely derived from the sale of Salvadoran coffee to the United States
                            at the profitable prices brought about by the Inter-American Coffee
                                Agreement.<note n="53" xml:id="d297fn56">For text of this agreement,
                                see Department of State Treaty Series No. 979, or 56 Stat. (pt. 2)
                                1345.</note> Although the budgetary position of the Salvadoran
                            Government (as shown by the Legation’s reports) is not strong, the
                            general economic situation of the country appears to be sufficiently
                            sound to warrant consideration being given to the resumption of service,
                            at least in part, on its outstanding foreign obligations. It should not
                            be impossible, under the existing economic conditions in El Salvador,
                            for the Government to raise the necessary funds for this <pb n="333"
                                xml:id="pg_333" facs="0347"/>purpose. Should a satisfactory
                            arrangement be reached for the resumption of service on this debt, there
                            would then of course be no objection to further non-discriminatory
                            repatriation of the bonds.</p>
                        <p>The Legation is of course aware of the provisions affecting the Secretary
                            of State in the loan contract of June 24, 1922, to which the Department
                            consented. These provisions not only provided for the nomination by the
                            Fiscal Agent, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, of two
                            individuals, one of whom should be appointed by El Salvador as Collector
                            General of Customs in the event of a default, but also for reference to
                            the Chief Justice of the United States, through the Secretary, of any
                            disagreement regarding the contract. Many United States investors
                            doubtless purchased Salvadoran bonds on the strength of these
                            provisions, as inquiries from such investors have indicated. The
                            Department is concerned at the possibility that a further effort may now
                            be made by bondholders or the Fiscal Agent to invoke these provisions,
                            and desires to forestall any such contingency.</p>
                        <p>In view of the facts set forth above, the Department has considered it
                            appropriate to re-examine its position with respect to the existing
                            default on El Salvador bonds held by United States citizens. Unless you
                            perceive objection thereto, you are requested to bring the
                            considerations set forth above discreetly and informally to the
                            attention of the appropriate Salvadoran officials. You are authorized in
                            this connection to consult with Mr. Renwick.<note n="54"
                                xml:id="d297fn57">William W. Renwick, President of El Salvador’s
                                Committee of Economic Coordination and representative of the Fiscal
                                Agent under the foreign loan of 1922.</note> You may stress the fact
                            that in spite of the change in this Government’s policy which has
                            occurred since 1922, it would be embarrassing both to the United States
                            and to El Salvador if the bondholders should now invoke the provisions
                            of the 1922 loan contract, especially if this should come to be a matter
                            of public discussion in the United States and elsewhere. You may point
                            out that your Government wishes to prevent a situation arising which
                            might be prejudicial to the credit of El Salvador. You should then urge
                            that the Salvadoran Government seek an early opportunity to make an
                            arrangement with the bondholders or their representatives for the
                            resumption of service on its debt, or propose a plan of equitable
                            readjustment. You should not make any communication in writing to any
                            Salvadoran official in connection with this matter.</p>
                        <p>The Department appreciates that conversations may now be in progress
                            either between Salvadoran officials and Mr. Renwick or between the
                            Salvadoran and the British Governments, and you will of course carry out
                            the Department’s instructions in the light of the progress <pb n="334"

                            service by El Salvador on its outstanding bonds.</p>
                        <p>The Department notes that the Salvadoran Government contemplates
                            submitting to the American and British Governments a plan which is now
                            being prepared for adjustment of the debt. You are requested to make it
                            clear at an early opportunity to the appropriate Salvadoran authority
                            that it would be contrary to the Department’s policy for it to negotiate
                            a specific plan on behalf of the bondholders. The Department believes
                            that this [is] a matter which primarily concerns the Salvadoran
                            Government and the bondholders, and that it should therefore be
                            discussed directly between the competent Salvadoran officials and the
                            bondholders or their representatives, for example, the Foreign
                            Bondholders Protective Council, Incorporated, 90 Broad Street, New York,
                            with the standing of which the Government of El Salvador is familiar.
                            The purpose of the Department’s instruction was merely to make it clear
                            why the Department believed that the Salvadoran Government should seek
                            an early opportunity to initiate discussions with the bondholders or
                            their representatives looking to a resumption of service on the
                            outstanding debt.</p>

                            Department has naturally taken into account the scope of the legal
                            powers which an overwhelming majority of the bondholders had entrusted
                            to the Committee, and the primary responsibilities which consequently

                                that the Governments of the United States and Great Britain become
                                the creditors of El Salvador in lieu of the individual American and
                                British holders of Salvadoran external bonds; (2) that a further

                                be made; (3) that the price of coffee be stabilized; and (4) that

                            consistently declined to become involved in refunding plans for private
                            indebtedness contemplating the use of this Government’s funds. On the
                            other hand, there is no reason why the Salvadoran Government should not
                            propose to the bondholders or their representatives some link between
                            coffee prices and the level of service which that Government covenants

                            the policy of the Department of State does not permit it to negotiate

                            primarily concerns the Salvadoran Government and the bondholders—and
                            which, in consequence should be discussed directly between the competent
                            Salvadoran officials and the bondholders or their representatives.<pb

                            recalled our discussions of last year regarding the Salvadoran public
                            debt and stated that he was authorized to enter into preliminary

                            towards a definitive settlement. He stated that he had convinced the

                            essential, and although he is not empowered to conclude negotiations, he
                            is empowered to work out an arrangement which he would have to return to
                            El Salvador to confirm. He stated that he was anxious to handle the
                            Salvadoran situation in almost exactly the same terms as the Colombian
                            debt has been handled,<note n="65" xml:id="d300fn65">For correspondence

                            of service on the outstanding Salvadoran foreign bond indebtedness. Dr.
                            Bustamante presented the following plan to Dr. Munro: <list>

                            </list></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Dr. Bustamante and Dr. Munro discussed this proposition
                            at some length. Dr. Bustamante explained that his Government wished to
                            issue new bonds in order to abolish the Fiscal Agency, which was costing
                            the Salvadoran Government about $50,000 a year. He pointed out that this
                            could better be applied to service on the bonds. Dr. Munro intimated
                            that this would be advantageous, but pointed out that the Salvadoran
                            proposals would have to be accepted by substantially all of the
                            bondholders before the Agency could be abolished. He then said that the
                            interest rate proposed by the Salvadorans appeared to be rather low, and
                            that he felt that A bondholders would be unwilling to accept the same
                            treatment as that given the B and C bondholders. This seemed to be the
                            point in the Salvadoran plan which he was the least willing to accept.
                            Both he and Dr. Bustamante made all the points they could, most of which
                            were obvious, to support their respective theses. Eventually Dr.
                            Bustamante said that he would send Dr. Munro a memorandum explaining in
                            detail the Salvadoran Government’s proposals. They are planning to meet
                            again in New York or Princeton next week.</p>
                        <p>No mention was made in the talk of connecting debt service with coffee
                            prices. I refrained from any comment whatsoever in the course of the

                            debt of El Salvador, service of which is suspended.” Memoranda of
                            conversations on this subject between Dr. Bustamante and members of the
                            Department’s staff have already been transmitted to you.</p>
                        <p>It appears that Dr. Bustamante had not been authorized to negotiate on
                            any basis of settlement other than a uniform 3 percent interest rate
                            applicable alike on the 8 percent bonds of series A, and 6 percent
                            sterling bonds of series B, and the 7 percent bonds of series C, in
                            spite of the specific priority established in favor of the A bonds by
                            the 1922 contract, which has now returned to force through the failure
                            of the 1936 agreement, and in spite of the different interest rates the
                            three series of bonds have received both under the 1922 contract and the
                            1936 agreement. Under the circumstances little concrete progress toward
                            a new settlement was made, although the cordiality of the conversations
                            appears to have established a favorable basis for the conduct of future
                            negotiations between the Government of El Salvador and the Foreign
                            Bondholders Protective Council.</p>
                        <p>The Department continues greatly interested in the obtaining of an early
                            adjustment and regularization of the Salvadoran foreign debt. The
                            Department believes it should be possible to devise some proposal within
                            El Salvador’s capacity to pay which may be more acceptable to the
                            Council than a uniform 3 percent rate proposal unaccompanied by any
                            provisions offering holders of the higher ranking bonds some
                            compensation for the sacrifice of their prior rights and higher interest
                            rate. It is requested that the Embassy continue to manifest an active
                            interest in this matter and endeavor to promote an early resumption of
                            negotiations with the Council on terms taking into account the special
                            difficulties which the Council has seen in meeting Dr. Bustamante’s
                            first proposal.</p>

                        <p>A–354. Department’s instruction No. 309, September 1, 1943 (file
                            816.51/1157). I informed President Martínez this morning that my
                            Government had been gratified by Sr. Bustamante’s recent visit to the
                            United States in connection with the Salvadoran foreign debt and
                            regretted that the terms he offered to the Foreign Bondholders
                            Protective Council had been such as to make a settlement impossible at
                            that time. I added that we were greatly interested in obtaining an early
                            adjustment and regularization of the debt problem and trusted that there
                            might be an early resumption of negotiations with the Council.</p>
                        <p>President Martínez immediately assured me that this matter has been
                            receiving the attention of his Government and that it has been decided
                            to have Sr. Bustamante return to the United States in October with full
                            powers to negotiate an agreement. The President implied that Sr.
                            Bustamante will be authorized to propose a settlement on the basis of
                            50% of the contract interest on each series of bonds.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Bustamante of El Salvador has arrived to negotiate a debt settlement
                            with Professor Dana Munro. He called on me this morning and we held a
                            meeting with Mr. Livesey and Mr. Collado.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Livesey arranged an appointment for Dr. Bustamante with Professor
                            Munro for 11 a.m., December 1 in New York. It was not possible to start
                            negotiations earlier because Dr. Valdés,<note n="68" xml:id="d304fn68"
                                >V. Manuel Valdés, Central Reserve Bank employee.</note> who is
                            accompanying Dr. Bustamante on his mission and who has the required
                            statistical information, has hurt his foot in New Orleans and will not
                            be on hand before that date.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Bustamante said that he was empowered to offer a settlement along the
                            lines discussed last summer, except that the provision regarding
                            interest would be modified to offer half of the original contractual <pb
                                n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0354"/>rates on the three series of
                            bonds. I certainly trust that Professor Munro will accept these terms,
                            but I fear that we may have some difficulty with the British in view of
                            the fact that the Salvadoran proposal would reverse the relative
                            treatment of the “B” and “C” series bonds by comparison with the 1936
                            settlement. Dr. Bustamante appeared fully determined to effect a
                            settlement. He mentioned the fact that special taxes were being imposed
                            to provide for the debt service and that the major item, an increased
                            coffee tax which should yield about $1,500,000 per annum at present
                            prices, had already been enacted. Even making full provision for the
                            proposed interest, and even allowing for a substantial rise in the price
                            of the bonds (now about 40 according to Dr. Bustamante) upon the
                            consummation of the settlement, this should mean a very substantial debt
                            retirement every year so long as the present coffee situation prevails.
                            It should also have the happy effect of retarding inflationary trends in
                            El Salvador.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Señor Bustamante</hi>: At our conference
                            yesterday you asked me to give you a memorandum of my understanding of
                            the purport of our recent conversations regarding the resumption of
                            service on the dollar bonds of El Salvador.</p>
                        <p>As I understand it, the Government of El Salavador proposes to pay
                            interest on the dollar and sterling bonds at present outstanding at
                            one-half of the rates fixed by the contract of 1922. The Government
                            would provide a minimum of $800,000 U.S. Currency per annum for interest
                            and amortization on the A, B and C bonds now outstanding, not including
                            those which have been or are being purchased by the Government. So much
                            of this sum as was not needed for interest service would be used for the
                            purchase of bonds in the market, or by drawings at par if the bonds sold
                            over par, all bonds so purchased to be cancelled. I also understand that
                            the Government plans to use the proceeds of the new coffee export tax
                            exclusively for the service of its now outstanding debts, so that a
                            considerable sum would be available for additional amortization in years
                            when coffee prices were good. On the other hand it would be stipulated
                            that amortization in excess of contractual requirements in any given
                            year might be taken into account in calculating amortization
                            requirements in subsequent years.</p>
                        <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0355"/>
                        <p>45% of such portion of the $800,000 annual service fund as was available
                            for amortization would be applied to the retirement of the new 4% bonds
                            and 30% to the retirement of the new 3½% bonds. All bonds would be
                            retired within thirty years from January 1, 1944.</p>
                        <p>The back interest on bonds which did not receive payments under the
                                1933<note n="70" xml:id="d305fn70">A temporary agreement signed <hi

                            payments were being made under these plans, would be paid in cash at the
                            rates provided in the plans. Back interest on all of the dollar bonds,
                            from the time when payments under the 1936 plan ceased, would be
                            satisfied by the issue of new 3½% bonds to an amount equal to one-half
                            of the arrears calculated at the rates of the 1922 contract.</p>
                        <p>Outstanding scrip would be paid in cash at fifteen per cent of the face
                            value.</p>
                        <p>The new plan would become effective as of January 1, 1944. The
                            registration requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission
                            might make it impossible actually to make an offer to the bondholders by
                            that date but the new bonds would in any event be dated January 1,
                            1944.</p>
                        <p>The bondholders accepting the plan would agree to the abolition of the
                            office of the Fiscal Agent.</p>
                        <p>I am authorized to say that the Council would recommend that the holders
                            of the dollar bonds accept a settlement along the above lines. As I told
                            you, the Council is not authorized to negotiate for the holders of the
                            sterling bonds. I have, however, informed the President of the British
                            Council of Foreign Bondholders of the tenor of our conversation, since
                            you requested me to do this.</p>
                        <p>In cases where the Council negotiates and recommends a permanent
                            settlement it requests the debtor government to include in the law or
                            decree authorizing the resumption of service a provision instructing the
                            Government’s paying agents to deduct and remit to the Council, from the
                            first monies paid to each bondholder, a sum equal to one-eighth of one
                            per cent of the original face value of his bonds, or $1.25 per thousand
                            dollar bond.</p>

                            proposal to transfer to the Guatemalan Government the defense
                            installations in Puerto Barrios and to withdraw our forces from that
                            port.</p>
                        <p>On December 21 General Brett paid a courtesy call on President Ubico. In
                            the course of the conversation President Ubico proposed the replacement
                            of certain United States forces by Guatemalan troops. It has now been
                            decided by our Military Authorities that the artillery installations at
                            Puerto Barrios can be turned over to the Guatemalans and that there is
                            no longer any need to continue our detachment at that point.</p>
                        <p>Lt. Colonel Glenn Frum, G. S. C, representing General Brett, came to
                            Guatemala to discuss the proposed withdrawal of our forces. In
                            consultation with the Commanding Officer of the local Army Base<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d306fn3">Col. Lauth, Commander at Puerto
                                Barrios.</note> it was agreed that it would be necessary to refer to
                            Washington certain aspects of the proposed transfer, and consequently,
                            no discussions of the subject have been held with the Guatemalan
                            authorities. It is not doubted, however, that they will accept our
                            proposal, if satisfactory financial arrangements can be made.</p>
                        <p>The Legation’s despatch No. 2901 of May 27, 1942, transmitted the text of

                            documents referred to.</p>
                        <p>It will also be necessary to provide through the customary channels for
                            the transfer to Guatemala under the Lend-Lease Agreement of the
                            artillery installations now in Puerto Barrios. It is not known whether
                            the charge for this equipment will be part of the three million dollars
                            of equipment which we have agreed to furnish Guatemala without charge,
                            or, in the event that this sum has already been obligated by Guatemalan
                            requests, whether it will then be sold to Guatemala as part of the
                            additional amount of two million dollars of equipment established in the
                            Lend-Lease Agreement. In the latter event it is assumed that the price
                            to be fixed will take into consideration the fact that the equipment is
                            not new and that Guatemala will also be entitled to a reduction of 40%
                            from the scheduled price of the equipment.</p>
                        <p>It is recommended that we transfer without cost to the Guatemalan
                            Government all the installations and equipment of a fixed nature as
                            contemplated in numbered paragraph 4 of the note of November 16,
                                1942,<note n="6" xml:id="d306fn6">Note No. 337, from the American
                                Minister in Guatemala to the Guatemalan Minister for Foreign

                                        >ibid.</hi>, p. 443</ref>.</note> in view of the fact that
                            such property would in any event accrue to the Guatemalan Government
                            upon our withdrawal from Puerto Barrios after the war. The proposed
                            withdrawal from Puerto Barrios will undoubtedly establish a precedent
                            for our future withdrawal from the base at Guatemala City and it is
                            suggested that our arrangements be worked out with that in mind. If we
                            are to derive full benefit from this gesture we should nevertheless not
                            remove from our installations at Puerto Barrios any material or
                            equipment which the Government of Guatemala would feel should properly
                            be included in the transfer. Both Lt. Colonel From and Colonel Lauth,
                            Commander of the local Base, are in agreement with this
                            recommendation.</p>
                        <p>President Ubico is understood to have suggested to General Brett that a
                            small training cadre composed of the requisite number of United States
                            Army personnel be retained at Puerto Barrios for the period necessary to
                            train the Guatemalan detachment which will take over our installations
                            there. It is assumed that the War Department will wish to have adequate
                            provision for that purpose included in the suggested exchange of notes
                            with the Guatemalan Government.</p>
                        <p>I am confident that the withdrawal of our forces from Puerto Barrios will
                            be appreciated by the Guatemalan Government as a <pb n="344"
                                xml:id="pg_344" facs="0358"/>gesture of cooperation on our part and
                            will also have a helpful psychological effect on the people of
                            Guatemala.</p>
                        <p>There is some fear in Guatemala and perhaps in other countries of Latin
                            America where we maintain military detachments, that our forces will not
                            be withdrawn after the war, a fear which is doubtless held even by many
                            sincere friends of the United States. It is believed that our withdrawal
                            from Puerto Barrios, while of no major strategic importance, should help
                            to counteract this apprehension, I have suggested to Lt. Col. Frum that
                            General Brett might wish to arrange an appropriate ceremony on the
                            occasion of our transfer of the Puerto Barrios installations to
                            Guatemala and that he might be willing to come to Guatemala to attend
                            the ceremony. The War Department might consider it desirable to give
                            suitable publicity to the transfer because of the psychological factor
                            which I have mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Lt. Colonel Frum informs me that he is submitting a report to General
                            Brett on this subject on his return to the Canal Zone tomorrow and I
                            assume that an appropriate communication will be forwarded to the War
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>I shall await the Department’s instructions.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Very Esteemed Mr. President</hi>: Your Excellency
                            is aware that the Government of Guatemala, in fulfillment of
                            international obligations and as a pleasant duty of friendship and
                            cooperation toward the United States of America, has placed all its aid
                            and its resources at the service of the common war effort, within the
                            limit of its means.</p>
                        <p>As a part of that cooperation it viewed with pleasure the establishment
                            by military forces of the United States on bases on Guatemalan
                            territory, among them one (which was) indispensable for the defense of
                            the Atlantic Coast of the country and of its principal way of access:
                            Puerto Barrios.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, Guatemalan troops have been perfecting their training
                            to the point that, with the necessary efficiency, they have been able to
                            take charge of the base in Puerto Barrios with its installations and
                            military equipment, which they have received the 24th of the present

                        <p>The Secretary of State advises that it is the desire of the Department to
                            formulate as soon as possible a definite program for dealing with the
                            1942–43 crop of Proclaimed List Guatemalan coffee, and, if possible, to
                            secure in this connection the adoption by the Guatemalan Government of
                            legislation implementing more completely Resolution VII of the

                            of the ownership of business properties and enterprises by persons on

                        <p>The Department feels that more effective results toward such end will be
                            achieved if the initiative for the formulation of a definitive program
                            were left, as far as possible, to the Guatemalan Government itself.</p>
                        <p>Any program formulated, either with respect to a broad implementation of
                            Resolution VII or to a specific program for dealing with the 1942–43
                            Proclaimed List coffee crop, should take into account the following
                            considerations: <list>

                                <item>This Government has consistently maintained the position that
                                    the sanctions of the Proclaimed List must be upheld to the
                                    fullest extent compatible with the exigencies of the local
                                    situation. This Government is nevertheless again prepared to
                                    permit the importation of Proclaimed List coffee to fill the
                                    1943 quota, but coffee produced on non-Proclaimed List <hi
                                        rend="italic">fincas</hi> must be given preference. In this
                                    connection, the Department is informed that the non-Proclaimed
                                    List coffee production will nearly fill the 1943 quota. For the
                                    Legation’s <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0361"/>information,
                                    it is the Department’s position that the 20 percent agreement
                                    embodied in the 1941–42 program<note n="10" xml:id="d309fn10"

                                    a 1942–43 program. Further, the United States War Department
                                    will not be permitted to purchase additional Proclaimed List
                                    non-quota coffee as long as non-Proclaimed List coffee can be
                                    obtained elsewhere and, considering present Army stocks, it
                                    appears that enough of the latter coffee can be obtained for
                                    foreseeable needs.</item>

                                <item>The only fully satisfactory and permanent solution of the
                                    problem of how to deal with the 1942–43 Proclaimed List coffee
                                    crop would seem to be through the effective elimination of all
                                    ownership interest of Proclaimed List nationals in business
                                    enterprises and properties. If the <hi rend="italic">fincas</hi>
                                    now owned by undesirable persons were vested by the Guatemalan
                                    Government or transferred to desirable parties, this Government
                                    could then, consistently with its Proclaimed List policy permit
                                    the importation of coffee produced on <hi rend="italic"
                                        >fincas</hi> formerly owned by Proclaimed List nationals as
                                    quota coffee. Not only would the quota problem thus be solved
                                    but this Government might well be interested in arranging for
                                    purchases of non-quota coffee as heretofore.</item>

                                <item>A program for eliminating completely all ownership interests
                                    of Proclaimed List nationals in business enterprises would
                                    effectively implement Resolution VII and would thus further the
                                    joint policy of the respective governments of the Western
                                    Hemisphere of strengthening hemispheric defense. The retention
                                    of ownership by persons on the Proclaimed List involves the
                                    danger that such persons may still be able to assert some
                                    control over present operations of their businesses and leaves a
                                    present expectancy to such persons which may enable them to
                                    continue to assert an undesirable influence in local affairs. If
                                    a satisfactory plan were developed and effectively implemented
                                    for eliminating such ownership, this Government would be
                                    prepared to delete from the Proclaimed List the businesses of
                                    Proclaimed List nationals in Guatemala who were subjected to the
                                    plan. In addition, this Government would review the Proclaimed

                                    such a plan was under way, persons and firms who have been
                                    guilty of only minor undesirable acts, such as trading with, and
                                    isolated cloaking transactions on behalf of, Proclaimed List

                                <item>It is realized that the adoption of such a program by the
                                    Guatemalan Government might result in the loss of the present $4
                                    coffee tax, but since the entire revenues from the <hi

                                    accrue to it, there would be, as a practical matter, no loss of
                                    revenue. Even upon a transfer of the <hi rend="italic"
                                        >fincas</hi> to desirable persons, the proceeds of the sale

                                    through investment of the proceeds in bonds or through taxation.
                                    Thus the injury to the local economy would be held at a minimum
                                    and there would be no loss in value of the <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>The Legation will note that the considerations set forth above approach
                            the problem of a more complete implementation of Resolution VII through
                            the specific problem of how to deal with the 1942–43 coffee crop. The
                            question could, of course, be raised in exactly the opposite manner,
                            that is by discussing the broad problem of the desirability of
                            implementing more completely Resolution VII without reference to this
                            year’s coffee crop (although the specific problem would probably arise
                            in the course of any discussions).</p>
                        <p>The Legation is authorized in its discretion to bring the foregoing
                            matters and considerations to the attention of the appropriate
                            Guatemalan authorities in such manner as it deems most appropriate to
                            attain the results desired. It is realized that specific problems will
                            arise in connection with the adoption of any far-reaching program, but
                            if the Guatemalan Government proves willing to take action, these can be
                            dealt with as they arise. As noted above, the Department desires the
                            initiative for the formulation of a definitive program be left, as far
                            as possible, to the Guatemalan Government itself. The Legation is
                            requested to keep the Department fully informed of any discussions held
                            and the results thereof.</p>

                            properties. The Minister for Foreign Affairs<note n="13"
                                xml:id="d310fn13">Carlos Salazar.</note> has on several occasions
                            said quite definitely that the Government of Guatemala fully realizes
                            the danger of permitting such a large portion of the national economy to
                            fall into hands of any single nationality and that it is its firm
                            intention to effect the nationalization of enemy alien properties. Dr.
                            Salazar stated that he had given this matter serious study over a long
                            period of time and as long ago as October 1942 had submitted to
                            President Ubico a plan which he had prepared. He explained that only
                            recently it had come to his attention that this document had been lost
                            in the President’s office but indicated that arrangements will be made
                            promptly to bring it to the President’s attention.</p>
                        <p>Licenciado Salazar explained that his proposal was for the Government to
                            take over all enemy-owned property without, however, making direct
                            compensation to the owners. In order to conform to the Constitutional
                            prohibition on expropriation without compensation he proposed to set up
                            against the German Government a claim for direct and indirect damages
                            arising out of the war which would at least offset the actual value of
                            the properties to be expropriated. He said that it was his hope that
                            Guatemala would have this problem settled before the peace conference at
                            the end of the war.</p>
                        <p>From conversations with the Foreign Minister and other Guatemalan
                            officials it is my impression that the Government has not settled on any
                            definite plan for the actual operation and administration of such
                            properties. Several officials have expressed the opinion that the
                            Government would not be competent to operate them although no
                            satisfactory alternate plan has been mentioned.</p>
                        <p>It has been apparent from various conversations with the Foreign Minister
                            that the problem of the disposition of the CAPCO<note n="14"
                                xml:id="d310fn14">Central American Plantations Corporation,
                                organized under the laws of Delaware. The Alien Property Custodian,
                                acting in behalf of CAPCO, at this time was negotiating a contract,
                                signed April 19, 1943, with the Guatemalan Government whereby all of
                                the physical assets of the Corporation in Guatemala consisting
                                primarily of coffee plantations and their equipment would be
                                transferred to Guatemala. In return, Guatemala would assume certain
                                indebtedness of the Corporation and grant to CAPCO a 30–year right
                                to utilize one of the plantations for cinchona production. A
                                majority of shares of CAPCO common stock were owned at this time,
                                directly or indirectly, by nationals and residents of
                                Germany.</note> properties, which, as the Department is aware, is
                            now in the process of negotiation, is closely involved with the
                            Government’s plan for nationalization of other enemy property. It is
                            apparently the Government’s view that it will be necessary to set up
                            some quasi-governmental agency to operate CAPCO properties with which
                            the remaining properties can be integrated.</p>
                        <p>While there are reasonable expectations that the CAPCO problem will be
                            settled in the near future the Foreign Minister has indicated <pb
                                n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0364"/>clearly that the major
                            nationalization plan will require considerable time to be placed in
                            effect in view of the legal technicalities involved in transferring land
                            titles. In a recent conversation he informed me that President Ubico had
                            instructed him to take up with me the situation of the Proclaimed List
                            coffee, pointing out that the Government was concerned with the revenue
                            from the taxation involved as well as the continued operation by the
                            intervention system. I assured the Minister that the problem would
                            receive our sympathetic consideration and in response to his invitation
                            I have informally requested him to obtain detailed information with
                            regard to the status of the accounts of intervened <hi rend="italic"
                                >fincas.</hi></p>
                        <p>It is obvious that the proposed nationalization plan will be delayed for
                            some time and in the meanwhile it is anticipated that we will be
                            subjected to increasing pressure from the Government with regard to the
                            disposition of Proclaimed List coffee. According to figures collected by
                            the Commercial Attaché the production of coffee on non-Proclaimed List
                                <hi rend="italic">fincas</hi> during this crop year appears to be
                            adequate to fill the present United States import coffee quota assigned
                            to Guatemala. The present quota against which shipment can be made
                            amounts to 784,000 quintales, after deducting the total carry-over
                            shipped to the United States and held in Guatemala from the previous
                            crop year amounting to 87,000 quintales. The current crop year is
                            reliably estimated to exceed previous crop years by approximately 10%.
                            If the crop estimates are borne out it therefore appears that no
                            Proclaimed List coffee can move within this year’s quota.</p>
                        <p>As a stop-gap measure it has occurred to me that we might wish to suggest
                            to the Guatemalan Government the possibility of providing by decree for
                            the expropriation of all coffee and other products from Proclaimed List
                                <hi rend="italic">fincas</hi> until such time as adequate measures
                            for their nationalization can be carried out. In this way the Guatemalan
                            Government would obtain all income from the properties and the interest
                            of the German owners in current production would be eliminated. Such a
                            proposal on our part might well be accompanied by an offer to assist in
                            arranging for the sale of 20% of the global amount of Proclaimed List
                            coffee outside of the quota to an appropriate United States Government
                            agency. By withholding action on our part on the remaining 80% of
                            Proclaimed List coffee the Guatemalan Government would doubtless realize
                            the necessity for expediting their consideration of the nationalization
                            program. From a conversation which I have had with the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs I am inclined to believe that such a suggestion would be
                            favorably received.</p>

                        <p>Agricultural properties of Proclaimed List nationals producing coffee are
                            now directly intervened through the medium of the Department of

                            economy of the country becomes apparent.</p>
                        <p>Few industrial concerns figure on the Proclaimed List and as yet no

                        <p>While certain measures had been adopted as early as October of 1941, the
                            basic Guatemalan restrictions aiming at control over the economic and
                            financial operations of undesirable persons derive from Decree No. 2655
                            which was dated December 23, 1941 (published in <hi rend="italic">Diario

                            known and hereafter referred to as the “Emergency Law”. Section 3,
                            Articles 14 to 24 inclusive of this law establishes restrictions of an
                            economic nature. Prohibited activities include all commercial and
                            financial operations with enemy countries; commercial and financial
                            transactions which occur within the country and in which blocked
                            nationals might have an interest, except under Government license;

                            country involving individuals, groups or associations who injure or act
                            inimically toward the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Domestic banks,
                            except under specific license, cannot effect payments, transfers or
                            withdrawals of funds if any of the countries with which Guatemala is at
                            war, or a national of such countries, has an interest in said
                            operations. The deposits, credits and current accounts of nationals of
                            countries at war with Guatemala and of persons figuring in the

                        <p>Blocked nationals and also Proclaimed List nationals are, however,

                            long as they neither contravene the laws, regulations or ordinances of
                            the Republic, nor engage in activities menacing the security of the
                            nation or the integrity of its institutions. The Emergency Law further
                            provides for the supervision, intervention and direct control over any

                            intervention of the coffee properties of Proclaimed List nationals, and
                            in the collection of the special war tax assessed against the exported
                            product of such <hi rend="italic">fincas</hi>, in effect diverted the
                            largest proportion of the profits that would ordinarily accrue to the
                            Proclaimed List nationals who are subject to these controls. The Central
                            Bank is currently setting aside 1.67 percent of the proceeds derived
                            from the sale of Proclaimed List coffee, and this amount is blocked in
                            the names of the Proclaimed List owners and a further deterrent toward
                            the accumulation of sizeable amounts in the blocked accounts is the fact
                            that in many cases withdrawals are permitted from these funds for the
                            subsistence of the owners, in conformity with prevailing legislation.
                            The percentage mentioned as set aside for blocking represents
                            approximately 0.20 of a quetzal for each quintal of clean coffee
                            sold.</p>
                        <p>In approaching the objective of eliminating from the economic life of the

                            whose activities are, or have been, inimical to the security of the
                            Western Hemisphere, it will be observed that property rights of
                            Proclaimed List nationals still vest in their original owners and no
                            provision has been made whereby the Guatemalan Government may undertake
                            to vest any of these properties. Commercial establishments of Proclaimed
                            List nationals continue to operate and have not been intervened,
                            although their funds are subject to the blocking procedure. The
                            Government has, none-the-less, the power to liquidate inimical
                            enterprises and the desirability of re-nationalizing these properties
                            has been enunciated in the Central Bank’s official publication <hi
                                rend="italic">Revista de la Economía Nacional</hi> (No. 66), (Año
                            VI, June 1942, pp. 12–16).</p>
                        <p>The influence of the German Colony in Guatemala has, notwithstanding the
                            circumstances that titles have in but few instances been transferred to
                            desirable persons, been definitely weakened under the interventor
                            system. The agricultural properties which are operated under the
                            interventor procedure are managed by an Administrador who is a direct
                            employee of the Department of Intervened <hi rend="italic">Fincas</hi>.
                            This official resides on the property and is in addition to the Bank’s
                            fiscal agent, the Interventor. Former German employees of the <hi
                                rend="italic">fincas</hi> have been dismissed and the properties are
                            in reality directly operated by the Guatemalan Government through the
                            Banco Central as respects coffee <hi rend="italic">fincas</hi>, and
                            through the Crédito Hipotecario Nacional for all other intervened
                            properties. Since Guatemala’s declaration of war 278 enemy aliens have
                            been deported, 333 Germans have been repatriated <pb n="354"
                                xml:id="pg_354" facs="0368"/>and at the present writing plans are
                            under way for additional repatriations.</p>
                        <p>The policy of the Central Bank and the conduct of its interventor system
                            is in the direction of expending as administration and maintenance
                            charges the largest proportion of the proceeds derived from the sale of
                            produce from the Proclaimed List coffee <hi rend="italic">fincas</hi> so
                            that in reality the blocked accounts are being kept at what may be
                            considered a reasonable minimum. The condition of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >fincas</hi> as a whole was not, according to the Central Bank, as
                            good as was expected in view of the generally accepted hypothesis that
                            Nazi-German efficiency in management and operation was superior to that
                            of Guatemalan nationals. The Germans had not, it is claimed, kept their
                            farms up to Guatemalan standards so that unexpected expenditures have
                            been necessary to put the <hi rend="italic">fincas</hi> in good
                            shape.</p>
                        <p>In point of fact, the total amount of the funds blocked in the Central
                            Bank in the name of blocked and particularly of Proclaimed List
                            nationals, while such sums naturally increased from the proceeds derived
                            from the 1941–42 coffee crop, have now diminished to what may be
                            considered a reasonable minimum.</p>
                        <p>The problem now confronting Guatemala is the orderly disposal of the
                            1942–43 crop from these intervened Proclaimed List properties.</p>

                        <p>The Department has been informed that the War Department is now
                            interested in purchasing through a single contract for use in the United
                            States the entire 1942/43 Guatemalan Proclaimed List coffee crop. This
                            suggestion rests upon the fact that such coffee could be shipped
                            directly to the West Coast, thus obviating the necessity of shipping
                            coffee needed in that area by rail from the East Coast. The War
                            Department has also informed the Department that it is prepared to pay
                            current prices, and that, because of the size of the contract, it would
                            prefer the contract to be handled by a single importer in <pb n="355"
                                xml:id="pg_355" facs="0369"/>this country, probably the same person
                            that handled the War Department’s contract last year.</p>
                        <p>The Department perceives no objection to the purchase of the entire crop
                            through a single contract for Army needs, provided (<hi rend="italic"

                            are not permitted to jeopardize the successful conclusion of the
                            formulation of a plan for eliminating any Proclaimed List interest in
                            the coffee along the lines outlined in previous communications and (<hi

                            to other purchasers. In the latter connection it is understood that the
                            War Department has been purchasing its coffee requirements in the open
                            market without preferential treatment.</p>

                            I have the honor to enclose copy and translation of Guatemalan Foreign
                            Office Note No. 5298 of April 15,<note n="18" xml:id="d313fn19">Not

                            Proclaimed List plantations.</p>
                        <p>The principal emphasis in the Guatemalan note is on the Government’s
                            desire to obtain a solution of the problem of the disposition of
                            Proclaimed List coffee and only incidentally gives assurances regarding
                            the participation of the owners in the profits derived from the sale of
                            such coffee. In addition, as pointed out in my telegram, the Government
                            indicates that it would be disposed to increase the present “war tax” on
                            Proclaimed List coffee in the event that higher prices should be
                            obtained this year. The note omits any reference to the Guatemalan
                            Government’s intentions with respect to expropriation or vesting of
                            Proclaimed List properties.</p>
                        <p>In a conversation with the President yesterday he stated that the
                            Guatemalan Government could not constitutionally proceed to
                            expropriation of Proclaimed List properties at the present time but at
                            the Peace Conference his Government would present to the Axis Powers a
                            bill for claims arising from the War which would be in excess <pb
                                n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0370"/>of the value of the Proclaimed
                            List properties. He added that the properties would then be expropriated
                            and that the owners would have to look to the German Government for
                            payment. This present attitude of the President is considered to be less
                            satisfactory than the position previously taken by the Foreign Minister
                            who had indicated that the Government was prepared to proceed promptly
                            with expropriation. The reason for this change in attitude is not
                            known.</p>
                        <p>The statement of the Guatemalan Foreign Office to the effect that the
                            owners of Proclaimed List properties are receiving minimum benefits from
                            the sale of coffee is borne out by the data which were transmitted to
                            the Department with the Legation’s despatch No. 3774 of April 8.<note
                                n="21" xml:id="d313fn20">Not printed.</note> In the event that the
                            Department decides to authorize the importation into the United States
                            of Proclaimed List coffee it is believed that the size of the profits
                            accruing to the owners will be at least as small as for the previous
                            crop year. If the profits are larger than considered desirable it is
                            believed that the Government of Guatemala would be prepared to carry out
                            its suggestion of imposing an increased “war tax” on the sale of
                            Proclaimed List coffee. In fact it is currently rumored that the “war
                            tax” will be increased within the next few days from the present rate of
                            $4.00 to $5.00 per quintal.</p>
                        <p>While the failure of the Guatemalan Government to proceed with
                            expropriation of Proclaimed List properties is a source of
                            disappointment it is not believed that it would be possible at this time
                            to obtain any more satisfactory assurances than contained in the
                            enclosed note and I recommend that I be authorized to inform the
                            Guatemalan Government that sales of the current Proclaimed List coffee
                            crop will be permitted.</p>

                            Such approval is based upon the assurances received from the Guatemalan
                            Government with respect to the continuation of the control program and
                            such coffee can, of course, be imported only in accordance with its
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested, however, that, before any notification is given as to
                            the approval of the plan, you arrange for the delivery to you, on as
                            current a basis as possible, of all data (such as a list of all sales

                            by you from time to time in the future that the control plan is being
                            adhered to and whether further action would be desirable at any time in
                            order to reduce to a minimum the profits to be credited to the blocked
                            accounts of the Proclaimed List owners of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >fincas</hi>. In view of the difficulties encountered in obtaining
                            such figures this year, you may, in your discretion, wish to obtain
                            written assurances from the Guatemalan authorities that such data will
                            be promptly forthcoming in the future upon request.</p>
                        <p>In addition, with reference to the proposal of the Guatemalan Government
                            to defer nationalization of Proclaimed List <hi rend="italic"
                                >fincas</hi> until after the war, it is suggested that, in your
                            discretion, you continue to point out the desirability of legislation
                            which will permit more immediate action against the dangerous firms on
                            the Proclaimed List.</p>

                            properties on the Proclaimed List and intervened by the Banco Central.

                            taken to advise the Guatemalan Government that the Proclaimed List
                            coffee crop for 1942–43 would be permitted to enter the United States,
                            and to give all American firms, or their representatives, in Guatemala
                            simultaneous notice that this coffee might be purchased without specific
                            license. Copies of the communications with the Foreign Office and the
                            letters to the trade will show that at no time did this Embassy give any
                            indication whatsoever of preference as to the manner in which the Banco
                            Central should sell the coffee, or the customers to whom it should be
                            sold. The report received by the Department, as stated in the
                            Department’s Telegram No. 276 of May 25, to the effect that our
                            Government was insisting on a public auction of the coffee, was a
                            complete misrepresentation of fact.</p>
                        <p>It was realized that the Army was anxious to get this block of coffee,
                            and this Embassy would have been glad to do anything consistent with our
                            instructions, to assist the Army to secure it. Purchases of other
                            foodstuffs which the Army needs have been discussed with the
                            Quartermaster Corps’ local representative and any assistance possible
                            rendered him. It is difficult to understand why, when the Army has one
                            of its own men here as a purchasing representative, it could not have
                            instructed him to buy this coffee, thus avoiding the large profit for
                            the agent. The fact that this was not done, and that the purchase was
                            handled as it was, has created such a generally unfavorable impression
                            that it is felt that the Department should be advised of the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The note submitted by this Embassy to the Guatemalan Foreign Office was
                            handed as a public document, to the Coffee Advisory Board, so that it
                            should have been recognized that we had specifically asked for equal
                            treatment for all coffee buyers, American and Guatemalan alike. However,
                            there is strong evidence to support the report that considerable
                            resentment is felt against the Embassy in local coffee circles, and that
                            even in fairly high Guatemalan Government circles the impression exists
                            that we were instrumental in securing the business for Mr. Medina. The
                            exclusive way in which the Army handled the business, and the fact that
                            the Ministry of Finance took the matter out of the hands of the Banco
                            Central, have also been widely criticized. <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361"
                                facs="0375"/>It is reported that better prices could have been
                            secured for the coffee, and the repeated accusation of under-grading on
                            the types of coffee purchased is taken as an indication of excessive
                            profits to be made on the transaction. This Embassy is not in a position
                            to vouch for these statements, nor can it deny them. The fact that they
                            are current is considered extremely unfortunate.</p>

                                party,<note n="6" xml:id="d318fn6">Under the terms of article 6 of
                                the loan agreement of September 9, 1942, between the Republic of
                                Honduras, the Banco de Honduras, and the Export-Import Bank of
                                Washington, the Bank’s loan was secured, in the last contingency, by
                                income from consular fees. For text of agreement, see Department of

                            Londres, in the payment of the 3% fee of 1926, and may be under the
                            impression that the 2% of 1930 and even possibly the 3% of 1942 are also
                            part of its guarantee. At the same time, it seems rather incongruous
                            that the U.S. Government and the Honduran Government should, in order to
                            construct the Inter-American Highway, be forced to pay the Corporación
                            de Tenedores de Bonos de Londres, and perhaps later, the Export-Import
                            Bank itself. In any case, a good deal of needless accounting and
                            bookkeeping might possibly be avoided by appropriate negotiations at
                            this time.</p>

                        <p>There are enclosed herewith copies of a letter of April 9, 1943, from Mr.
                            E. W. James to Mr. W. H. Schwiesow.<note n="14" xml:id="d320fn16">Will
                                H. Schwiesow, Associate Highway Engineer, U.S. Public Roads
                                Administration, stationed at this time in Honduras. Letter not

                        <p>It is noted that instead of proposing a manner of waiving the consular
                            fees of 8% as vigorously demanded by the highway contractors and as
                            reported in the Legation’s despatch No. 2624, Mr. James has merely
                            suggested that the full 8% consular fees be paid.</p>
                        <p>As explained in the Legation’s No. 2624, it does not appear that the full
                            8% should be paid in any case. In addition, attention is directed to the
                            fact that even the payment of the three percent would constitute in
                            effect: (1) payment to the London Bond Holders Council of one-third the
                            amount of the fee on all imports for the construction of the Honduran
                            section of the Inter-American Highway by the Honduran Government, and
                            (2) payment to the London Bond Holders Council of two-thirds the amount
                            of the fee on all imports for the construction of the Honduran section
                            of the Inter-American Highway by the United States Government. Assuming,
                            for example, that there will be imported $2,000,000 worth of materials
                            for the Highway, there would be paid to the London Bond Holders Council
                            from the three percent fee, $60,000, of which the United States
                            Government would pay $40,000. This illustration is predicated on the
                            assumption that the amounts collected are needed for the semi-annual
                            payments to the London Bondholders.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that the full 8% has until the present been waived by
                            the Honduran Government in response to demands by the Highway
                            contractors direct to the Ministry of Finance and the President. The
                            Legation would appreciate additional instructions at as early a date as
                            possible indicating whether or not the United States Government is
                            willing to make this donation to the Honduran Government.</p>

                            no. 2910 of April 26, 1943, regarding the 8% consular fee which the
                            Honduran authorities wish to charge on material imported for the
                            Inter-American Highway work.</p>
                        <p>In view of your explanation that the Honduran Government has already
                            acceded to demands of the highway contractors that the entire 8%
                            consular charge be waived, the Department will accept this situation.
                            The Public Roads Administration, on being consulted, also signified its
                            assent to the maintenance of the present situation. You may therefore
                            disregard the Department’s instruction no. 1218 of April 16, 1943.<note

                        <p>For your confidential information, the Department is somewhat concerned
                            at the financial and psychological effect which this waiver may have on
                            Honduras, which has suffered more than any other Central American
                            country from war-engendered economic dislocations. The Department does
                            not feel that this consideration is of sufficient importance to warrant
                            re-opening the question. It does, however, desire that you keep its
                            views in mind in the event that the question should arise again in any
                            form, and it wishes you to keep it informed of any developments which

                        <p>The Embassy regrets that its despatch No. 2910 seems to have been
                            interpreted as implying that the Honduran Government has acceded to
                            demands of the highway contractors that the entire 8% consular charge be
                            waived. The Embassy merely stated that, “It should be noted that the
                            full 8% has until the present been waived by the Honduran Government in
                            response to the demands by the Highway contractors direct to the
                            Ministry of Finance and the President”. The Honduran Government was
                            presented a threat of complete stoppage of work on the Inter-American
                            Highway by the Highway contractors, if the consular charge were
                            collected. Rather than place itself in the position of having stopped
                            such construction the Honduran Government agreed with the contractors to
                            waive temporarily collection of the charge. The Embassy informed the
                            Honduran Government informally that the matter would be submitted to the
                            Department of State. The Hondurans stated that a record would be kept of
                            all imports by the contractors, which the Embassy interprets to mean
                            that if eventually the London Bondholders contest the waiving of the 3%
                            consular fee, the Honduran Government will be in a favorable position to
                            make a claim against the contractors. It will be noted that the waiver
                            of collection of the consular charges is entirely on an informal basis,
                            and the contractors could be prosecuted legally in the Honduran courts
                            at any time. Such action may be unlikely, unless the London Bondholders
                            press the matter.</p>
                        <p>It is the Embassy’s belief that it might be advisable to reach a definite
                            agreement on the matter through consultation with the parties concerned
                            as suggested in despatch No. 2624 of February 12, 1943.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department has received your despatch
                            no. 67, May 21, 1943, with reference to the 8% consular charge which the
                            Honduran Government is seeking to collect on equipment and supplies
                            imported for use on the Inter-American Highway.</p>
                        <p>The Department notes that in your despatch no. 2624 of February 12, 1943,
                            and also in your budget report of December 28, 1942<note n="20"
                                xml:id="d323fn20">Economic Trade Report No. 128, not printed.</note>
                            it was stated that the Honduran Government had in October 1942 requested
                            permission of the British Foreign Bondholders Council to <pb n="369"
                                xml:id="pg_369" facs="0383"/>suspend service on the Honduran
                            sterling debt. No categorical statement has, however, been found in your
                            reports that the debt service has in fact been suspended. The Department
                            is of course unaware whether, in the event that the debt service has
                            been suspended, any provision was made with regard to the collection of
                            the 3% portion of the consular charge which was earmarked to service the
                            debt.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the Department is not fully informed regarding the difficulties
                            which the road contractors anticipate in paying the full 8% consular
                            charge. The Embassy’s reports do not explain why the contractors assert
                            that they may be forced to stop construction work unless the consular
                            charge is waived, or their contracts modified.</p>
                        <p>It has already been made clear by Mr. E. W. James’ letter of April 9<note
                                n="21" xml:id="d323fn21">Not printed.</note> that there is no legal
                            objection to the payment of the 3% or indeed the full 8% consular charge
                            for material imported by the contractors for the Inter-American Highway
                            project. With regard to the pioneer highway contractor, it should be
                            pointed out that the only agreement reached with the Honduran Government
                            in regard to the project was that concluded in pursuance of the
                            Department’s telegram no. 137 of June 20, 1942,<note n="21"
                                xml:id="d323fn22">Not printed.</note> which merely secured
                            permission for the contractors with their personnel and equipment freely
                            to enter Honduras. It is not the Department’s view that such a general
                            commitment could require the Honduran Government to waive the collection
                            of fees which the Honduran Government has no legal right to waive, to
                            the prejudice of third parties.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to take this matter up with the contractors and with
                            the appropriate Honduran authorities, bearing the above considerations
                            in mind. You should make it very clear that this Government will not
                            request the Honduran Government to waive any charges which it is legally
                            unable to waive, and that such charges will have to be paid by the
                            respective contractors. You should, on the other hand, be satisfied that
                            the Honduran Government has fulfilled its undertaking to waive such fees
                            as it can waive. In this connection you should remember that the Public
                            Roads Administration is prepared to approve the payment of the full 8%
                            consular charges in the manner described in Mr. James’ letter. Within
                            the limitations described above, any specific agreement which you may be
                            able to reach in Honduras satisfactory to the respective parties to the
                            dispute will receive the Department’s favorable consideration. The
                            Department believes, on the basis of the information available to it,
                            that this should mean in practice the waiving by the Honduran Government
                            of 5% of the 8% consular charge both for the Inter-American Highway <pb
                                n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0384"/>project and for the pioneer
                            highway project;<note n="23" xml:id="d323fn23">For correspondence

                            exist with respect to the Honduran Government and the contractors, it
                            would prefer to see the whole charge paid rather than urge upon the
                            Honduran authorities an exemption which the country’s finances could ill
                            afford.</p>
                        <p>The Department is unwilling to discuss this matter with the
                            representatives of the English bondholders as recommended in the
                            Embassy’s despatch no. 2624 of February 12, 1943, the more so as the
                            Export-Import Bank has a second lien on the portion of the consular
                            charges which are pledged to the service of the sterling debt.</p>

                            Inter-American Highways.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s instruction No. 1322 states, “The Export-Import Bank
                            informs the Department that, quite apart from any interpretation which
                            the Honduran Government may place on its obligations to the British
                            Foreign Bondholders Council, it considers that it has a second lien on
                            the entire three per cent part of the consular charge on which the
                            British Foreign Bondholders Council holds the first lien, and that if
                            there is any surplus available after full service has been provided on
                            Honduran obligations to the Council, this surplus is subject to the
                            Export-Import Bank’s lien.” …<note n="26" xml:id="d324fn26">Omission
                                indicated in the original despatch.</note> “The Department therefore
                            feels that the Honduran Government should not waive the three per cent
                            portion of the consular charge on which the Export-Import Bank has a
                            second lien, quite apart from any obligations which the Honduran
                            Government may have toward the British Foreign Bondholder’s Council in
                            this connection.”</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has discussed the question with the Acting Minister of
                            Finance, Dr. Urbano Quesada, who stated informally that he did <pb
                                n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0385"/>not agree with the
                            Export-Import Bank’s position. He also pointed out that the payment of
                            the 3% charge on imports for the highway would in effect constitute an
                            outright gift by the United States Government to the Honduran Government
                            of two-thirds of the amount of such payment. He outlined again the
                            position forwarded to the Department in the Embassy’s despatch No. 150,
                            and stated that, although technically speaking the 3% could not be
                            waived, there was little likelihood of any complaint from the British

                            respectfully refers to its despatch No. 2624, of February 12, 1943. It
                            will be noted on pages 3 and 4 of the above-mentioned despatch that
                            Article 6 of the Export-Import Bank contract pledges: “(<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) The proceeds of the consular income now
                            pledged in accordance with Legislative Decree No. 66 of March 9, 1926,
                            the same to be available when released from the prior lien of said
                            pledge”. Enclosures Nos. 4 and 5<note n="28" xml:id="d324fn28">Neither
                                printed.</note> to despatch No. 2624 contain Article 8 of Decree No.
                            66 indicating that the proceeds of the 3% charge are to guaranty the
                            payment of the semi-annual bonds of 20,000 pounds sterling each and the
                            expenses for servicing the debt, and that the balance above this amount
                            will be placed at the order of the Honduran Government.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Minister of Finance interprets the above clauses to mean that
                            the Export-Import Bank does not have a lien on the available surplus
                            after service has been provided on Honduran obligations to the Council,
                            and that its lien on receipts up to 20,000 pounds sterling plus service
                            charges does not take effect until “when released from the prior lien of
                            said pledge.” He implied, however, that the Export-Import Bank contract
                            might possibly be construed, after the release from the prior lien, in
                            such a manner that the Export-Import Bank would receive more than 20,000
                            pounds plus service charges.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy would appreciate the receipt of additional instructions
                            indicating the grounds on which the Export-Import Bank claims to have a
                            lien on the present surplus of receipts above the payments for the
                            British debt before presenting the matter formally to the Honduran
                            Government.</p>

                            communications between this Legation and the Department of State:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a list of 16 communications (none printed) of the period
                            May 18 to November 30, 1942, which trace the early development of
                            currency problems in Honduras.]</p>
                        <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0387"/>
                        <p>Because of the fact that this Legation daily receives complaints from
                            business men, bankers, travelers, and from American and Honduran
                            Government officials against what they regard as the shortsighted policy
                            of the United States in discrediting its own currency, it is deemed
                            important to summarize once more the recent developments regarding the
                            dollar currency situation in Honduras.</p>
                        <p>After many years of currency difficulty, Honduras adopted the Lempira
                            standard by Legislative Decree No. 102, of 1926, which states in Article
                            I that the national monetary unit is the Lempira, equal to $0.50 United
                            States currency. This stipulation is renewed in Article I of Legislative
                            Decree No. 114 of 1931.</p>
                        <p>At various times from the early nineteen twenties to the early nineteen
                            thirties, the American dollar was the principal circulating medium in
                            Honduras. Legislative Decree No. 141, of 1934, provided for a commission
                            for the control of exchange and the stabilization of currency in
                            Honduras, and stated in Article 4 that the importation of dollar
                            currency should be limited by the Exchange Control Commission to that
                            amount deemed strictly necessary. In the exercise of powers granted him
                            under Decree No. 141, of March 27, 1934, the President<note n="32"
                                xml:id="d326fn32">Tiburcio Carías Andino.</note> issued an <hi
                                rend="italic">acuerdo</hi> on April 17, 1934, entitled “Reglamento
                            de la Ley de Control de Cambios Internacionales”.</p>
                        <p>Article 20 of the “Reglamento” states that: “Only by special permission
                            of the Commission of Control of Exchange, in each case, may bills of the
                            United States be imported, with the exception of tourists and those who,
                            according to the law of immigration are obliged to bring a certain
                            amount of money fixed-by that law when entering the country, but this
                            money may not be put into circulation except through the credit
                            institutions or any of their branches by obtaining in exchange the legal
                            equivalent in the national (Lempira) currency. The deposits made in
                            conformity with the law of immigration must be returned in the same
                            currency in which they are made, or in international exchange at the
                            current rate if the interested party has to leave the country, but if he
                            remains in territory of the Republic, his repayment will be made in
                            national currency also at its legal equivalent.”</p>
                        <p>Article 21 states: “According as the circulation of bills of the credit
                            institutions established in the country fulfills the necessities of
                            commerce, the Commission of Control of Exchange through the medium of
                            the banks will withdraw the bills of the United States of America from
                            circulation and will proceed to their exportation. Also, the fiduciary
                            currency brought to this country by tourists and immigrants will be
                            exported, and this will be done by the banks of the country, whether it
                            form a part of their assets or should belong to the Exchange Fund”.</p>
                        <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0388"/>
                        <p>At various times the Exchange Control Commission has indicated that
                            dealing in dollar currency was really equivalent to dealing in Foreign
                            exchange, and therefore subject to its direct supervision. Specific
                            instructions were issued to the Banks prohibiting them from selling
                            dollar currency without special authorization, and implying, at least,
                            that the Banks’ purchases of dollar currency were also subject to
                            Commission’s approval.</p>
                        <p>The administration of the above regulations gradually worked to the
                            virtual elimination of dollar currency from daily transactions. However,
                            dollars continued to be accepted by merchants to some extent. The
                            usually unfavorable trade balance of Honduras made it very difficult to
                            obtain foreign exchange, and, there is a charge of two percent plus
                            service fee on all sales of foreign exchange. From about 1938 through
                            1941 there was a premium on dollar currency in the “black market” of 5
                            to 10 percent. Many merchants made buying trips to the United States
                            every other year, carrying with them the dollar currency bought
                            locally.</p>
                        <p>Traditional lack of confidence in the stability of Honduran currency, and
                            fear of revolutions, caused many persons to keep a reserve of dollar
                            currency hidden away.</p>
                        <p>Mention should also be made of the fact that tourists and traveling
                            business men brought American currency into the country. On several
                            occasions, even after the 1934 regulations, the American fruit companies
                            on the North Coast of Honduras were allowed to meet payrolls in U.S.
                            currency.</p>
                        <p>By 1942 the “black market” operations and the other operations referred
                            to above had virtually taken dollar currency out of visible circulation.
                            In fact, dollar currency was so scarce that the “black market” itself
                            virtually ceased to function in 1941. At the same time the balance of
                            trade had become “favorable”, making dollar exchange readily
                            available.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Department’s instructions listed above, the Legation
                            requested that the Honduran Government pass more specific legislation
                            regulating dollar currency. These restrictions are discussed fully in
                            the communications listed in paragraph one of this despatch.</p>
                        <p>Particular mention should be made of the Department’s instruction No.
                            784, of June 27 [<hi rend="italic">25</hi>], 1942,<note n="33"
                                xml:id="d326fn33">Not printed.</note> which states at one point
                            that: “In view of these regulations, you should ask the government to
                            which you are accredited to notify the Central Bank and other
                            institutions not to purchase dollars but merely accept them for
                            transmittal on a collection basis.”</p>
                        <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0389"/>
                        <p>The publication of the Honduran Decrees against dollar currency caused
                            panic in all parts of the country, and to alleviate the situation, the
                            Legation recommended that the Banks accept limited amounts, at least for
                            collection purposes, and mildly censured the Banco Atlántida, an
                            American-owned firm, for having refused to take dollars in any form at
                            some of its branches.</p>
                        <p>The Banco Atlántida followed a policy of accepting only small amounts of
                            U. S. currency, and, as reported in despatch No. 2456, of November 19,
                                1942,<note n="34" xml:id="d326fn34">Not printed.</note> it attempted
                            to send $160,000 to the United States after first notifying this
                            Legation, as mentioned in the Legation’s despatch No. 2415 of October
                            30, 1942.<note n="34" xml:id="d326fn35">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>When Mr. Jean Charbonnet, General Manager of the Banco Atlántida, arrived
                            in Miami it is reported here that he was virtually arrested and taken to
                            Atlanta, Georgia, along with the funds to be turned over to the Federal
                            Reserve Bank. It is believed that he has now been released, but the
                            ultimate disposition of the funds remains in question.</p>
                        <p>The Banco de Honduras reports that its attempts to ship currency to the
                            United States have only caused trouble and monetary loss; therefore, it
                            has suspended accepting dollar currency under any circumstances
                            whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>The Banco Atlántida has not complained about the Charbonnet incident, but
                            merely informed the Honduran Government, and this Legation, that,
                            because of its present involvement with American currency, in future it
                            would accept American dollars for collection only, and that all charges
                            plus one percent would be deducted from the amount due to the person
                            presenting the currency. Both banks are reportedly ignoring the Exchange
                            Control Commission’s authorizations to pay in Lempiras for U.S. currency
                            regardless of whether the source be travelers, officials, etc. This is
                            working a hardship on persons, many of them American citizens, who
                            arrive here with $50 in U. S. currency under the impression that they
                            can exchange them for Lempiras through the Exchange Control
                            Commission.</p>
                        <p>The President of the Honduran National Congress, Plutarco Muñoz,
                            according to unofficial information, planned to discuss the situation
                            extensively in his speech at the opening session of the National
                            Congress, December 5, 1942. After much discussion, and at the request of
                            President Carías, he modified his opening speech, and has confined
                            himself to newspaper comments. His comments are echoed throughout the
                            Republic; some trying to clarify the policy of the United States by
                            pointing out that despite the billions being expended by the United
                            States, the U. S. currency is really not falling <pb n="376"
                                xml:id="pg_376" facs="0390"/>in value, while others are not so
                            hopeful. Some critics point out that the Lempira is tied to the dollar
                            and eventually will decline also.</p>
                        <p>There is an undercurrent of glee on the part of anti-Americans, and
                            pro-Axis persons, and comments regarding the “bungling policy of the
                            Democracies” and the “prophetic weakness of the dollar” are not
                            infrequent.</p>
                        <p>There is not, and never has been, as far as the Legation has been able to
                            ascertain by diligent inquiry, any Axis-owned U. S. currency in
                            Honduras.</p>
                        <p>The Honduran public, along with the Honduran Government, is frankly
                            puzzled by what it considers a policy being urged on the Honduran
                            Government to discredit and question the stability of United States
                            currency. Pointing out that there is a difference between depreciating
                            the currency and depreciating the exchange rates, has had little
                            beneficial effect. Letters from persons in various parts of the interior
                            who believe they have now lost their meager savings, and complaints from
                            disgruntled travelers, continue to beset the Legation and the
                            consulates.</p>
                        <p>The Legation clearly understands that substantial amounts of American
                            currency were seized when the Germans over-ran Norway, the Netherlands,
                            Belgium, France, et cetera, and that the object of restricting the
                            movement of dollar currency in Latin America is to prevent the enemy
                            from benefiting from the sums seized. According to the “United States
                            Treasury Circulation Statement”, the amount of money in circulation
                            outside the Treasury on June 30, 1940, was $7,847,501,324. It seems
                            improbable that more than 1 percent (or $78,475,013) could have been in
                            the countries over-run by the Germans, and it is even more unlikely that
                            the Germans could have seized all of this; certainly a substantial
                            proportion must have been sent away prior to their arrival. Furthermore,
                            much (perhaps most) of what the Germans seized must have been exchanged
                            by now.</p>
                        <p>It is extremely difficult to understand (1) how substantial sums of
                            “tainted” dollar currency could be brought into Honduras, (2) how it
                            could be changed into Lempiras on a large scale without attracting
                            attention; in fact, without upsetting the whole national currency
                            system, and (3) since all exchange transactions are rigidly controlled
                            by the Honduran Government, and all such transactions are made through
                            the medium of U. S. banks, what good it would do the Axis to get its
                            funds changed from dollars into Lempiras in the first instance.</p>
                        <p>While the depreciation of dollar currency and the controls of the
                            movement of dollar currency have undoubtedly handicapped Axis operations
                            in certain areas, the damage to American prestige and the <pb n="377"
                                xml:id="pg_377" facs="0391"/>inconvenience to the Latin-American
                            public weigh heavily on the other side of the scales.</p>
                        <p>Unless corrective measures are taken, the situation is likely to become
                            worse. Any information which the Department may have regarding the
                            modification or clarification of the policy, or regarding the length of
                            time the Honduran and the traveling public must endure these unqualified
                            hardships, will be sincerely appreciated. In any case, the United States
                            Treasury should make adequate arrangements enabling Latin American
                            banking entities to make legitimate shipments of U.S. currency to the
                            United States in an orderly manner.</p>

                            of the situation which has occasioned your various communications
                            regarding the effects of this Government’s program and the Honduran
                            controls with respect to dollar currency and it is hoped that this
                            airgram will assist in solving these difficulties.</p>
                        <p>In instituting controls over the movement of dollar currency, it was not
                            the intention of this Government to interfere with the legitimate
                            movement of dollar currency within the other American republics or the
                            legitimate importation of dollar currency into the United States from
                            the other American republics. Nevertheless, it was known that the Axis
                            had seized large amounts of dollar currency, and that this currency was
                            being disposed of in part through channels involving persons in the
                            neutral countries of Europe and in the other American republics. It was
                            believed that the best way to prevent the Axis from realizing on their
                            looted currency was to adopt measures designed to drive the value of the
                            dollar bill as low as possible in those markets where the dollar was not
                            a part of the circulating medium. It was not intended to affect the
                            exchange rate for telegraphic transfers, dollar drafts, travelers
                            checks, et cetera, in those areas and events have proved that our
                            currency controls did not affect such rate. Neither was it intended to
                            affect the rate of exchange for dollar currency in those areas such as
                            exist in Central America and in Cuba where dollar currency is a
                            substantial part of the circulating <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378"
                                facs="0392"/>medium and thus far we have had no indication from any
                            of these areas that such rate has been affected.</p>
                        <p>Consistent with the foregoing aims, it was believed that two alternative
                            types of currency controls should be suggested to the governments of the
                            other American republics in order to supplement our own controls. For
                            those areas where dollar currency was not a part of the circulating
                            medium, it was believed that the controls should include: (1) a
                            prohibition against the importation and exportation of dollar currency
                            except direct currency movements between the United States and the area
                            involved through the medium of authorized banking institutions and
                            except for a reasonable exemption for travelers between the United
                            States and that area; (2) the requirement that all dollar currency be
                            deposited with authorized banking institutions for forwarding to the
                            United States on a collection basis; and (3) the prohibition of all
                            further holding of or dealing in dollar currency within the area
                            involved. For those areas where the dollar was a substantial part of the
                            circulating medium, it was recognized that items (2) and (3) would not
                            be feasible and consequently only item (1) was suggested to those areas
                            as the type of control desired.</p>
                        <p>It was first assumed that Honduras was an area where the dollar was a
                            substantial part of the circulating medium and accordingly a telegram
                            suggesting controls along the above-mentioned lines was drafted. Prior
                            to the dispatching of this telegram, however, the Legation’s despatch
                            no. 2067, May 23,<note n="37" xml:id="d327fn37">Not printed.</note> was
                            received. In this despatch it was stated that “The circulation of United
                            States currency in Honduras is forbidden by law”. As a result of this
                            statement, the Department concluded that Honduras was an area in which
                            dollar currency was not a substantial part of the circulating medium and
                            the statement “In view of these regulations, you should ask the
                            government to which you are accredited to notify the Central Bank and
                            other institutions not to purchase dollars but merely to accept them for
                            transmittal on a collection basis” was accordingly included in
                            instruction no. 784, June 25, 1942.<note n="37" xml:id="d327fn38">Not
                                printed.</note> This suggestion, of course, did not apply to the
                            amounts of dollar currency brought in by travelers within the limits of
                            the Honduran travelers’ exemption which it was contemplated would be
                            purchased outright by the banks.</p>
                        <p>It now appears that the Department’s conclusion was incorrect and that,
                            in point of fact, dollar currency does circulate to some extent in
                            Honduras. Apparently the precise situation is that the selling of dollar
                            currency by banking institutions in Honduras is prohibited without
                            special authorization but the purchase is not. The purpose of the
                            Honduran controls which were put into existence in 1934 appears to be to
                            encourage the purchase of dollar currency by banking institutions <pb
                                n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0393"/>so as to withdraw such currency
                            from circulation (Article 21, Decree No. 141 of 1934, cited in despatch
                            2500).</p>
                        <p>In order to alleviate the existing situation, it is suggested that you
                            inform the Honduran authorities that this Government believes that our
                            controls would be sufficiently implemented if the Honduran Government
                            merely prohibited the importation and exportation of dollar currency
                            except for direct currency movements between Honduras and the United
                            States through the medium of authorized banking institutions (which we
                            assume would be the Banco Atlántida and the Banco de Honduras) and
                            except for a $50 exemption for travelers between the United States and
                            Honduras. Currency, in excess of the $50 exemption which persons
                            entering or leaving Honduras attempt to import or export, should be
                            taken from such persons and forwarded to the United States on a
                            collection basis for the account of the persons involved. The effective
                            enforcement of such a provision would make it unnecessary from our point
                            of view to restrict the circulation of dollar currency within Honduras.
                            In this latter connection it might be advisable, however, for
                            arrangements to be made so that deposits of bills of large denomination
                            such as $500 or over (and possibly $100 or over if you believe this
                            would not have adverse repercussions) or deposits of large sums would be
                            accepted for forwarding to the United States on a collection basis only
                            for the account of the individual depositor. It is suggested that such
                            arrangements might be more appropriately made informally with the banks
                            rather than through a formal decree or regulation of the Honduran
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Upon the basis of the above outlined controls the Treasury will
                            automatically release for free use in the United States all dollar
                            currency forwarded by the Banco Atlántida or the Banco de Honduras for
                            its own account. Such currency should be forwarded by these banks in
                            packages clearly marked “securities” and addressed to the Federal
                            Reserve Bank of New York. Treasury will make the necessary arrangements
                            with the customs authorities to permit such packages to proceed to their
                            destination without delay. Should such packages be brought to the United
                            States by individuals, arrangements should be made so that such
                            individuals will turn the packages over to the customs authorities for
                            forwarding to the Federal Reserve Bank and, upon being notified by the
                            Legation sufficiently in advance, the Department will make arrangements
                            through the Treasury so that such individuals will have no difficulty
                            with customs concerning such packages. In this connection it is
                            regretted that, due to an inadvertence, customs authorities were not
                            notified prior to the arrival in Miami of Mr. Jean Charbonnet, General
                            Manager of the Banco Atlántida on November 19, 1942. The Legation may
                            wish to express this Government’s regret to Mr. Charbonnet and to inform
                                <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0394"/>the Banco Atlántida that
                            the $160,000 in currency taken from him has been released.</p>
                        <p>Currency forwarded on a collection basis for the account of individuals
                            in the aforementioned cases of imports or exports exceeding $50 and
                            deposits of large bills or large sums should be forwarded in separate
                            packages and should be accompanied by a statement that such currency is
                            not being forwarded for the account of the forwarding bank.</p>
                        <p>In discussing these matters with the Honduran authorities, the Legation
                            may wish to keep in mind that the Honduran Government may not wish to
                            relax its controls to the point indicated above but may of its own
                            accord desire to proceed with its program to eliminate dollar currency
                            as a circulating medium in Honduras. Should this be the case, it is not
                            believed that the Legation should oppose this policy, as it is within
                            the competence of any sovereign government to eliminate a foreign
                            currency from its market if it so desires. In such event, however, the
                            Legation should inform the Banco Atlántida and the Banco de Honduras
                            that any dollar currency purchased by it under license from the Honduran
                            Exchange Control Commission will automatically be released by the
                            Treasury upon arrival in the United States if accompanied by an
                            appropriate statement by the bank concerned to the effect that it was
                            acquired pursuant to authorization from the Exchange Control
                            Commission.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that, after you have worked this matter out with the
                            Honduran authorities, you arrange with those authorities for appropriate
                            publicity. If possible, please telegraph the text of any public
                            statement before it is issued so that the Department may, if it is felt
                            desirable, make suggestions or comments thereon.</p>
                        <p>It is hoped that this airgram will enable you satisfactorily to settle
                            the matter. If you have any further questions or problems, please inform
                            the Department promptly. Please also keep the Department informed of all
                            developments.</p>

                        <p>The Legation suggested in its telegram No. 20 the substitution of United
                            States two dollar bills for the present currency of the United States
                            now in Honduras with the following points in mind: (1) that Honduras
                            would change its laws regulating the circulation of U.S. currency in
                            Honduras, (2) that the U. S. Treasury Department believed that there was
                            a probability that some Axis tainted currency existed in Honduras, and
                            (3) that by allowing dollar currency to circulate in Honduras, and not
                            forcing the dollar currency into the banks to be exchanged for Lempiras,
                            the pressure on the limited amount of Lempiras now available might be
                            relieved to the extent of the amount of U. S. currency remaining in
                            Honduras.</p>
                        <p>In Paragraph Three of the Department’s telegram No. 27, it is stated: “If
                            the existing Honduran controls are modified, it would appear that the
                            dollar currency presently in Honduras would circulate freely, that the
                            shortage of Lempiras would be relieved and that the substitution of two
                            dollar bills would not be necessary.” It is entirely true that if
                            Honduras declared U.S. currency legal tender again, as it did in the
                            1920’s, that U.S. currency would circulate freely; however, this would
                            seem to indicate that the Treasury Department now has no fear of Axis
                            tainted currency already in Honduras, which is also this Legation’s
                            belief. “That the shortage of Lempiras would be relieved”, of course,
                            merely means to the extent that dollar currency would not be forced into
                            the banks to be exchanged for Lempiras.</p>
                        <p>In Paragraph Five of the Department’s telegram No. 27 it is stated: “The
                            Department does not understand the relevancy to the question of currency
                            controls of the last paragraph of your telegram concerning the
                            impossibility of selling dollar drafts to the banks in Honduras”.…<note
                                n="40" xml:id="d328fn40">Omission indicated in the original
                                despatch.</note> “It would seem that this situation may arise
                            irrespective of whether dollar currency circulates freely in
                            Honduras.”</p>
                        <p>When a Honduran bank buys dollar drafts, it may pay for these drafts in
                            one of two ways: (1) in local currency, (2) in foreign currency obtained
                            by selling some of its stocks, bonds, etc., already held abroad. Payment
                            in foreign currency is limited to the extent that the owners of the
                            exchange are willing to take the foreign currency. However, the bulk of
                            the foreign exchange purchased by Honduran banks is purchased from
                            persons who want Lempiras. For example: the United Fruit Company, the
                            Standard Fruit Company, the New York and Honduras Rosario Mining
                            Company, the Compañía Minera Agua Fría, the United States contractors
                            working on the Inter-American Highway, the various projects of the
                            Coordinator’s Office and the Board of Economic Warfare, etc., all want
                            Lempiras to meet local payrolls and make local purchases. They can
                            obtain Lempiras only by selling dollar drafts. They sell the dollar
                            drafts to the banks. In <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0396"/>normal
                            times, the banks could resell the dollar drafts to importers. With the
                            present shipping difficulties, the importers cannot get normal amounts
                            of merchandise from the United States and other countries, therefore,
                            they do not need as much foreign exchange. The foreign exchange balances
                            of the banks increase while their supplies of Lempiras decrease. The
                            supply of Lempiras is limited. If the United States requests the
                            Honduran Government to have all U.S. currency forwarded to the United
                            States, the banks must purchase such dollar currency with Lempiras.
                            During the last seven months the banks have purchased over $250,000 in
                            U.S. currency, which means that the amount of available Lempiras in the
                            banks which might have been used for the purchase of foreign exchange or
                            for ordinary banking operations has been decreased by more than 500,000
                            Lempiras. This is roughly 4% of the entire monetary medium of the
                            country, including legal reserves of the banks which must be held in
                            silver Lempiras. It is quite evident from this explanation that currency
                            controls have considerable relevance to the difficulties of the banks in
                            purchases of dollar drafts.<note n="*" xml:id="d328fn40a">A more
                                complete discussion is contained in the Legation’s report No. 152,
                                of January 18, 1943, entitled “Balance of International Payments,
                                Exchange Control and Monetary Control.” [Footnote in the original;
                                report not printed.]</note></p>
                        <p>Of course, the Legation and the various banking and Government officials
                            with whom the question was originally discussed did not think that such
                            a relatively large amount of U.S. currency existed in the country. This
                            was due to the fact that most of it was being hoarded, since many people
                            considered the U. S. dollar as the equivalent of, or even better than,
                            gold. At the same time it was not thought necessary to apply any further
                            internal restrictions on the U. S. dollar, because of the complete lack
                            of any evidence that there were any counterfeit dollars or Axis tainted
                            dollars in Honduras.</p>
                        <p>The effect of forcing down the value of dollar currency and discrediting
                            dollar currency in Honduras, where there has been no evidence that there
                            was in existence any currency of Axis taint, has been most
                            unfortunate.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, the Legation respectfully requests that the
                            Department forward to the Legation the text of whatever modifications of
                            present controls the Department considers should be suggested to the
                            Honduran Government.</p>

                                understanding that its principal object would be to render a
                                decision on the advisability of founding a National Bank or such
                                other bank as it might consider to be most suitable, and on the
                                further understanding that the resultant recommendations would not
                                necessarily lead to any decision or action by the Honduran
                                Government.</note></p>
                        <p>It is the intention of the Treasury Department to include in the
                            personnel of the mission experts from other agencies of this Government.
                            The Treasury Department states that while the members of the mission can
                            be selected in the near future and preparatory work done in this
                            country, it will not be possible for the mission to leave promptly for
                            Honduras because the duties of several members of the mission will
                            require their presence in Washington for the next two months. It would
                            appear, however, that the mission will be able to arrange to leave for
                            Honduras in April or May.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State refers to the Legation’s despatch no. 2619 of
                            February 11, 1943 concerning currency difficulties in Honduras in which
                            the Legation requests that the Department forward the text of whatever
                            modifications of present controls the Department considers should be
                            suggested to the Honduran Government.</p>
                        <p>At the outset the Department wishes to point out that neither it nor the
                            Treasury has ever believed that there was a probability that any
                            appreciable amount of Axis-tainted currency existed in Honduras. The
                            suggestions originally contained in the Department’s instruction no.
                            784, June 25, 1942,<note n="41" xml:id="d330fn41">Not printed.</note>
                            were, as the Legation knows, <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0398"
                            />predicated upon the assumption that dollar currency was not a part of
                            the circulating medium in Honduras. Because of this fact, it was felt
                            that a requirement that all dollar currency be deposited and a
                            prohibition against the further holding of dollar currency in Honduras
                            would have constituted an effective means of uncovering such
                            Axis-tainted currency as might in the future have found its way into
                            Honduras in violation of the import restrictions.</p>
                        <p>The Legation’s clarification of the relationship between the difficulties
                            which might be encountered in the future in connection with the sale of
                            dollar drafts and the currency controls is appreciated.</p>
                        <p>Since the Department does not have available to it a complete compilation
                            of the Honduran exchange control laws, it is difficult to suggest the
                            text of any request for modifications that should be made to the
                            Honduran Government. However, it is believed that the following points
                            will enable the Legation to proceed, in such manner as it sees fit, with
                            the necessary discussions with the Honduran authorities: <list>

                                <item>It should be suggested to the Honduran Government that it
                                    withdraw the following instructions: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                                    such instructions against the sale or purchase of dollar
                                    currency by banks from persons within Honduras as may have been
                                    issued under Decree No. 141 of 1934 (see the Legation’s despatch

                                    the Legation’s attention is invited to the remarks contained in
                                    the latter part of the Department’s A–164, January 14, 1943,
                                    concerning the possible desire of the Honduran Government to
                                    eliminate dollar currency as part of the circulating
                                    medium.</item>

                                <item>It is believed that the restrictions contained in Decree No.
                                    48 of July 15, 1942 (see the Legation’s despatch no. 2206, July
                                    16, 1942<note n="46" xml:id="d330fn44">Not printed.</note>) and
                                    in Decree No. 141 of 1934 constitute, if effectively enforced, a
                                    sufficient prohibition against the importation and exportation
                                    of dollar currency.</item>

                                <item>As a result of the foregoing, it is believed that the
                                    objective of free circulation of dollar currency within Honduras
                                    and the prohibition of the importation and exportation of such
                                    currency (with the exception of a $50 travelers exemption) will
                                    be achieved.</item>

                                <item>To provide a check against the possible appearance of
                                    Axis-tainted currency in Honduras, it is suggested that the
                                    Legation make arrangements informally with the Banco Atlántida
                                    and the Banco de Honduras to handle deposits within Honduras of
                                    dollar currency of large denominations and of large sums of
                                    dollar currency in the manner outlined in the Department’s
                                    A–164, January 14, 1943.</item>
                                <label>(5)</label>
                                <item>The Legation’s attention is again invited to the fact that the
                                    Banco Atlántida and the Banco de Honduras need not necessarily
                                    forward <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0399"/>to the United
                                    States for their own accounts dollar currency which they
                                    purchase (see Department’s telegram 27, January 26, 1943<note
                                        n="47" xml:id="d330fn45">Not printed.</note>). They may, if
                                    they wish, retain such currency and if the Honduran restrictions
                                    are withdrawn, sell it to persons within Honduras. Furthermore,
                                    should the banks require additional dollar currency to satisfy
                                    the currency needs of Honduras, they can make withdrawals from
                                    their accounts in the United States in the form of dollar
                                    currency and, with the permission of the Honduran authorities,
                                    import such currency into Honduras.</item>

                        <p>The Legation is requested to inform the Department of any questions it
                            may have concerning the matters discussed in this instruction and to
                            keep the Department informed of all developments. The Legation is also

                        <p>86. Your 75, March 22. This Government has no objection to the use of
                            United States silver coins for internal circulation in Honduras and will
                            cooperate in making such coins available. In view of the urgency of the
                            matter, however, we wonder whether it would not be a better procedure
                            for the Honduran banks to utilize gold to replace some of the lempira
                            coins now held as reserves behind their deposits, under Article 18 of
                            Decree No. 80 of March 11, 1937. Apparently, this would release more
                            than 1,000,000 lempiras for actual circulation without violating any
                            requirement of Honduran law. With this purpose in mind, could not the
                            Exchange Control and Monetary Stabilization Commission sell to one or
                            both of the banks the gold which it now has in custody deposit with
                            them, totaling $108,915? It appears that this would release 217,830
                            lempiras for circulation purposes.</p>
                        <p>To supplement this, might it be possible for gold to be purchased and
                            placed on earmark at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and counted as
                            part of the reserve against lempira deposits.</p>
                        <p>As a third possibility it might be suggested that, if immediate receipt
                            of gold is required, perhaps the Honduran Government or the Exchange
                            Control Commission could purchase the gold in New York from the United
                            States Government or in Mexico City, arrange for <pb n="387"
                                xml:id="pg_387" facs="0401"/>shipment to Tegucigalpa, and
                            subsequently allocate the gold to the banks.</p>
                        <p>Will regulations permit or can they be amended to permit the banks to
                            hold gold as reserve for notes issued? If so, perhaps a further quantity
                            of silver lempiras could be released for circulation.</p>
                        <p>Pending a decision on the question of utilizing gold, the United States
                            Government will make preliminary arrangements for the shipment of silver
                            coins which will be held in abeyance until the wishes of the Honduran
                            Government are determined.</p>

                        <p>88. From Treasury. Your 80, March 30, 4 p.m. Apparently you did not
                            understand the suggestion in the Department’s 86.<note n="54"

                                386</ref>.</note> The use of gold to satisfy reserve requirements
                            was not intended to reduce the effective cash reserves of the banks.
                            Lempira silver coins held as legal reserves are not effective reserves
                            for meeting the public demands for cash. Under Honduran law it appears
                            that gold would serve fully as well as silver lempiras for reserves
                            against bank deposits. Apparently 2 or 3 million lempiras in coins are
                            now immobilized as reserves in the banks. If gold were utilized to
                            fulfill the deposit reserve requirement, a large number of these silver
                            lempiras would become effective cash available for active circulation in
                            Honduras and would no longer be immobilized in the banks. An existing
                            reserve deficiency would apparently be remedied by a similar acquisition
                            of gold.</p>
                        <p>However, in view of your statement that the situation is extremely
                            critical, the silver 50-cent pieces are being made available in New York

                            Acting Minister of Finance from Tegucigalpa, no appointments were
                            arranged for May 31, and the Mission spent the afternoon in discussion
                            with members of the Embassy staff. On the morning of June 1, the
                            Mission, accompanied by Mr. Coello, of the Foreign Office, and Messrs.
                                Faust<note n="60" xml:id="d338fn60">John B. Faust, Second Secretary
                                of Embassy and Consul.</note> and Whedbee <pb n="390"
                                xml:id="pg_390" facs="0404"/>of the Embassy, called on President
                            Carías, Foreign Minister Dr. Salvador Aguirre, and Acting Minister of
                            Finance Dr. Urbano Quesada. The Mission was received quite cordially,
                            and Dr. Quesada offered the full cooperation of his Ministry in
                            furnishing any information which the Mission desired.</p>
                        <p>The Mission spent the next week interviewing important Honduran
                            Government officials, bankers, merchants, agriculturalists, and the
                            directors of the various United States’ Government activities in
                            Honduras. Most of the second week of the Mission’s stay in Honduras was
                            spent at important cities on the north coast of Honduras interviewing
                            important persons in that area. Mr. Bernstein returned to the United
                            States on June 11, and Mr. Esgate on June 16. Mr. Triffen and Mr. De
                            Beers remained in Honduras until July 2, during which time they
                            interviewed various officials and made a trip to Choluteca.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that the Mission took detailed notes of their various
                            interviews, which are presumably available to the Department and
                            therefore it appears unnecessary to review them at this time.</p>
                        <p>The Mission had not reached any definite conclusions as to what its
                            recommendations would be when the members left Honduras. They indicated
                            to the Embassy and to various Honduran officials however, that they were
                            particularly interested in the question of the possible formation of a
                            Central Bank, whose functions might be: (1) the control of foreign
                            exchange, (2) the issuance and regulation of currency, (3) the
                            supervision of private banks, (4) a repository of Government funds, (5)
                            the repository of private bank reserves, (6) the discounting of bills,
                            and perhaps (7) a source of loans to the Honduran Government. The
                            Central Bank might also have a separate section devoted to agricultural
                            credit, which would be subsidized from the present Governmental revenues
                            for the Exchange Fund and the Cumulative Fund.</p>
                        <p>Members of the Mission planned to stop in Nicaragua and El Salvador
                            briefly before returning to the United States in order to talk to
                            officials connected with Governmental banking enterprises in those
                            countries.</p>

                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>A saving of the costs of bringing into the country additional

                            </list></p>
                        <p>A country which wishes to follow a policy of exchange stability must
                            provide the monetary authorities with some means of buying the
                            accumulating quantity of foreign exchange in those periods in which the
                            international balance of payments is favorable. The lack of such a
                            provision in the Honduran monetary system not only causes difficulty at
                            present, under war-time conditions, but also will involve inconveniences
                            in the future, for in the normal course of its development a country
                            must provide for a growth in its exchange balances as well as an
                            increase in its domestic circulation requirements. This preliminary
                            report provides no permanent solution for the problem, but it does try
                            to obtain the same effect now by other devices and to <pb n="392"

                        <p>The Mission recommends as a temporary measure that the lempira coins now
                            immobilized in the banks’ vaults as required reserves behind notes and
                            deposits be progressively released for circulation, if and as the need
                            arises; and that they be replaced in the banks’ reserves by equivalent
                            amounts of foreign exchange, deposited in special custody accounts,
                            under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance and, if deemed
                            advisable, of the Exchange Control Commission.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>In order that Honduras may be able to deal effectively with possible
                            exchange shortages in the future, the foreign exchange reserves of the
                            country should be concentrated in the Exchange Control Commission and in
                            the banks, rather than dissipated in the hands of the public in the form
                            of foreign coins and notes, which might be hoarded in times of an
                            exchange crisis, i.e., precisely at the moment when they would be most
                            needed by the authorities. The recommendation presented in this
                            preliminary report would seek to maintain a high degree of concentration
                            of these reserves.</p>

                        <p>While this proposal of the Mission aims primarily at the solution of the
                            present shortage of lempiras, it constitutes also a step in the
                            direction of further reforms aiming at the modernization of the monetary
                            institutions of Honduras.</p>

                        <p>To supplement the foregoing measures the Mission suggests that action be
                            taken to reduce the demand for coins and banknotes in Honduras, by
                            requesting the principal employers of the country (1) to distribute
                            their payroll dates so that too many do not fall at the end or the
                            middle of the month, and (2) to make more frequent payment of wages and
                            salaries. The Government, as one of the largest employers, should of
                            course take the lead in these changes.</p>

                        <p>The measures proposed here are expected to take care of the Honduran
                            currency needs for the next half-year or more, by which time some new
                            procedures may be available to deal with the problem. Nevertheless,
                            other expedients may have to be utilized, if the difficulties continue.
                            It is not too early to consider the various possible measures available
                            to the Honduran Government, even though further action may not be
                            required for some time. In this connection the Mission <pb n="393"

                        <p>The Embassy urgently requests that the Treasury Department and other
                            interested agencies be informed that further United States currency is
                            needed by Honduras, and that appropriate steps be taken to facilitate
                            the shipment of such currency.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State refers to the Embassy’s despatch no. 204 dated

                            previous correspondence concerning the circulation of United States
                            currency in Honduras.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy, of course, is aware that considerable sums of fifty and ten
                            cent pieces have been sent to Honduras from the United <pb n="394"
                                xml:id="pg_394" facs="0408"/>States in order to relieve the shortage
                            in Honduras of United States currency in circulation. The Treasury
                            Department has informed the Department that it is now in receipt of an
                            application filed by the Whitney National Bank of New Orleans,
                            Louisiana, on behalf of the Banco de Honduras, Tegucigalpa, for a
                            license to permit the release of approximately $500,000 in fifty cent
                            and ten cent pieces which the Banco de Honduras contemplates sending to
                            the United States. According to the Treasury Department, this
                            application states that the termination of one of the contractor’s
                            projects makes it no longer necessary for this sum to remain in
                            circulation.</p>
                        <p>This appears to be the first indication of the return to the United
                            States of part of the sums of coins which were sent to Honduras. The
                            Embassy is requested to investigate and report, including an expression
                            of its views, concerning this matter, as well as the adequacy of the
                            present amount of United States currency in circulation.</p>

                            which it is claimed the Banco de Honduras contemplates sending to the

                        <p>In any event, it is not believed advisable to export any substantial
                            amount of United States currency from Honduras at this time. Although it
                            is true that the work of the United States Army Engineers on the
                            Pan-American Highway in Honduras has been terminated, this work is being
                            carried on at a reduced pace by the United States Public Roads
                            Administration which it is believed will employ a substantial number of
                            men even though not in the numbers heretofore employed by the United
                            States Army Engineers and contractors.<note n="66" xml:id="d343fn66">For

                            will be promptly reported. For the present, it is recommended that
                            action on the application be deferred. It would be unfortunate if
                            substantial amounts of United States currency were exported from
                            Honduras to the United States and then work on United States projects
                            resulted in substantial employment necessitating the return of such

                        <p>The Embassy of Mexico presents its compliments to the Department of State
                            and has to refer to recent conversations between its representatives
                            with officials of the War Department and of National Selective Service
                            Headquarters, with a view to providing a practical procedure whereby the
                            Government of the United States shall furnish to the Government of
                            Mexico the information required under Paragraph VI of the Reciprocal
                            Agreement of January 23 [<hi rend="italic">22</hi>], 1943.</p>
                        <p>As until now it has been impossible to solve the difficulties to be met
                            by the United States military authorities in furnishing this information
                            with respect to Mexican nationals already serving in the armed forces of
                            the United States of America, the Embassy is of the opinion that it is
                            absolutely necessary to agree upon a system whereby the Government of
                            Mexico shall be able to communicate immediately with those of its
                            nationals who, although registered under Selective Service, have not yet
                            been incorporated into the United States Army. In this way, while there
                            is being sought a way to furnish the Government of Mexico the most ample
                            information possible regarding those of its nationals already in the
                            ranks of the Army of the United States, at least it would be possible to
                            prevent the daily further increase of those difficulties which are being
                            caused by the lack of data with respect to these Mexicans.</p>
                        <p>With this in view, the Embassy of Mexico requests that the name of its
                            country be included in the list of cobelligerent nations constituting
                            Paragraph 10 of Memorandum No. 129<note n="6" xml:id="d349fn6">Concerned

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sumner</hi>: The other day while Padilla<note
                                n="7" xml:id="d350fn7">Ezequiel Padilla, Mexican Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs.</note> and I were discussing some major factors in
                            our relationships and particularly with respect to the situation in
                            Mexico, he referred to a conversation which he had with you either in
                            Monterrey or Corpus Christi with respect to the possible participation
                            of elements of the Mexican armed forces in the conflict. Padilla said
                            that he felt more and more that it was desirable for some elements of
                            the Mexican armed forces to participate in the actual conflict. He said
                            that the situation within the country was on the whole developing
                            satisfactorily but that naturally Mexico was further away from the war
                            and that it was difficult for the great masses of the people to
                            appreciate all of the implications of the war for Mexico and Mexico’s
                            responsibility. This was even more so now that the probability of attack
                            on this continent was more remote. He said that during the last weeks
                            increasingly high ranking officials of the Mexican army had spoken to
                            him about what they considered the real importance and interest of
                            elements of the Mexican armed forces taking part in the conflict. They
                            all realized the practical difficulties in the way but they felt, as
                            military men, that it was not in accord with Mexico’s dignity and her
                            place among the United Nations that her army did not bear a part of the
                            sacrifices of the war. He said it was very interesting that these
                            officers were very outspoken and definite in their opinion and he was
                            sure that the President shared their opinion. He said that a good many
                            of the high ranking officers felt chagrined that General Cárdenas<note
                                n="8" xml:id="d350fn8">Gen. Lázaro Cárdenas, Mexican Minister for
                                Defense.</note> should have made a statement some time ago that
                            Mexico could not take any actual part in the armed conflict because her
                            men had nothing to fight with and they resented his statement.</p>
                        <p>Padilla said that the thing which preoccupied him was that the United
                            Nations, or at least most of them, were making so many sacrifices in the
                            way of blood and treasure and that these would undoubtedly increase
                            before the end of the war came. He considered it very probable that
                            there would have to be a land invasion of Europe before the end of the
                            war and that this would involve very heavy sacrifices in blood. He could
                            understand that there would be quite an internal reaction among the
                            people of the United States to the effect that some of the other
                            American Republics had not done their share in the way of actual
                            sacrifice. He personally, and he was sure the President, felt the way
                            some of these high military officers felt, that <pb n="405"
                                xml:id="pg_405" facs="0419"/>it would be a very good thing all
                            around if there could be some participation by Mexican elements in the
                            actual conflict. He did not know how this could be done but he thought
                            it would be desirable to explore the situation.</p>
                        <p>I told him that there were many difficulties in the way of having
                            elements from the armed forces of the other American Republics
                            participating in the conflict. These, I was sure, were familiar to him.
                            Among these was the question of transport, organization and command. I
                            agreed with him, I said, that it would be desirable to have such
                            elements participate in the conflict, particularly from Mexico and
                            Brazil. As I saw it, however, it would be exceedingly difficult to
                            arrange for the present for elements of the army to participate—although
                            this also was a subject which should receive consideration. In my
                            opinion the most practical way would be to have Mexican pilots as a
                            Mexican escadrille participate at the front. I saw few fundamental
                            difficulties in the way of this, for the Mexican army now had a
                            considerable number of trained pilots and all they needed was a little
                            further final training before being able to fly combat ships. I said
                            that I thought the idea of a Mexican flying unit was one which could be
                            considered, but of course I was not able to pass any final word on
                            this.</p>
                        <p>Padilla said that he thought it would be a splendid thing if arrangements
                            could be made for a Mexican and Brazilian flying unit to participate in
                            actual combat in aerial warfare at some of the fronts. He thought this
                            was an entirely practicable and feasible idea and it would be a fine
                            entering wedge. It was something which could be arranged with small
                            delay and was entirely practical from practically every point of view.
                            He thought that it could easily be confined at the outset to a Mexican
                            and Brazilian unit. He said that he would be very glad if I would
                            explore this idea with you entirely informally for the present and he
                            asked me when doing so to refer to the conversation which he had had
                            with you in this respect during the exchange of visits between the two
                            Presidents.</p>
                        <p>My own feeling is that it would be desirable to do something along these
                            lines, and as I think the question of army units is impracticable still,
                            it would be desirable to do something from the point of view of an air
                            unit. Our Army and Navy officials recognize the fact that the Mexican
                            pilots are excellent. All they need is a little extra training. There
                            would seem to be no fundamental difficulty in having a Mexican and
                            Brazilian air unit participate on the actual combat fronts.</p>
                        <p>I believe it would be a good thing to explore this with the Secretary and
                            with the President and with our military officials, and to let me have
                            an initial reaction which I can give to Padilla and to the President.
                                <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0420"/>I am sure that Padilla had
                            talked this over with the President before he mentioned it to me the
                            other day. Of course the explorations should be informal and
                            confidential and there should be nothing publicly said about this until
                            decisions may be reached.</p>
                        <p>… I think the most feasible approach is through air combat units. I
                            should be very happy if you would explore this situation and let me know
                            the reactions in an altogether informal and confidential way which I can
                            pass on to Padilla and the President.</p>
                        <p>With all good wishes,</p>

                            to your note no. 3365 of May 27, 1943, in which you state that a number
                            of Local Boards of the Selective Service System appear to be ignorant of
                            the provisions of the agreement entered into between our Governments on
                            January 22, 1943.</p>
                        <p>This matter has received consideration by the Director of Selective

                            the agreement in question have been transmitted to the State Directors
                            of the States adjoining Mexico, with instructions that copies of the
                            agreement are to be sent to Boards which are known by the State
                            Directors to have a large number of Mexican registrants. The Director of
                            Selective Service has expressed the opinion that this procedure will be
                            sufficient to cure any lack of understanding that may exist among Local
                            Boards.</p>

                            Mexican Ambassador and has the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the
                            Ambassador’s note no. 3986 of July 6, 1943, requesting the inclusion of
                            Mexico in a memorandum addressed to Selective Service Local Boards by
                            the Selective Service System, relating to countries with which
                            reciprocal agreements on military service matters have been
                            concluded.</p>

                        <p>The Embassy’s desire for the inclusion of Mexico in that list has been
                            brought to the attention of the Selective Service System. It will be
                            recalled, however, that in the informal discussions that have taken
                            place on this subject, the Embassy was informed that the Selective
                            Service System does not find it possible to prescribe any special
                            regulations or procedure concerning Mexican registrants. Accordingly,
                            the procedure referred to in Local Board Memorandum no. 129 of the
                            Selective Service System will be applicable to Mexican registrants in
                            exactly the same manner as to registrants of other nationalities.</p>

                            conversation with Dr. Padilla, I wrote to Mr. Welles with regard to the
                            possibility of Mexican armed forces participating in the actual
                            conflict. I did not hear from Mr. Welles and, as Dr. Padilla made
                            reference to this matter again and asked whether I had had a reply to my
                            exploratory letter to Mr. Welles, I wrote to Mr. Welles again on August
                                5<note n="14" xml:id="d355fn14">Not printed.</note> in which I said
                            that Dr. Padilla had raised the question of the possibility of a Mexican
                            air squadron, or squadrons, participating on the actual fighting fronts
                            with our forces. My letters to Mr. Welles of July 6 and August 5 are

                            consideration will be given to the military and strategic factors
                            involved in such participation.</p>
                        <p>I took opportunity yesterday during a conversation with Dr. Padilla to go
                            into this matter with him, and I told him that if the Mexican Government
                            would make some formal proposal it would be possible for our military
                            and naval authorities to consider it. I said <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409"
                                facs="0423"/>that he would appreciate that our people would need
                            something rather concrete to consider before they would be able to
                            really give an answer. The Minister said that he would discuss this
                            matter with the President and let me know the result of the
                            conversation.</p>
                        <p>This letter is merely to keep you informed of the status of this
                            matter.</p>

                            this morning at my request. I invited his attention to the request from
                            the Mexican Embassy to this Government to furnish food rations for
                            Mexican troops stationed in Lower California and charge the expense to
                            Mexico’s credit under the Lend-Lease agreement.<note n="16"

                                    485</ref>.</note> I stated that in the opinion of the Department
                            it would not be advisable to do so as food cannot be properly classified
                            as “armaments and munitions of war.” The Department therefore desired to
                            inquire whether it might not be possible to assist the Mexican
                            Government by selling to it for cash the necessary rations from stocks
                            of the United States Army at fair and reasonable prices.</p>
                        <p>Major Hickman replied that the War Department had been apprised of this
                            matter about two months ago by General Henry<note n="17"
                                xml:id="d356fn17">Gen. Guy V. Henry.</note> of the Joint
                            Mexican-United States Defense Commission. General DeWitt<note n="18"
                                xml:id="d356fn18">Lt. Gen. J. L. DeWitt, Office of the Commanding
                                General, Western Defense Command.</note> was then consulted. He
                            replied that under his present authorization for release of material to
                            the Mexican Army, he would be unable to provide the food, and (2) he
                            felt he would incur difficulties with the local ration authorities in
                            California if he should endeavor to buy these rations in the open
                            market. I gathered that General DeWitt feared that owing to the food
                            situation in the southern part of California, he would incur criticism
                            from the officials of the Price Administration and the public should it
                            become known that the provisions were destined for Mexico. On receipt of
                            General DeWitt’s answer General Henry was duly informed and a suggestion
                            was made to him that he might approach the officials of the Lend-Lease
                            Administration for their views and possible decision. In this connection
                            Major Hickman informed me that no suggestions were made by the War
                            Department <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0424"/>to General Henry
                            that the provisions might be purchased by Mexico under the Lend-Lease
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Major Hickman told me that he would consult Colonel Hertford<note n="19"

                            assist the Mexicans. I expressed the hope that this could be done as the
                            Department did not desire to modify the strict construction of the
                            Lend-Lease agreement.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Ambassador</hi>: Your letter of August 31
                            was most helpful. As you know, the Mexican-United States Defense
                            Commission is having a meeting in Mexico City in the very near future.
                            Shortly following the receipt of your letter Larry<note n="20"
                                xml:id="d357fn20">Laurence Duggan, Adviser on Political
                                Relations.</note> and I ascertained that the United States section
                            of that Commission was completely ignorant of any of the recent
                            developments regarding the possibility of Mexican armed forces
                            participating in combat duty. Your letter drew our attention to this
                            lack of liaison and it has now been remedied.</p>
                        <p>I have furthermore taken the position that it would be most dangerous for
                            the Mexicans to prepare a “formal proposal” without some guidance from
                            us. It seems to me that we might have some kind of informal expression
                            as to the specific ideas which the Mexicans are entertaining regarding
                            such a proposal before we allow the matter to get into the formal stage.
                            I understand, of course, that nothing will happen until the President of
                            Mexico gives his consent in principle to the formulation of a
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>With warm regards,</p>
                        <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                        <p>This matter was referred to the Director of Selective Service, who has

                                    this Headquarters and invite attention to paragraph 1 of Part V
                                    which provides that local boards are instructed to cancel the
                                    registration of nondeclarant alien registrants who left the
                                    United States prior to May 16, 1942, and have not returned. The
                                    memorandum attached is the only instruction which has been

                        <p>The Director of Selective Service adds that he does not believe that the
                            provision mentioned will entitle a Mexican national who lived in the
                            United States after October 16, 1940, and who left this country prior to
                            May 16, 1942, to have his registration canceled and be issued an Alien’s
                            Certificate of Nonresidence (Form 303), if he retained property in this
                            country or regularly crossed the border after leaving. Persons in this
                            status did not leave the United States permanently and do not come

                            agreement as to the desirability of such an arrangement. At present it
                            is possible but difficult to obtain the return to the United States of
                            military deserters through the operations of the Mexican immigration and
                            other laws. So far there have been only a limited number of cases of
                            American deserters in Mexico but the individuals involved have been of
                            particularly undesirable types and haye caused loss of prestige to the
                            United States during the period of time necessary to effect
                            repatriation. It is to be assumed that as time goes on there might be a
                            substantial increase in the number of deserters coming here. These
                            deserters are apt to be criminals or otherwise of such character as to
                            cast discredit upon our country. From our point of view it would,
                            therefore, seem to be wise to anticipate the possible increase in
                            desertions and to have established the machinery for the return of the
                            deserters to the United States. From the Mexican point of view, some
                            such procedure also seems to be desirable. The Mexican military
                            authorities inform us that because of high wages now prevailing in the
                            United States, they anticipate an increase in the number of deserters
                            from the Mexican armed forces. They are anxious to prevent these
                            desertions from their forces into our country. It is quite possible that
                            the existence of such an arrangement would tend to discourage the
                            desertion of Mexicans and this, in an indirect sense, should also be
                            helpful to our Immigration authorities.</p>

                        <p>The Department is requested to inform this Embassy whether the attached
                            draft would be acceptable to our Government. If the draft is not
                            acceptable, it would be helpful to the Embassy to have a counter-draft
                            for informal presentation to the Mexican authorities.</p>

                            at the combat fronts. You will recall the more recent correspondence
                            which covered the developments during the stay of General Marshall<note

                            matter was left that if the Mexican Government had any concrete proposal
                            to make in this direction, our military authorities and our Government
                            would be prepared to consider it.</p>
                        <p>You will recall that in my letters I said that I thought the Mexican
                            Government would prefer for the present to maintain its contact on this
                            matter through the President and the Foreign Minister and this Embassy
                            and that I thought it desirable that the matter be kept out of the Joint
                            Mexican-United States Defense Commission until the matter had become
                            somewhat clarified as to the real Mexican intent.</p>
                        <p>Since the departure of General Marshall and of Admiral Johnson and
                            General Henry I have not discussed this matter with the President of
                            Mexico. I have discussed it in a very informal way on several occasions
                            with Dr. Padilla and have left it clear that the initiative was now up
                            to the Mexican Government to make some concrete proposal. On this point
                            there is no misunderstanding and I think it is definitely our desire
                            that the approach should come from them, if any is made, and that we
                            should not push them towards any action.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>I know that the President and the Foreign Minister have been thinking in
                            terms of one or more squadrons of air men who might <pb n="414"
                                xml:id="pg_414" facs="0428"/>after due training participate at some
                            of the combat fronts. This to my mind is the only feasible form, of
                            Mexican participation to begin with. It is to my mind the only feasible
                            form from the political point of view as well as from the practical
                            point of view. Although Mexican public opinion is better prepared for
                            such participation, there is a good section of the public opinion which
                            is not yet prepared for it. I think, therefore, that it is unlikely that
                            the Mexican Government will make any proposal for sending land troops. I
                            know that the President and the Foreign Minister will think in terms of
                            air squadrons because they are realistic.</p>

                        <p>I wonder whether President Avila Camacho’s remarks as heard over the
                            radio yesterday morning do not tend to solve our problem of Mexican
                            participation in actual combat.<note n="29" xml:id="d362fn29">The
                                President indicated that under certain circumstances Mexican
                                soldiers would take part in the war within Mexico or outside of the
                                country.</note> The impression which I gather is that there is no
                            great enthusiasm in the President’s mind for any large-scale Mexican
                            participation and I should also judge that the President does not plan
                            to take any initiative.</p>
                        <p>Heretofore our attitude has been one of receptiveness toward any Mexican
                            initiative. It now appears to me that we should probably get together
                            with the War Department and work out some proposal to be submitted
                            informally through Ambassador Messersmith to President Avila Camacho.
                            This proposal would be based upon the fact that we have at present in
                            training sufficient ground troops for the military operations
                            contemplated but that we would welcome Mexican assistance in the air. I
                            think the War Department could prepare something rather specific for
                            Ambassador Messersmith. If you think well of this idea, might it not be
                            desirable for us to have a meeting with Colonel Hertford in order to
                            agree upon methods of procedure.<note n="30" xml:id="d362fn30">The

                                added this notation: “I concur with Mr. Duggan. In checking with the

                            newspapers as having stated: “Up to the present time our Allies have not
                            requested Mexican contingents to fight at the fronts of the present

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department refers to the Embassy’s
                            despatch no. 13101 of September 20, 1943, transmitting an informal draft
                            of an exchange of notes providing for the reciprocal exchange of
                            military deserters. The Ambassador states that the draft was handed to
                            him by the Mexican Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>The draft was submitted to the War and Navy Departments for their
                            comments. The War Department stated in its reply that the laws of
                            military service of Mexico and the Selective Service laws of the United
                            States are radically different and added that, in its opinion, it would
                            be inadvisable to enter into an agreement with Mexico based upon a
                            similarity of the operation of those laws. The War Department pointed
                            out, for instance, that the proposed agreement goes far beyond the
                            return of deserters from the armed forces of Mexico and would oblige the
                            United States to return not only deserters from the active forces but
                            also those classified as deserters from the reserves <pb n="416"
                                xml:id="pg_416" facs="0430"/>and those who have been recruited or
                            registered for military service. As the Military Service laws of Mexico
                            are understood to require the registration for military service of all
                            male Mexicans when becoming eighteen years of age and to render such
                            persons liable for military service—active or reserve—until they are
                            forty-five years of age, the proposal of the Mexican Government would
                            oblige the United States to return to Mexico upon demand any such person
                            whom the Mexican Government desired to classify as a deserter. Upon
                            further inquiry the War Department advised the Department that it does
                            not consider that any agreement on the subject with the Mexican
                            Government is necessary.</p>
                        <p>The Navy Department has stated that it is agreeable to the terms of the
                            agreement submitted by the Mexican Government but suggests that in
                            addition to any arrangement which the Department of State may consider
                            proper and valid consideration be given to utilizing the immigration and
                            deportation laws of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Department agrees with the War Department that the proposal of the
                            Mexican Government is unacceptable. In its present form it would oblige
                            this Government to return to Mexico persons who might be liable for
                            military service under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940,
                            or who might be in the armed forces of the United States. As any
                            arrangement based on an exchange of notes would not have the effect of
                            changing existing laws or of enabling this Government to return to
                            Mexico persons who cannot now be returned, no purpose is seen in
                            entering into such an arrangement. The number of deserters from the
                            United States forces who are in Mexico seems to be small and it seems
                            probable that a like condition exists as to deserters from the active
                            forces of Mexico who are in the United States. No reason is seen why,
                            with good will on both sides, such deserters cannot be returned without
                            an agreement of the kind proposed. It may be added that some months ago
                            the Department had under consideration with the Canadian Government the
                            question of an agreement concerning the return of deserters from the
                            military forces of both governments and it was concluded that such an
                            agreement was not necessary.</p>

                        <p>Just before leaving for Washington on Saturday, June 26, Mr. Valentin
                            Garfías, a member of the Mexican Commission, summed up his idea of the
                            accomplishments of the joint Commission as follows. He said that in
                            reality the Mexicans viewed the short-term accomplishments as
                            satisfactory, but that too much stress and space had been placed on
                            long-term projects. He said the Mexican people were expecting immediate
                            results and that, if in the announcements and final documents to be
                            signed, the short-term benefits were not stressed, the Mexican people
                            would gain the impression that another commission had ended its labors
                            without giving immediate relief from a bad economic situation. Mr.
                            Garfías emphasized that immediate benefits so far agreed to were
                            satisfactory and that they should by all means be stressed. He added
                            that the projects for the future were also praiseworthy, but that they
                            should occupy less space and prominence than those agreements designed
                            to give immediate relief. Mr. Garfías made one further observation. He
                            said that the Mexicans realized that there were many Departments and
                            Agencies of Government in Washington which must give their consent
                            before many of the important agreements reached by the Mexican-American
                            Commission <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0433"/>for Economic
                            Cooperation could become effective. He said that he and a number of the
                            higher officials of the Mexican Government were quite confident that a
                            satisfactory agreement would be reached by the Commission, but they
                            carried in the back of their minds the apprehension that when there are
                            too many fingers in the pie it is apt to be spoiled. Actually what he
                            meant does not need any explanation, as “too many fingers in the pie”
                            refers to our many Agencies of Government upon which the fulfillment of
                            the Agreements depends.</p>

                        <p>It is understood that upon the agreement of President Avila Camacho the
                            portion of the report to be published will be released jointly in Mexico
                            City and Washington. The Department has no objection to the joint
                            release with the exception of one sentence on page 2 which reads as
                            follows: “The specific recommendations of the Commission appear in an
                            annex to the general report which follows.” The Department feels that
                            either no reference should be made to the annexes which are not to be
                            published or it should be specifically stated that the annex or annexes
                            cannot be revealed for the duration of the war for security reasons.</p>
                        <p>The Department will await word from you regarding the time of the joint
                            release of the general section of the report. A copy of the general
                            section of the report is being airmailed to you.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State informs the Embassy that during the past few weeks
                            there has been considerable discussion of the Report of the
                            Mexican-American Commission for Economic Coordination within the
                            Department and in Interdepartmental Committees with particular reference
                            in each instance to the possibilities for its prompt implementation.
                            While the information given in the reports of the various committees is
                            reasonably complete, nevertheless, in certain cases further
                            investigation apparently is needed before active support should be given
                            to all recommended projects by the Department. In two types of projects
                            particularly there appears to be insufficient information as a basis for
                            decisions on the granting of export licenses and priority assistance,
                            i.e., the Department is in doubt as to whether support should be given
                            to all of the cement and irrigation projects which were recommended.
                            Each class of project will be considered in turn.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Irrigation Projects:</hi></p>
                        <p>In the Sub-Committee’s report on agriculture, various irrigation projects
                            are strongly recommended, in addition to El Palmito. The Sub-Committee
                            states that “emphasis must be laid on the completion of projects that
                            are furthest advanced and which will make the greatest contribution to
                            the war effort of the United Nations and to the essential economy of
                            Mexico.” The Report thus indicates that the present state of completion
                            should be depended upon to determine priority. However, of the projects
                            listed in Appendix G to the Sub-Committee’s Report, nine are shown to be
                            less than twenty percent completed and four of these less than ten
                            percent completed. In view of this fact, state of completion is of
                            little significance in determining priority. Surely other factors are
                            likewise of significance in establishing priority; for instance the
                            amount of equipment needed for completion, the acreage which will be
                            released for cultivation, the location of that acreage in relation to
                            the location of consuming markets, and the type of crop for which the
                            acreage is adapted.</p>
                        <p>It is considered that the determination of priority is highly essential.
                            The completion of all of the nineteen projects recommended would require
                            a substantial amount of equipment in short supply, such as trucks,
                            trailers, plows, excavators and pumps. In view of this fact, it does not
                            appear at all likely that sufficient equipment can be made available,
                            either second-hand or new to complete all projects. Licenses covering
                            small amounts of equipment are currently being <pb n="421"
                                xml:id="pg_421" facs="0435"/>approved but in order to guide the
                            various interested agencies, it appears to the Department that priority
                            should be established through additional study by the Embassy in
                            cooperation with the appropriate Mexican authorities.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Cement:</hi></p>
                        <p>In accordance with the Commission’s recommendations, all possible aid is
                            being given to secure needed materials for Fábrica de Cemento, Estación
                            Lagunas, Oaxaca; and Cemento de Mixcoac, S. A. Through the completion of
                            these projects, together with the other five projects included in the
                            short-range or immediate expansion of the cement industry, the rated
                            annual production capacity of Mexico will be increased approximately
                            forty-six percent above the 1942 level (from 651,600 to 950,400 tons).
                            If and when the other cement projects listed by the Commission are
                            completed, the rated capacity will be increased an additional seventy
                            percent to 1,607,400 tons. Applications for export licenses have been
                            received covering certain of these projects and are now pending before
                            the Office of Economic Warfare or the War Production Board.</p>
                        <p>It is not probable that the War Production Board will release the
                            equipment necessary, both new and second-hand, for all of these
                            projects. Therefore, it is necessary to ascertain which of them are the
                            most deserving of support by the Department. There may be some doubt as
                            to whether all are needed in view of the fact that if all were furnished
                            equipment and put into operation, the rated capacity for production of
                            cement in Mexico would be approximately three times the capacity in
                            1942.</p>
                        <p>In view of these recommendations, it is requested that the Embassy
                            further investigate the need for additional cement plants and indicate
                            those which the Department should support in the Office of Economic
                            Warfare and the War Production Board. Although it is recognized that
                            this may make necessary a short delay in further expansion, such a delay
                            is not considered too important in as much as the short-range program to
                            meet emergencies in the cement supply has been largely completed.</p>

                        <p>The American Commissioners<note n="35" xml:id="d370fn35">Members of the
                                Mexican-American Industrial Commission established pursuant to the
                                report of the Mexican-American Commission for Economic
                                Cooperation.</note> agreed that a coordinated and over-all
                            development of the economy of Mexico, centered in a single Commission,
                            would bring much more satisfactory results than a number of separate
                            commissions working on specialized subjects without coordination. Mr.
                            Taylor pointed out that the suggestion made by the Mexican Commissioners
                            of an over-all economic commission was very similar to the way an
                            Embassy coordinates the various activities undertaken by it. For
                            example, an Embassy, headed by an Ambassador, is the over-all body which
                            coordinates within itself all activities of the American Government in a
                            given country. It has its special sections and officers that operate in
                            specialized fields, such as the Military and Naval Attachés, the
                            Agricultural Attaché, the Commercial Attaché, the political officers,
                            the consular officers, etc. Although these specialized sections and
                            officers operate in their particular fields, they are all coordinated
                            under the supervision and direction of the Embassy and the Ambassador.
                            Mr. Taylor pointed out that the Mexican suggestion to convert the
                            present Industrial Commission into an over-all economic development
                            commission was nothing other than the plan now followed by an Embassy
                            with its various specialized sections and officers. The American
                            Commissioners agreed with the Mexican Commissioners that the two
                            Governments should be very urgently requested to consider the present
                            Commission as a continuation of the former Mexican-American Commission
                            for Economic Cooperation, with facilities as broad as those of the
                            latter.</p>
                        <p>In summary, the points being placed before the Department for action are,
                            1) that the present Industrial Commission be considered as a
                            continuation of the Mexican-American Commission for Economic
                            Cooperation, with facilities as broad as those of the latter and with a
                            field of action as vast as may be necessary for the study of the general
                            problems of economic cooperation between the two countries, and 2) that
                            the name of the present Commission be changed to Mexican-American
                            Commission for Economic Cooperation.</p>
                        <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0437"/>
                        <p>There is one additional important point to which the Department’s
                            attention is respectfully directed. During discussions between the
                            American and Mexican Commissioners, there was always an emphasis on the
                            importance of a rapid clearance of recommendations which would be made
                            by the Commission through the Embassy to the Department and then to the
                            claimant and licensing Agencies of our Government. A copy of all
                            recommendations and other documents pertaining to the Commission will be
                            forwarded through the Department to the Coordinator of Inter-American
                            Affairs. At the same time, the regular number of copies are being
                            forwarded for the use of the Department. The members of the Commission
                            here in Mexico and the officers of the Embassy charged with such work
                            will study and examine each recommendation which is forwarded to
                            Washington. As always, on recommendations of importance the Ambassador
                            will be fully consulted. Under the circumstances, the Department is
                            requested to indicate its action on the recommendations which it
                            receives from the Embassy to the American Commissioners in Washington as
                            quickly as possible. Messrs. Rockefeller and Taylor stated that they
                            would confer with the Department concerning the establishment of a
                            liaison between them and the Department with respect to these matters.
                            Also, it was left for decision in Washington as to who, or, which
                            Agencies or Department in Washington would be the claimant before the
                            War Production Board. The Commission feels quite sure that it will
                            receive the fullest cooperation of the Department relative to the rapid
                            despatch of recommendations which are forwarded to it by the Commission
                            through the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy is quite confident that the Mexican-American Industrial
                            Commission has gotten off to a rapid and successful start. The splendid
                            cooperation and aid of Ambassador Messersmith and high officials of the
                            Mexican Government give further assurance that the results desired by
                            the two Presidents will be largely realized.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State encloses with this communication a copy of a
                            memorandum on the present status of projects recommended by the
                            Mexican-American Commission for Economic Cooperation dated <pb n="424"
                                xml:id="pg_424" facs="0438"/>September 20, 1943.<note n="36"
                                xml:id="d371fn36">Not printed; it recommended two agricultural
                                projects (El Palmito Dam and miscellaneous irrigation plans); eight
                                hydroelectric and diesel plants; the completion or equipping of
                                eight steel mills; the equipping of eight cement plants; one project
                                each for rubber and sugar industries; the equipping of six pulp and
                                paper factories; two chemical projects; three textiles projects; and
                                the equipping of two miscellaneous factories.</note> This is a
                            slightly revised memorandum based on one dated September 10, 1943 which
                            was transmitted to the Embassy some days ago by third person and without
                            comment.</p>
                        <p>This memorandum, it will be observed, consists of two sections one of
                            which indicates the present status of the recommended projects while the
                            other attempts to classify these projects on the basis of status. In the
                            second section of the memorandum there are sixteen projects listed for
                            which applications have not as yet been submitted to the Office of
                            Economic Warfare. Although, quite obviously, the recommendations of the
                            Commission on specific projects cannot be implemented until applications
                            are submitted to the Office of Economic Warfare, nevertheless, it is
                            suggested that no particular effort be made by the Embassy to stimulate
                            the immediate submittal of applications on these projects. It is
                            considered more advisable to let the projects mature in a normal manner
                            rather than to urge immediate action at this time unless instructions to
                            do so on specific projects are received from the Department. Otherwise
                            the presumption might be established in the minds of interested parties
                            that approval of applications when submitted on recommended projects
                            would be extremely likely if not certain. In reality the fact of
                            recommendation by the Commission is simply additional evidence that a
                            project has unusual merit and should be accorded all possible
                            consideration by the various Government agencies entrusted with the
                            power of decision on such matters.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy is requested to go over this memorandum carefully in an
                            attempt to determine whether there are either errors of fact or
                            statements of opinion which are not in conformance with the considered
                            judgment of responsible officers in the Embassy. The Department requests
                            any additional information on the recommended projects which may be
                            available in Mexico and which, it is considered, is of sufficient
                            importance for transmittal. It is anticipated that further statements in
                            regard to the status of projects will be prepared at periodic
                            intervals.</p>

                            Fábricas de Papel de San Rafael y Anexas, S.A., for completion of a
                            Kraft Pulp Plant. It is noted that in both the airgram and despatch
                            under reference the Embassy indicates its desire that the necessary
                            machinery and equipment be supplied outside of Mexico’s estimate of
                            supply for general requirements and the existing estimate of supply for
                            projects. It is noted that for this reason the Mexican Imports
                            Coordination Committee has not issued an Export Recommendation in either
                            case.</p>
                        <p>As the Embassy is no doubt aware, the estimate of supply set aside for
                            general requirements and for country projects represents the total
                            amount of materials (including B products) which the War Production
                            Board has indicated can be made available out of total production, after
                            taking into account the requirements of the armed forces, the civilian
                            requirements of the United States, the requirements of our fighting
                            Allies, and the requirements of the Latin American republics other than
                            Mexico. Therefore, it is impossible to supply critical materials and
                            equipment to Mexico outside of its allocation, without a corresponding
                            reduction in the amount of materials supplied to meet other
                            requirements. It is, of course, possible to accommodate small requests
                            outside of allocation, by charging these to the contingency reserve
                            which is maintained for that purpose. However, when the materials are
                            substantial in amount, the Office of Economic Warfare can only
                            accommodate the request by securing an additional allocation or by
                            increasing its overall request to the War Production Board in subsequent
                            quarters.</p>
                        <p>It is noted that the above two projects are not the only projects which
                            the Embassy or the Industrial Commission have recommended for licensing
                            outside of allocation. If these projects are approved and materials
                            provided by increasing the requests presented to the War Production
                            Board, it is inevitable that the requirements for must be supplied at
                            the expense of the requirements of our armed forces, our own civilian
                            requirements or other export requirements. Production of materials is
                            not yet sufficient to meet all necessary requirements of the war effort.
                            Even more critical is the production of machinery and equipment, because
                            of the shortage of skilled labor in the United States. The Embassy is,
                            therefore, again cautioned to approve only essential projects. Such
                            projects should be covered by Export Recommendations in all cases.
                            Wherever there is an existing estimate of supply, a charge should be
                            made thereto. If this is impossible because of the relatively small
                            estimate of supply, the Embassy <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0440"
                            />should recommend an increase in subsequent estimates of supply. It
                            should be realized that such large projects cannot be passed without
                            some sacrifice on the part of the Mexican general requirements. How
                            great this sacrifice will be must be decided in Washington in the light
                            of other demands upon supply.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy is therefore informed that under present procedures of the
                            Office of Economic Warfare, an Export Recommendation will be required
                            for the expansion of the facilities of Cía. Fundidora, as well as for
                            the Kraft Pulp Plant of Cía. de las Fábricas de Papel de San Rafael y
                            Anexas, S. A. It is further suggested that, if the Mexican Estimates of
                            Supply are insufficient to provide the materials required by these
                            Projects, the Embassy indicate the maximum amounts of materials which
                            may be charged to the regular estimates of supply without interfering
                            with the normal minimum requirements of Mexico’s wartime economy and the
                            extent to which it will be necessary to increase subsequent estimates of
                            supply if these projects are authorized.</p>
                        <p>The War Production Board has indicated informally to the Department that
                            in all probability, it will not approve the San Rafael Project. It must
                            therefore be emphasized that the chances of securing favorable action at
                            the War Production Board in the case of both Projects will be
                            substantially enhanced if a considerable portion of the Project
                            requirements may be met from the regular Mexican Estimates of
                            Supply.</p>

                            Department’s airgram No. 2756 of October 25, 1943 advising the Embassy
                            and the Resident Member of the Mexican-American Commission<note n="39"

                                Commissioners and Secretary of the American Section of the
                                Mexican-American Industrial Commission.</note> for Economic
                            Cooperation that all projects recommended by the Embassy or the
                            Commission should be accompanied by export recommendations for materials
                            and products included in the projects and which are under an estimate of
                            supply. The Embassy and the Resident Commissioner are cautioned not to
                            expect any appreciable increase in estimates of supply and, therefore,
                            to approve only those projects of the greatest necessity. The Department
                            in the aforementioned airgram explains that the War Production Board
                            established estimates of supply for <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427"
                                facs="0441"/>Mexico after determining the quantity of materials
                            which could be spared from the war effort of the Allied Nations and,
                            consequently, should the estimates of supply for Mexico be substantially
                            increased it would have to be done at the expense of the armed forces,
                            the civilian population of the United States or the estimates of supply
                            for the other nations.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy does not raise any question as to the soundness of the policy
                            adopted by the Department and the other interested agencies of the
                            Government. It is realized that the armed forces must come first and
                            that Mexico must be content to share equitably with the civilian
                            population of our country and with the other nations allied with us for
                            the war effort. Nevertheless, it is very true that the conversation
                            between President Camacho and President Roosevelt in Monterrey resulted
                            in the formation of the former Mexican-American Commission for Economic
                            Cooperation and, as a result, Mexico received the impression that it was
                            intended that something special would be done to aid it in the
                            development of its industrial, agricultural and other types of economic
                            development. At the recommendation of the former Mexican-American
                            Commission for Economic Cooperation the present Commission of the same
                            name was created and is now functioning. During the first two meetings
                            of the present Commission further encouragement was given to the
                            Mexicans that they would receive special consideration in reference to
                            materials and equipment for the construction of urgent and essential
                            industries. The foregoing has been related so that the Department and
                            the interested agencies of our Government will see that the Mexicans
                            have been encouraged to have false hopes. If the policy to be followed
                            by the Commission is that of recommending only those projects containing
                            materials under estimate of supply which can be spared from the general
                            requirements, then, the usefulness of the Commission in aiding economic
                            development through the establishment of essential industries during the
                            war emergency would be negligible. Under such circumstances the
                            Commission would be principally confined to studying and recommending
                            industries for construction and development after the emergency period.
                            The Mexicans are principally interested in the assistance that they can
                            secure now or during the period of emergency and they believe the
                            Commission was established in a large measure for that purpose. They
                            realize that long-term planning is a very advantageous thing but they
                            feel that after the war equipment will be in much freer supply and
                            Mexico will be able to purchase materials and develop industrially with
                            little interference. Whether their viewpoint will prove to be right or
                            wrong, that is the way they feel. They wish to receive all assistance
                            for long-time industrial development which the Commission can render,
                            but, their principal <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0442"/>and vital
                            interest is in what the Commission can do for them during the
                            emergency.</p>
                        <p>When the Mexicans are advised that export recommendations for materials
                            under estimate of supply must accompany projects recommended by the
                            Commission, it will be a great disappointment to them. It is unfortunate
                            that in the beginning they obtained the impression that they would
                            receive some special consideration and assistance for industrial
                            development during the emergency period. Two members of the Mexican
                            section of the Mexican-American Commission for Economic Cooperation
                            received word indirectly from Washington that materials and equipment
                            under estimate of supply which form a part of a project recommended by
                            the Commission would have to be in part or in whole deducted from
                            Mexico’s general requirements. The statement of these two Mexican
                            Commissioners to the American Resident Commissioner was to the effect
                            that if this proved to be true it would be a great disappointment to the
                            Mexican Government and to the Mexican people because the effectiveness
                            of the Commission would be seriously reduced.</p>
                        <p>According to the Department’s instruction No. 4768 of November 15,
                                1943<note n="40" xml:id="d373fn40">Not printed.</note> and
                            discussions already held with officials of the Mexican Government in
                            relation to a “roll-back” of the decentralization plan,<note n="41"
                                xml:id="d373fn41">For correspondence on the plan to decentralize
                                export controls, see <ref target="frus1943v05#pg_106">vol. <hi
                                        rend="smallcaps">v</hi>, pp. 106</ref> ff.</note> it is very
                            probable that many types of machinery, including industrial machinery,
                            will be removed from decentralization and the requirement of export
                            recommendation on January 1, 1944. If this takes place, then Mexico will
                            not be issuing export recommendations for industrial machinery and,
                            therefore, there will not exist any means of complying with the
                            instruction contained in airgram 2756 of October 25, 1943. The Foreign
                            Economic Administration will be issuing licenses without a reference to
                            the Mexican Government and the latter will not be in a position to say
                            whether or not its general requirements will stand a deduction for an
                            industrial project because it will have no knowledge of what has or what
                            has not been licensed in Washington.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that the Department will readily understand that the
                            Mexican-American Commission for Economic Cooperation is in quite a
                            quandary at the present time as to just what procedure it should follow
                            in recommending industrial projects. During this period of uncertainty I
                            have recommended to the Resident American Commissioner that the American
                            section of the Commission proceed with its detailed study of all
                            projects presented to it by the Mexican section. I have requested that
                            the American section study with great care the machinery requirements of
                            each project so that when it is recommended <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429"
                                facs="0443"/>it will contain the maximum of used equipment in order
                            to reduce the requirement for new machinery and scarce materials. I have
                            further requested that projects requiring immediate or prompt delivery
                            of substantial quantities of new equipment be recommended only after a
                            very careful consideration of their urgency.</p>
                        <p>Relative to the instruction contained in the airgram No. 2756 of October
                            25, 1943 to the effect that all projects recommended by the Commission
                            should be accompanied by an export recommendation for materials under
                            estimate of supply, I am sure that the Department will readily
                            understand that the Mexican Government has already issued export
                            recommendations which will absorb the estimates of supply up to January
                            1, 1944 and, therefore, no further recommendations can be issued against
                            the estimate for this year. As it now seems probable that new machinery
                            and equipment will not require export recommendations after January 1,
                            1944, it will be impossible for the Commission to comply with the
                            Department’s instruction. However, as the Commission will use the
                            greatest care and discretion in recommending industrial projects which
                            require prompt delivery of new machinery, I feel confident that it will
                            be complying as closely as possible with the Department’s wishes until
                            further instructions are received in regard to its procedure.</p>

                            interest in and need for wheat, the Department of Agriculture was
                            prepared to institute a wheat export program on the basis of payments in
                            connection with exports not to exceed 25 cents per bushel.</p>
                        <p>I have now received a report from the Secretary of Agriculture informing
                            me that the program was announced on December 2, 1942 on the basis of an
                            export subsidy of 20 cents per bushel. He further <pb n="430"

                            subsidy rate was increased to 25 cents per bushel.</p>
                        <p>Referring to further developments in this connection, the communication
                            from the Secretary of Agriculture reads in part as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>We are informed that the Mexican Government has just negotiated
                                    contracts for the purchase of around 2½ million bushels of
                                    Canadian wheat, and that it was planned to move this grain
                                    through the United States by rail. I am informed, however, that
                                    the War Production Board and the Office of Defense
                                    Transportation, in the interest of national defense and the war
                                    effort, are opposed to the use of large quantities of United
                                    States rail equipment and labor for such an extended haul and
                                    have accordingly taken steps to halt such movement. This
                                    decision was taken in the light of the fact that the United
                                    States has large stocks of wheat in Texas and Oklahoma, which
                                    are readily available for shipment to Mexico.</p>
                                <p>We trust that the Mexican Government may be made fully aware of
                                    the strain now being placed on United States rail transportation
                                    facilities by the expanding war effort and informed that the
                                    proposed movement of Canadian wheat across the United States
                                    would seriously interfere with defense needs of the United
                                    Nations. At the same time, however, I would like to point out
                                    that the Department of Agriculture, through its action in
                                    raising the subsidy rate to the maximum level of 25 cents per
                                    bushel, will be making wheat available at Laredo, Texas, basis
                                    present market prices, at approximately the same net price basis
                                    reported in the recent Mexican purchase of Canadian wheat.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Ambassador</hi>: As there may be some
                            reaction in Mexico, we think it would be well for you to have some
                            background information on the following matter:</p>
                        <p>In October of last year, the Mexican Embassy addressed a note to this
                            Department asking this Government to assist Mexico to obtain between
                            150,000 and 200,000 tons of wheat in the United States, F.O.B. Laredo,
                            Texas, at a price of about one dollar a bushel.</p>
                        <p>Eventually arrangements were made for the establishment of a wheat export
                            program whereby the Department of Agriculture would pay a subsidy of 25
                            cents per bushel on wheat bought by foreign governments in accordance
                            with this program, thus providing for a lower price. In the case of
                            Mexico, arrangements were made for a subsidy which in the beginning was
                            25 cents a bushel and later 30 cents a bushel, on some five million
                            bushels of wheat in January and, <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0445"
                            />apparently, between one and three million bushels more wheat during
                            recent months.</p>
                        <p>Recently, the Department of Agriculture found that it would be necessary
                            to stop granting this subsidy, as the funds which Agriculture had had
                            for this purpose had been exhausted. In the circumstances, the
                            Department of Agriculture found that its subsidy program would have to
                            expire May 14, 1943, at 2 p.m., and published a statement to that
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>On May 12, the Mexican Chargé d’Affaires<note n="44" xml:id="d375fn44"
                                >Rafael de la Colina.</note> called on me to discuss this matter. He
                            pointed out that Mexico had devoted much of her efforts to the
                            production of war and other materials, and had diverted this effort from
                            wheat producing. He said that Mexico had done this on the basis of her
                            belief that she was able to buy wheat either from Canada, from the
                            United States, or from the Argentine. He said that wheat was currently
                            available in Canada for a little bit under a dollar a bushel and that
                            Mexico would be glad to buy it there, but that she realized our
                            transportation situation was such it would be difficult to be able to
                            take care of large wheat shipments by rail from Canada to Mexico. He
                            then said that Mexico wanted to contract for seven and one-half million
                            bushels of wheat prior to the expiration of the program, and he asked
                            for all possible assistance from the Department.</p>
                        <p>In the premises, I telephoned Mr. Leslie A. Wheeler, Director of Foreign
                            Agricultural Relations, shortly after the Chargé left my office. Mr.
                            Wheeler said he would look into the matter and would call me back this
                            morning. He called me back around 10 o’clock today and said that he was
                            very sorry but Agriculture was not in a position to make available to
                            the Mexican Government for this wheat the export subsidy which had
                            heretofore existed. Accordingly, this was communicated immediately to
                            the Mexican Embassy.</p>
                        <p>From what I gather, the quantity of wheat available next month will be
                            about what it is today. There is no doubt in our minds but that the
                            Mexicans are simply anxious to avoid paying the full price for the
                            wheat. Actually, of course, they would only be paying the full domestic
                            price next month. If it is considered that the subsidy on the wheat they
                            now request runs to two and a quarter millions of dollars, you will
                            readily see how it is that there is some hesitation in pushing this
                            matter further. Also, this would mean that the consumer in this country
                            would have to pay about $1.50 for wheat while the consumer in Mexico
                            would get his wheat on a basis of $1.20 a bushel.</p>
                        <p>There does not seem to be any assurance that Agriculture will endeavor to
                            renew its export subsidy program the next fiscal year. <pb n="432"
                                xml:id="pg_432" facs="0446"/>If it is renewed, Mexico will of course
                            be in a position to share in its benefits equally with any other
                            countries to which it may be granted.</p>
                        <p>So far as shipping wheat from Canada to Mexico is concerned, I may say
                            that it is estimated a shipment of two million bushels would require
                            about 1,500 freight cars according to figures of the Office of Defense
                            Transportation. I have not checked these figures, but I assume they are
                            accurate. Obviously, it would be just about impossible to allocate the
                            5,500 [<hi rend="italic">1,500</hi>] freight cars necessary for such a
                            shipment. Also, I wonder as to the capacity of the Mexican railroads to
                            handle such a sudden, large influx of cars.</p>

                        <p>A–2208. The following for your background information in the event the
                            Foreign Office should discuss with you its request for 15,000 tons of
                            corn: On July 22 the Mexican Embassy sent the Department a
                                memorandum<note n="46" xml:id="d376fn46">Not printed.</note> stating
                            that instructions had been received from Mexico City to take up with the
                            Department the matter of obtaining as a loan of between 15,000 and
                            20,000 tons of corn to be returned by the Mexican Government within a
                            period of one year. The memorandum stated that the Mexican Government
                            was prepared to make a bank deposit for the appropriate amount
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>We explored the matter with Agriculture and, through that Department, the
                            Commodity Credit Corporation. Both of these agencies have informed us
                            that they have no government corn to lend or for sale, and that there is
                            no corn on the free market in this country for the present.</p>
                        <p>In the event that corn comes on the market we will of course do
                            everything possible to help the Mexican Government procure the corn.</p>

                            obtain would be used purely for purposes of food supply or for purposes

                                of the American Republics.</note> regarding Mexico’s request for 15
                            to 20 thousand tons of corn. I assure you that we have thoroughly
                            explored the situation here through Agriculture and Commodity Credit
                            Corporation. There is not a ton of corn to be had on the market in any
                            place in the United States according to these two agencies, and there is
                            no possibility of requisitioning it. The farmers just will not sell
                            their corn and it is not coming on the market.</p>
                        <p>Just prior to your telephone conversation with McGurk this morning we had
                            been exploring with Agriculture and Commodity Credit the possibility of
                            getting some corn from Cuba. We learned that Commodity Credit had bought
                            up the Cuban surplus and that there was a possibility of obtaining some
                            of it for Mexico. Shortly thereafter Mr. de la Colina, the Counselor of
                            the Mexican Embassy, telephoned McGurk and said that they had had an
                            urgent message from the Foreign Office in Mexico City to request us to
                            explore the possibility of obtaining on an urgent basis up to 15,000
                            tons of Cuban corn through our agencies. We have this under way now, and
                            Commodity Credit has promised to let us know in two days just how much
                            corn can be delivered to Mexico. We have informed the Mexican Embassy
                            that the transaction must be on a cash basis and they have agreed. Mr.
                            McGurk will keep you currently informed of the progress we may make
                            toward getting some Cuban corn to satisfy the Mexican demand.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: During the last two months
                            or six weeks, the President of Mexico and high officials of the Mexican
                            Government have been speaking to me about the serious situation which
                            has developed already in Mexico with respect to corn.</p>
                        <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0448"/>
                        <p>Corn, as you know, is the staple food of the great mass of the twenty
                            millions of Mexicans. Ordinarily, Mexico is self-sufficient with respect
                            to corn and it is the principal crop of the country. There have been
                            corn shortages in the past due to droughts or bad crops, but in that
                            case, it was always easily possible to import corn from us to make up
                            the deficit.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the programs of various agencies of our Government
                            interested in the procurement of strategic agricultural products, in
                            this case particularly oil-bearing seeds, we have entered into a number
                            of agreements with Mexico for the production of such oil-bearing seeds.
                            As a result, the farmers in the lowlands, which, as you know are the
                            more tropical areas in Mexico, and where they can raise three crops of
                            corn in a year on one piece of ground, have already turned a good part
                            of their corn land into oil-bearing seed crops. They do this because the
                            returns are much better from such oil-bearing seeds than from corn. The
                            result is that there is already a serious shortage of corn.</p>
                        <p>President Avila Camacho has stressed this situation to me, with its
                            consequent economic and political repercussions if the great mass of the
                            Mexican people are not able to get corn, which is their staple food, or
                            if they have to pay too high a price for it. It means economic and
                            political disorder in this country if this corn shortage cannot be met.
                            Something will have to be done about it, and although our people at home
                            have been giving attention to this matter as a result of my reports, we
                            have, as you know, a serious situation with respect to corn at home,
                            which is due not so much to actual shortage as to withholding from the
                            market because of dissatisfaction with the ceiling price. The Mexican
                            Government is prepared to pay whatever price may be necessary to get the
                            corn it urgently needs from us and to distribute it to the Mexican
                            people at the present prevailing price in Mexico, making up the
                            difference through a subsidy which the Mexican Government will have to
                            provide.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that I have been unable to give any encouraging
                            information to the President of Mexico about corn from home, and as the
                            situation here is growing more serious every day, the President is
                            sending tomorrow to the United States, Dr. Francisco del Rio Canedo. He
                            will get in touch with the Department upon his arrival and, through the
                            Department of State, with appropriate officials of our Government. Mr.
                            Bonsal, in the State Department, has already been in touch with Justice
                                Byrnes<note n="50" xml:id="d378fn50">James F. Byrnes, Director,
                                Office of War Mobilization.</note> on this matter, who sees great
                            difficulties, and these I understand.</p>
                        <p>The reason that I am writing you about this matter is because the
                            situation is really serious. If Mexico cannot get some corn, it will <pb
                                n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0449"/>have serious repercussions in
                            the economic and political life of this country where, fortunately,
                            there is more order than has prevailed here for many years in the past.
                            The whole program of the Mexican Government will be endangered and its
                            stability will be endangered if corn cannot be got to meet the needs of
                            the great mass of the Mexican people.</p>
                        <p>The total amount involved to meet the deficit here is not large. Mexico’s
                            program of production of strategic materials in which we are so much
                            interested for war purposes, is going to be seriously endangered if this
                            primary food problem which is confined to corn, cannot be met.</p>
                        <p>I should appreciate very much your bringing this matter to the attention
                            of Justice Byrnes and I am sure that, through his collaboration and that
                            of the high officers of our Government who can be helpful in this
                            matter, a solution can be found. The problem is both an emergency and a
                            long-range one. There is immediate necessity for corn from our country
                            for Mexico, as it cannot be got from anywhere else in time to meet the
                            situation. It may be that in addition to this immediate situation,
                            Justice Byrnes and others will have to give consideration to a
                            longer-range problem for at least a year, which affects both Mexico and
                            ourselves.</p>
                        <p>You may be sure that I would not bring this matter to your attention if
                            it were not a matter of primary importance and I have the deep
                            conviction that it is just as important in some ways for us as it is for
                            the Mexicans that the economic and political order now so happily
                            prevailing in Mexico should be maintained. You know what can happen when
                            people get hungry, and you know that such things can happen more easily
                            in Mexico than in some other places.</p>
                        <p>I have written a very long letter to Mr. Bonsai,<note n="51"

                            sending a copy of that letter to Secretary Hull; I am also asking Mr.
                            Bonsai to make a copy available to Justice Byrnes immediately.</p>

                            important so far as our whole relationships with Mexico and the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Messersmith</hi>: I have talked with
                            Justice Byrnes about your letter of September 23, with reference to the
                            serious situation which has developed in Mexico with respect to corn. He
                            tells me that this is a matter which is more within the field of War
                            Food Administrator Jones than his own, but he will ask Mr. Jones to
                            cooperate with Mr. Bonsal to see what can be done to help Dr. Canedo,
                            President Camacho’s representative, in his efforts to straighten out the
                            corn crisis in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Although the matter of price rests with Economic Stabilization Director
                            Vinson and Food Administrator Jones, Justice Byrnes states that you
                            should not minimize the actual shortage of corn in this country and that
                            the situation is by no means caused simply because of dissatisfaction
                            with the price ceilings. It is true that corn has not flown as freely to
                            market as it might because of the existing hog-corn price ratio, but it
                            is also true that there is a very small supply to meet existing
                            demands.</p>

                        <p>As you know, the President issued a directive, of which I enclose a

                            need. This matter is being very actively explored, and Commodity Credit
                            is endeavoring to locate corn elsewhere which might be used to replace
                            any that might be taken from our own stocks or which might be made
                            available to the Mexicans on an immediate basis.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the degree of difficulty involved in a matter of obtaining
                            this corn for Mexico is exceedingly great, as you will undoubtedly <pb

                        <p>1734. At a meeting this afternoon the Commodity Credit advised Ambassador
                            del Rio<note n="55" xml:id="d381fn55">Francisco del Rio Canedo.</note>
                            that there would be made available to Mexico, as a stopgap, 5,000 tons
                            of corn at Kansas City and St. Louis to be shipped in accordance with
                            del Rio’s instructions i.e., 2,500 for shipment by sea from New Orleans
                            originating at St. Louis at $1.0875 and 2,500 tons for rail shipment
                            originating at Kansas City at $1.0475. In exchange, del Rio promised
                            that his Government would do everything possible to deliver at border
                            points from El Paso west vegetable meal on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
                            Commodity Credit then stated that the vegetable meal prices should be
                            per short ton, cottonseed meal, $42 bulk and $45 bag; flax seed meal $38
                            bulk and $41 bag; sesame meal $44 bulk and $47 bag. Commodity Credit
                            pointed out that the two first were based on ceiling prices while the
                            sesame is based on a “fair price”, there being no ceiling. It was
                            pointed out to del Rio that the degree of success of the Mexican efforts
                            to obtain this vegetable meal for grain feed for cattle in the west
                            would be an important factor in Commodity Credit’s ability to get other
                            corn from the back country as the 5,000 tons now being made available
                            are all that Commodity Credit can now afford. In other words, subject to
                            transportation limitations in the movement of corn, Commodity Credit
                            will continue to make corn available in the dollar equivalent amount of
                            vegetable meal delivered at points west of El Paso.</p>
                        <p>It was also emphasized that the transportation factor was of the utmost
                            importance and that it would be necessary to move the box cars back out
                            of Mexico on an extremely urgent basis.</p>
                        <p>Del Rio indicated that he would have C. B. Fox and Company, New Orleans,
                            telephone Commodity Credit immediately regarding the final arrangements
                            for the corn.</p>
                        <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0452"/>
                        <p>It will be noted that Commodity Credit is accepting, in exchange for this
                            corn, the promise of del Rio his Government would do everything possible
                            to make the vegetable meal available.</p>
                        <p>Del Rio will presumably report back to his President immediately and this
                            information is furnished you for your background only.</p>
                        <p>The Department desires also to point out that the action of Commodity
                            Credit in obtaining this promise from del Rio is for the purpose of
                            defending its making this corn available to Mexico, Corn is in urgent
                            demand throughout the west particularly for dairy and poultry use and
                            there would otherwise be marked criticism levied against this
                            action.</p>
                        <p>The Department will appreciate your views as to the probable success of
                            this arrangement as a solution of Mexico’s current corn problem.</p>

                        <p>1823. Ambassador del Rio has informed the Department that he is
                            completing arrangements for the purchase of 4,000 tons of corn on open
                            market at the ceiling price deliverable after November 1 at Saint Louis,
                            Kansas City, or other markets. It appears, on investigation, that this
                            transaction is in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. A
                            severe shortage continues to exist as far as corn for feed purposes is
                            concerned. It is anticipated that, owing to the growing shortage of
                            feed, it will be necessary to ration restrictively milk and eggs.</p>
                        <p>Whether Mexico gets corn from Commodity Credit or through commercial
                            channels the amount received will depend primarily upon the willingness
                            of the appropriate agencies of this Government to allow corn to move to
                            Mexico. In turn, that willingness will depend upon the willingness and
                            ability of the Mexican Government to make substitute feeds available for
                            distribution in this country in accordance with the directives of the
                            pertinent agencies of this Government. Dr. del Rio has not yet furnished
                            any concrete information on this point although he yesterday informed
                            the Department that he would have such information on Wednesday or
                            Thursday of this week. In the absence of such concrete information and
                            in view of the statements as to the availability of these substitute
                            feed products contained in your despatch no. 13722 of October 20,<note

                            that no further progress can be made towards the release of Government
                            owned or controlled corn until we have the required information from the
                            Mexican <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0453"/>Government.
                            Furthermore, the appropriate agencies of this Government will obviously
                            not be in a position to permit further exports through commercial
                            channels on an unlimited scale in the absence of definite Mexican
                            cooperation.</p>
                        <p>The reason for specifying delivery of Mexican oil seed cakes or meal at
                            El Paso or points west is that there is a deficiency of <hi

                            areas.</p>
                        <p>With respect to your inquiry as to whether the Mexicans have obtained
                            corn elsewhere, the Department knows of no arrangements whereby the
                            Mexicans have recently obtained corn other than the above operation and
                            other than the two Government-to-Government operations of which you have

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to previous
                            correspondence with the Department concerning the general authority of
                            the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs to carry through emergency
                            food programs in various of the American republics.</p>
                        <p>It will be recalled that the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs<note
                                n="57" xml:id="d383fn57">Nelson Rockefeller.</note> has on several
                            occasions during the last year expressed a desire that the Embassy
                            initiate conversations with the Mexican Government leading towards the
                            inauguration of such a program. The Department is aware that the
                            attitude of this Embassy has consistently been that the existing
                            circumstances in Mexico did not warrant our taking up this matter with
                            the Mexican Government and that there were various reasons of policy why
                            it should not be taken up with the Mexican Government at the time. …</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The Department will note that my attitude towards the eventual
                            presentation of this matter to the Mexican authorities has changed and
                            that under certain conditions I am willing to undertake the negotiation
                            of such an agreement with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The
                            principal reason for this change of attitude of the Embassy is that the
                            derangement in the food problems of Mexico brought about by the
                            diversion of corn lands to oil seeds and other more profitable crops has
                            resulted in a very serious corn shortage. The methods <pb n="440"
                                xml:id="pg_440" facs="0454"/>of producing corn in Mexico which is
                            the basic food in the country, in spite of the efforts of the Department
                            of Agriculture to bring about an improvement, have not been successful
                            in bringing about any reasonable production of corn per acre. There are
                            many factors which enter into this problem. It is increasingly
                            necessary, in view of the fact that corn is the basic food of the
                            Mexican people, that something be done to improve the production of corn
                            per acre. The same applies to several other of the basic crops of the
                            country. If, through a collaborative program such as the Coordinator has
                            in mind, we can be of real assistance to Mexico in improving the per
                            acre production of her basic crops, it will be a great service to the
                            country. The degree to which we are able to do this is not yet clear to
                            me but I have changed my point of view in the sense that I believe that
                            the Mexican authorities will be somewhat more receptive towards an
                            approach of this kind.</p>

                        <p>Further reference is made to the memorandum of September 1, 1943, from
                            the Mexican Embassy,<note n="58" xml:id="d384fn58">Not printed.</note>
                            concerning the shipment to Mexico of about two million bushels of wheat
                            purchased in this country and requesting that, since it will not be
                            possible to ship the two million bushels to Mexico before January 31,
                            1944, the subsidy arrangement be extended to January 31 of next
                            year.</p>
                        <p>A further communication on this matter has now been received from the
                            Acting Secretary of Agriculture<note n="59" xml:id="d384fn59">Paul H.
                                Appleby; letter of October 25, 1943, not printed.</note> stating
                            that the period for delivery under the subsidy program has been extended
                            from October 31 to December 31, 1943. The Acting Secretary of
                            Agriculture expresses the view that the extension of time should be
                            quite ample to take care of remaining stocks in the United States,
                            particularly if the Mexican Government is taking steps, as has been
                            indicated to the Department of Agriculture, to increase the current
                            volume of wheat imports into Mexico.</p>

                        <p>The above met in Mr. Bonsal’s office the afternoon of Friday,
                            October 29, 1943.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador del Rio opened the conversation by stating that, while he had
                            received replies from his Government, the information received gave no
                            indication as to what immediate shipment of protein meal might be made,
                            but that he understood 100,000 tons would eventually become available.
                            He did not have any information as to whether the prices fixed by
                            Commodity Credit nor as to how much meal, at these prices, would be
                            immediately available. He referred to a telegram from Distribuidora
                            indicating Mexico would be glad to collaborate.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Note</hi> 1: Del Rio had confirmation from his
                            Government of agreement in principle to collaborate with our Government
                            on protein meal. He had nothing on prices and amounts immediately
                            available. I gathered he intended to make the latter data available as
                            soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>Dr. del Rio then inquired as to whether corn in the open market were not
                            moving faster. He said that American Trading and Continental Grain had
                            offered to deliver him all the corn he needed after November 15. He
                            emphasized, however, that while his country was in vital need of corn,
                            his Government would not deal with these companies except on a legal
                            basis and with the full sanction and approval of our Government. He
                            asked if his Government might deal directly with these companies on the
                            open market.</p>
                        <p>It was inquired how much corn was involved. The Ambassador said 150,000
                            tons to be deliverable after the 15th of November. The Ambassador
                            inquired if Commodity Credit had any comments to offer on the firm
                            assertion of the companies they could deliver. The Commodity Credit
                            representatives said that as yet they were unable to forecast the
                            answer, but that the two companies under reference were very large and
                            reliable firms indeed.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said that with respect to his inquiry as to the
                            propriety of these open market operations, he wished to point out that
                            this was a matter entirely distinct from the protein meals, <pb n="442"
                                xml:id="pg_442" facs="0456"/>since he was going to see that,
                            entirely apart from the corn—where and how it were obtained, and in what
                            amounts—, the protein meals were made available to this country; that
                            Mexico would be glad to sell them; and that he would be glad to see they
                            were distributed in accordance with Commodity Credit’s instructions or
                            desires.</p>
                        <p>He reverted to his inquiry as to the propriety of these private, open
                            market operations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Farrington said that the following formula would be approvable:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">As of today it would be all right for the Government of
                                Mexico to buy corn privately, subject to</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                                >a</hi>) <hi rend="italic">maintenance of ceiling prices and</hi>
                                (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) <hi rend="italic">obtention of an export
                                license.</hi></p>
                        <p>Ambassador del Rio said his Government of course planned to abide by the
                            ceiling prices, as it did not contemplate following other than the
                            strict letter of the law. In so far as the export licenses were
                            concerned, it was pointed out that Mr. Fox had had no difficulty in
                            obtaining these, and Mr. Carrigan suggested “that, in principle and at
                            this time, there was no reason to expect any difficulty if the amounts
                            involved were reasonable and did not upset our market”. The Ambassador
                            pointed out that we would hardly refuse such licenses to Mexico, and
                            that the 150,000 tons would be purchased over a 12-month period. Mr.
                            Carrigan remarked that these licenses were not issued by the Department
                            of State, but that he agreed in principle with the Ambassador. It was
                            then further remarked that the situation might change and that it might
                            even be that corn came under rationing here. The Ambassador replied
                            that, if such a changed situation should arise, he was sure we would
                            wish to share with Mexico on an equitable basis what we might have.</p>
                        <p>Reference was then made to the 48,000 bushels remaining, in Kansas City,
                            of the 5,000 tons released by Commodity Credit. The Ambassador said that
                            this had not yet started to move. Mr. Fox said that there had apparently
                            been some misunderstanding but that the warehouse receipts should have
                            arrived that same day, and said he felt satisfied the corn would start
                            moving November 1, Monday. Mr. Carrigan asked if the Ambassador and Mr.
                            Fox were certain we need take no action: he was informed no action then
                            seemed necessary.</p>

                            lifting the embargo and he promised to take up this matter with the
                            President. This morning he informed the Agricultural Attaché that the
                            subject had been taken up and that the embargo had been placed in effect
                            by Economic [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] in the belief that it was so
                            desired by the American Government on information furnished by the
                            Mexican Embassy in Washington and also in the belief that it was a type
                            of barter arrangement such that the oilseed meals would be purchased by
                            an agency of the American Government. The Minister asked if the American
                            Government would accept as evidence of its cooperation quantities of
                            oilseed meals shipped to the U. S. through the usual channels of trade.
                            The Agricultural Attaché informed the Minister that he believed such an
                            arrangement would be satisfactory but that he would make appropriate
                            inquiries. The Minister stated he wished a reply in writing. This
                            Embassy is fully convinced that only by opening up the usual channels of
                            trade can oilseed meals be moved quickly and advantageously, otherwise
                            the whole matter will become hopelessly involved within the
                            administration machinery of the Mexican Government. We estimate that
                            between 40,000 and 50,000 tons have already been sold to American
                            buyers. This Embassy would appreciate immediate telegraphic reply
                            concerning this question.</p>
                        <p>In a speech yesterday the Minister of Agriculture announced the size of
                            the new corn crop at 1,775,000 metric tons involving a probable deficit
                            of 475,000 tons. He indicated that 18,000 tons are authorized for
                            purchase abroad and hoped that new Government measures would stimulate
                            production enough next spring to cover the balance of deficit.</p>
                        <p>Today and confidentially the Minister of Agriculture informed the
                            Agricultural Attaché that 20,000 to 25,000 tons comprise immediate needs
                            with possibility of additional 75,000 to 100,000 tons being required
                            next spring. The Minister stated that the problem was equally one of
                            assurance in being able to get physical delivery and transportation of
                            corn as much as corn itself. The Department is requested to inform this
                            Embassy whether such assurance can be furnished the <pb n="444"
                                xml:id="pg_444" facs="0458"/>Mexican Government even though the corn
                            may not be required. It is believed such assurance will go far towards
                            reducing the probable actual amount of corn required by Mexico.</p>

                        <p>1932. The best information available to the Department regarding the corn
                            for Mexico is as follows:</p>
                        <p>From United States Government sources about 6,500 tons; from other
                            sources in the United States, about 18,000 tons (of which 12,000 tons is
                            said to have been acquired by Ambassador Del Rio although full details
                            are not available.) In addition, 1900 tons is available from Cuba of
                            which 500 have already been shipped with an additional 1500 tons
                            expected to be available shortly. The Department and other agencies at
                            Washington will continue to cooperate to expedite shipments.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Mexican oilseed meal exports, the interested agencies of
                            this Government would like to see these products move rapidly through
                            normal commercial channels at the price levels which were indicated to
                            you. You are authorized to furnish this information in writing to the
                            Minister of Agriculture as suggested in your telegram 1086, November 8,
                            4 p.m., and to add that quantities of oilseed meals shipped to the
                            United States under these conditions would be welcomed as evidence of
                            the Mexican Government’s cooperation provided that Mexico will similarly
                            accept all corn shipped from this country either through Government or
                            commercial channels.</p>
                        <p>Although the Department believes that the setting off of amounts of corn
                            furnished from the United States as against the amounts of oilseed meal
                            furnished by Mexico serves a useful purpose, it is the Department’s
                            position that an exact equivalence can not at all times be obtained, and
                            the Department believes it to the advantage of both Governments to
                            extend to each other a maximum of cooperation.</p>

                        <p>In confirmation of the conversations which its representatives have been
                            holding with those of the Department of State, the Embassy of <pb
                                n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0459"/>Mexico desires to refer to
                            arrangements initiated by its Government for the purchase of a tonnage
                            of corn which would permit the solution of the scarcity which has
                            resulted from the very bad climatic conditions of the year which is
                            ending. In this connection, the Department will recall that the United
                            States authorities directed these arrangements toward the idea of an
                            exchange of corn for oil seed meals that United States farmers in the
                            Middle West and in the West might use in place of the corn sold to
                            Mexico and which, in the United States, is fundamentally used for
                            livestock feed purposes.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Mexico has been particularly well disposed toward
                            establishing an agricultural policy resulting in the production of the
                            two countries—Mexico and the United States—being complementary. With
                            this in view, Mexico has been exporting considerable tonnages of oil
                            seed meals and the exportations this year will increase even more
                            because of a production considerably over that of last year.</p>
                        <p>The proposal that meals should be delivered directly in exchange for corn
                            appears to present this matter in the disagreeable light of a bartering
                            of merchandise. Mexico, in fact, is sending to the United States large
                            quantities of agricultural products and, through a very intense campaign
                            for increased sowing, is preparing to meet her deficit of corn without
                            having to call upon the help of United States production.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the problem of oil seed meals, Mexico has endeavored to
                            overcome the shortage by permitting a liberal increase in prices. To
                            wish to obtain from Mexico oil seed meals at the United States ceiling
                            prices would complicate the situation of Mexico and that of the United
                            States, for it would diminish interest in production in Mexico without
                            the United States obtaining a result other than that of not being able
                            to obtain those meals now being acquired from Mexico.</p>
                        <p>There are United States purchasers who are endeavoring to acquire Mexican
                            meals at reasonable prices. Mexico cannot begin requiring sales at low
                            prices without upsetting her own problem of oil seed sowing.</p>
                        <p>The above situation was fully gone into last Friday by the Secretary of
                            Agriculture and the Ambassador of the United States, Mr. Messersmith.
                            Ambassador Messersmith, who is adequately informed regarding the
                            agricultural efforts of Mexico, not only shared the views of Engineer
                            Gómez, but even showed himself disconcerted by the embargo decreed by
                            the Ministry of National Economy and considered this embargo susceptible
                            of hindering the efforts that he has been making to obtain corn for
                            Mexico.</p>
                        <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0460"/>
                        <p>Ambassador Messersmith requested Engineer Gómez to use his influence to
                            the end that the Ministry of National Economy should lift the embargo,
                            and strongly recommended that commercial operations between Mexico and
                            the United States continue to be carried out through the accustomed
                            commercial channels.</p>
                        <p>In the opinion of the Embassy, this request involves the idea that the
                            Government of the United States of America shall take into account any
                            exportation of oil seed meals from Mexico to the United States through
                            already established commercial channels as a contribution toward easing
                            the United States problem of cattle feed. Furthermore, the Embassy is
                            sure that, upon returning to a normal system insofar as these exports
                            are concerned, the Government of the United States of America will
                            continue its efforts to cooperate with the Government of Mexico in
                            solving those problems brought about by the present scarcity of corn
                            through direct deliveries of this cereal to the Government of
                            Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Since confirmation by the Department of State of the ideas expressed in
                            the previous paragraph would speed up those steps which are necessary
                            for the lifting of the embargo under reference, the Embassy has to
                            request that the Department be so kind as to furnish its reply to this
                            Memorandum within the shortest period possible.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Leon</hi>: I have to refer to your letter of
                            November 8, 1943,<note n="61" xml:id="d389fn61">Not printed.</note>
                            regarding the question of lifting the present embargo on vegetable oil
                            cakes and meals.</p>
                        <p>As your office has been advised by Mr. Carrigan, certain steps have been
                            taken by our Embassy in Mexico City regarding this matter, and our
                            Embassy was assured yesterday that a telegram would go out lifting the
                            embargo along the border. The Embassy was not certain as of this
                            afternoon as to whether these measures would affect future shipments or
                            whether the embargo was merely being lifted on shipments which might be
                            pending. In any event, as you know, the Mexicans appear very desirous to
                            take early action along the same general lines that you mention in your
                            letter.</p>
                        <p>I had lunch with Ambassador Castillo Nájera today and discussed your
                            letter with him. Along broad lines, as you know, your letter <pb n="447"
                                xml:id="pg_447" facs="0461"/>follows more or less the proposals made
                            by the Mexicans in the note they delivered yesterday<note n="62"
                                xml:id="d389fn62"><hi rend="italic">Supra.</hi></note> and a copy of
                            which has been sent to you.</p>
                        <p>I explained at some length to Ambassador Castillo Nájera the
                            interpretation you gave Mr. Carrigan this morning as to the prices set
                            for these oilcakes and meals, that is, that these prices were merely to
                            be considered as measuring rods for the purpose of determining whether
                            corn shipments to Mexico were lagging behind meal and cake shipments
                            from Mexico, or whether the case were the reverse. I explained to him
                            that these prices were not intended to govern in the case of the present
                            pending transactions but that we would of course expect the help of the
                            Mexican Government should, at some future date, the prices charged our
                            people for these meals and cakes become excessive. I explained to him
                            that this was really a very difficult situation, inasmuch as in many
                            ways it might be said that our farmers could use this corn at the
                            ceiling prices instead of vegetable meals and cakes. If the prices for
                            these meals and cakes became excessive, our farmers would naturally
                            prefer to use corn at our ceiling prices for cattle feed.</p>
                        <p>According to the best information available, Dr. del Rio was able to
                            obtain some corn on the private markets deliverable after November 1. A
                            pooling of this information appears to show that Cargill<note n="63"
                                xml:id="d389fn63">Cargill, Inc., Minneapolis, dealers in
                                grain.</note> has definitely sold him between five and six thousand
                            tons; and that Fox in New Orleans has definitely sold him roughly six
                            thousand tons. He is also said to have obtained a further five or six
                            thousand tons, probably from Continental,<note n="64" xml:id="d389fn64"
                                >Continental Grain Company of Kansas.</note> but this has not been
                            confirmed. Also, I understand Commodity Credit is making some 1,400 tons
                            available from Cuba. This is, of course, a very satisfactory improvement
                            on a situation which was really the source of very deep concern. I hope
                            they will be able to make substantial further purchases on the open
                            market, and I hope your information tallies with what we have heard, to
                            the effect that there is quite a substantial additional amount they
                            might obtain. It would be exceedingly helpful to us and to our Embassy
                            in Mexico if we might have at an early date some general information as
                            to their further prospects, as well as the specific information on their
                            current shipments which I understand you are getting together: I shall
                            certainly appreciate these data when they are available.</p>
                        <p>The situation with respect to this corn does seem to be shaping up
                            favorably; however, I am exceedingly grateful for your offer of
                            assistance should the results from private sources not prove as
                            satisfactory as may be necessary to meet the Mexican needs.</p>
                        <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0462"/>
                        <p>I am really very hopeful that a solution satisfactory to all concerned
                            may be found. The immediate problem is of course for us to obtain the
                            vegetable oil meals with a minimum of difficulty and for the Mexicans to
                            obtain adequate corn. I think that lifting the embargo, which, after
                            all, is said to have been established so as to permit these surplus
                            meals to come to us in an orderly fashion, will be most helpful and not
                            difficult of accomplishment. With your assistance, should it prove
                            necessary, I am sure the Mexicans will have their corn.</p>
                        <p>In many ways, however, I wonder if it might not be well, as soon as we
                            see the meal coming in, and if the corn is moving south of the border
                            adequately, to consider suggesting to our Mexican friends that we
                            abandon the “dollar-for-dollar equivalent” project. From the tone of
                            their note, I gather they might be glad to do so, and it might be a wise
                            move on our part since the continuance of the project might at some time
                            in the future lead to an unfortunate recurrence of this meal embargo
                            proposition. You might desire to give some thought to this: I do not
                            think it would be unduly hard to accomplish on the understanding the two
                            Governments would do everything possible to help each other, should
                            purchases of either product fall into difficulties.</p>

                        <p>Reference is made to the Mexican Embassy’s memorandum of November 10,
                            1943, regarding the general question of the scarcity of corn in Mexico
                            and the scarcity of protein meals in the United States of America.</p>
                        <p>Commodity Credit Corporation has informed the Department of State, in
                            this respect, that it will continue to work with the Department in
                            permitting Mexico to secure corn to meet its minimum requirements on the
                            basis of the understanding that the Government of Mexico will in turn
                            facilitate the movement to the United States of oilseed meals in an
                            equivalent value in order to provide livestock feed.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that, recently, shipments of these oilseed meals may
                            have been purchased in Mexico by dealers from countries other than the
                            United States of America.</p>
                        <p>The food situation in the United States continues to be very serious, and
                            Commodity Credit, in view of this great need, hopes that dollar values
                            (measured at United States ceiling prices) of protein feed <pb n="449"
                                xml:id="pg_449" facs="0463"/>from Mexico shall at least match the
                            dollar values (also at United States ceiling prices) of corn shipped to
                            Mexico.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the question of the prices commanded by oilseed meals
                            shipped to the United States for livestock feed, the appropriate
                            authorities of the Government of the United States would only desire to
                            take effective measures for the control of such prices after the arrival
                            of oilseed meal shipments in the United States.</p>
                        <p>With particular reference to the Embassy’s inquiry as to whether oilseed
                            meal shipped through usual commercial channels shall be taken into
                            account for the purposes indicated in the fourth paragraph hereof, and
                            with reference to the suggested use of October 15, 1943, as the date
                            from which shipments of either corn or meal shall be taken into such
                            account, Commodity Credit finds it entirely acceptable to take into
                            account shipments of either corn or meal made through either the usual
                            commercial channels or through such other channels as may have been
                            necessary starting October 15, 1943.</p>
                        <p>In the premises, in so far as shipments of oilseed meal to the United
                            States may be concerned, it is trusted that the embargo on such
                            shipments, placed thereon by the Government of Mexico, may not be
                            reapplied, and that there may be taken any appropriate steps to
                            facilitate the passage into normal United States commercial channels of
                            any surplus of Mexican oilseed meal.</p>

                            interests in the Mexican petroleum industry, and referred to the

                            this matter. I indicated to him that although I had on several occasions
                            referred to my desire to discuss this matter in detail with the
                            President and with Padilla, I had been told by Padilla that he was
                            giving careful study to the memorandum and would discuss it with me in
                            due course.</p>
                        <p>After the conversation with Duggan, I informed Señor Padilla that I
                            wished to discuss this matter with him fully and I have had two talks
                            with him during the first part of this week. He did not show any
                            considerable disposition to discuss the questions involved, but rather
                            wished to explore our own views. He indicated that so far as their
                            studies had gone, they did not see the possibility of the participation
                            of foreign, and of course American, capital, except in the foreign
                            marketing of Mexican oil. I told him that this would, I believed, be an
                            altogether inadequate basis for discussion, as it would not be of
                            sufficient interest to my Government and of no interest to the foreign
                            oil interests whose cooperation in any marketing scheme was essential. I
                            called his attention to the fact that while in Mexico and in Russia the
                            oil industry may be a Government monopoly, the major oil producing
                            interests in the world are private companies which to a large extent
                            control the world markets.</p>
                        <p>There are reasons why I wish to get this letter off by this air mail this
                            morning, so that I cannot enter into a discussion of the conversations I
                            had with Padilla at this time. This is just a word to tell you that I
                            find, through my discussions with him and Mr. Suárez,<note n="70"
                                xml:id="d391fn70">Eduardo Suárez, Mexican Minister of
                                Finance.</note> that the Mexican study of our memorandum has not
                            made the progress which, in my opinion, it should have made, and that
                            they have not yet adequately attacked the basic problems of policy which
                            they must face. While I cannot go into details, I can only say here that
                            I discussed fully with Padilla the various points raised in our
                            memorandum and I finally secured from him a statement to the effect that
                            he realized that the Mexican Government would have to consider these
                            major questions of policy and he would go into them again immediately
                            with his associates and with the President and would talk with me before
                            he left on a holiday which he is taking and with the President, so that
                            I could talk with the President before I left on a brief leave for
                            Washington on January 15th. Padilla indicated that he realized that a
                            certain participation on an equitable basis by foreign capital in the
                            Mexican industry was necessary. In a conversation with Suárez, he
                            indicated to me that he believed foreign participation in a certain
                            measure and on an equitable basis was necessary. The only forward
                            progress which I have made in the conversations is that I think they are
                            now actually <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0465"/>studying the
                            method under which foreign capital can on an acceptable basis to both
                            sides participate in the industry. One thing is clear, and that is that
                            the internal marketing is closed to foreign capital, so far as
                            distribution and sale of oil products in Mexico is concerned. Another
                            thing which is clear is that the oil industry will remain a monopoly of
                            the government in Mexico, and that the principle of subsoil rights,
                            etc., will be maintained. As I see it, their approach will be to
                            determine in what measure and in what form foreign capital can
                            participate with Petroleos Mexicanos<note n="71" xml:id="d391fn71"
                                >Mexican Government instrumentality referred to as “Pemex”.</note>
                            and with the Mexican Government in phases of the oil industry other than
                            the internal marketing in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>The reason I am writing you this letter so hurriedly is because Pauley
                            and a man named Mosher<note n="72" xml:id="d391fn72">Edwin W. Pauley,

                            people in the Government. Pauley came in to see me with Mosher
                            yesterday. He knows all about the deGolyer report,<note n="73"
                                xml:id="d391fn73">Not printed; the report (made by a mission headed
                                by Everette L. DeGolyer, Assistant Deputy Petroleum Administrator)
                                recommended a rehabilitation of the refineries of Pemex and the
                                construction of a high octane plant in Mexico City
                                (812.6363/7801).</note> and far more than I know here. I told him
                            that I had been given some partial information with regard to the
                            deGolyer report and that I was authorized to make a communication to the
                            Mexican Government with regard to certain materials for repairs to the
                            refineries and to increasing the capacity of the Mexico City refinery;
                            and that we were prepared to consider the possibilities of a high-octane
                            plant in Mexico City, but this latter was a more difficult problem on
                            account of the considerable amount of new material involved. I said that
                            I was communicating with the Mexican Government in this sense and
                            indicating that conversations as to the details would have to be between
                            the Department of State and members of the Mexican Government designated
                            for this purpose. Pauley asked where he came in under this, and I told
                            him that I believed our conversations with regard to the deGolyer report
                            and with regard to the oil question, so far as rehabilitation is
                            concerned, had been on the basis of what had to be done and without any
                            reference to companies. I emphasized that the conversations with regard
                            to repairs and improvement in facilities would be between the State
                            Department and the Mexican Government. Pauley said he had been giving
                            his time and attention to this matter for three years and that he was
                            naturally deeply interested. I told him that so far as I was concerned I
                            was thinking of the matter in terms of what had to be done and not in
                            terms of his interest or any other individual interest. <pb n="452"
                                xml:id="pg_452" facs="0466"/>He said he quite understood and he was
                            going home on Saturday. He will undoubtedly come down on the Department
                            and other agencies almost at once.</p>
                        <p>I saw Mr. Suárez and we had a very frank talk about Pauley’s being here
                            and Suárez told me that he would tell Pauley that so far as the Mexican
                            Government is concerned these conversations had to be with the
                            Department of State on this matter and they were not prepared to talk to
                            any individuals.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>I am so tremendously pressed here that it may be several days before I
                            can find an opportunity to dictate a full report on my conversations on
                            oil with Padilla and Suárez, but I will try to get it off as soon as
                            possible. This is just a preliminary word to give you a somewhat
                            inadequate idea of what has developed, so that you may be aware of
                            Pauley’s presence here, etc.</p>

                            <p>Some months ago, in accord with an arrangement between the Government
                                of the United Mexican States and that of the United States of
                                America, a joint mission of experts of the two Governments made a
                                survey of the petroleum situation in Mexico with particular
                                reference to the needs of the petroleum industry for materials for
                                repairs and improvements. This mission has now made its report to
                                the Department of State and the Department has endorsed and approved
                                the recommendations of the mission on repair and expansion equipment
                                and materials which, in the opinion of the mission, are needed by
                                the oil refineries in Mexico. It has approved as well, in principle,
                                recommendations with respect to some new plant construction and
                                facilities to increase the facilities of existing plants. The
                                necessary priority allocations will be facilitated by the Government
                                of the United States towards this end.</p>
                            <p>The Department of State assumes that the Government of Mexico will
                                discuss with the Government of the United States the question of
                                obtaining competent American manufacturers, well-grounded in this
                                particular category of work, to design and erect the equipment, and
                                if necessary to train the operators thereof, in this manner assuring
                                efficiency in the use of the machinery and equipment for which
                                priorities will be sought.</p>
                            <p>While the American Embassy in Mexico City has not received full
                                information concerning the contents of the report and
                                recommendations of the petroleum mission, it is in a position to
                                convey the following information with respect to the report, to the
                                Government of the United Mexican States: <list>

                                    <item>Producing operations currently require only maintenance
                                        and operating materials, but an expanded program of
                                        exploration drilling must be undertaken very soon to
                                        strengthen the fast-deteriorating reserve position. This is
                                        a very considerable undertaking and one which will require
                                        careful study.</item>

                                    <item>The refineries further urgently require both maintenance
                                        and expansion materials in order to continue current
                                        operations and to fulfill the requirements which may arise
                                        out of the war emergency. The most important steps in the

                                        gasoline in the amount of approximately one thousand barrels

                                        arrange for the construction of these new units by

                            <p>The Department of State has instructed the Embassy of the United
                                States in Mexico City, in transmitting the above-summarized portions
                                of the oil mission’s report, to suggest that the appropriate Mexican
                                authorities will wish to review these and in due course send
                                appropriate representatives to the United States for discussions
                                with the Department of State of their proposed arrangements for the
                                prosecution of the work and as regards manufacturers and
                                contractors.</p>
                            <p>While the discussions of the Mexican representatives will be with the
                                Department of State, it is noted that when it will be helpful to
                                have the aid of other United States Government agencies, the
                                Department of State will arrange therefor.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States expresses the desire that the
                                negotiations and conversations regarding the erection and management
                                of the proposed 100-octane gasoline plant under consideration be
                                carried on between Mexican and United States Government
                                representatives. The interested departments of the United States
                                Government in Washington, with this in mind, are already in
                                consultation and will in the very near future be prepared to consult
                                with the appropriate Mexican officials.</p>

                                to President Roosevelt a statement (812.6363/7802) of the opposition
                                of the Department to the building of a high octane gasoline plant by
                                reason of the scarcity of equipment, and of its disapproval of the
                                plan of E. W. Pauley to build such a plant because it suggested a
                                type of exploitation which might invite a repetition of earlier
                                difficulties. President Roosevelt on December 7, 1942, directed the
                                Secretary of State to collaborate with the Petroleum Coordinator and
                                the Secretary of Commerce to negotiate an arrangement with Mexico
                                for building the 100-octane aviation gasoline plant

                        <p>I don’t think this high octane gas from Mexico is at all in a difficult
                            situation. Nor do I think that the construction of 100-octane gasoline
                            plant requires decisions in regard to any other oil matters. Surely by
                            now the Mexican Government has the ownership and control of some oil
                            well or oil wells. What is more simple than for the Mexican Government
                            to buy at cost or to rent the necessary equipment for 100-octane
                            production, to hire somebody to set it up, and to hire some American
                            company’s management to turn out the gasoline?</p>
                        <p>Frankly, I think that on that basis there would not be a single voice
                            raised in Mexico against that kind of deal. The octane gasoline desired
                            is solely for war purposes. The United Nations need it. They ought to
                            have it.</p>
                        <p>I cannot see the relationship between this immediate need and the
                            “clarification of general petroleum policy”. I don’t agree either with
                            you or Mr. Ickes<note n="77" xml:id="d393fn77">Harold L. Ickes,

                            acknowledge the receipt of your note number 1027 of February 15,
                                1943,<note n="79" xml:id="d394fn79">Not found in Department
                                files.</note> regarding the acquisition of gasoline in Mexican towns
                            on our northern border by the <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0470"
                            />owners of automobiles with licenses issued in the United States of
                            America.</p>
                        <p>The Ministry has learned that among the various problems raised in this
                            connection, the Government of the United States regards as particularly
                            important (1) the evasions which, by such sales, are committed against
                            the American gasoline rationing regulations, whose primary object is to
                            conserve rubber, and (2) the export of gasoline from the United States
                            to certain Mexican frontier towns.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I wish to inform you that in this matter, as in all others
                            which have arisen in the present emergency, the Government of Mexico is
                            moved by the deepest desire to cooperate with the United States.
                            However, I believe that the concrete solution proposed by you—that, in
                            said Mexican towns, owners of automobiles with American license-plates
                            be required to turn over their American ration coupons—aside from the
                            fact that it is legally impossible, in practice would offer no means of
                            effective control.</p>
                        <p>In this respect, the Ministry believes that the rationing system, through
                            coupons, is efficacious when there are no exceptions to its enforcement,
                            for only in that way is it feasible to exercise due vigilance over the
                            stores of the rationed article, and, in consequence, to punish every
                            infringement of the respective regulations. When, as in the case in
                            point, it is a question of limiting the consumption of gasoline to only
                            one section of the public—American motorists in Mexican frontier
                            towns—many ways would be found of evading the regulations; wherefore I
                            think an effort should be made to find other means of action.</p>
                        <p>As regards the problem of the infringement of the said American rationing
                            regulations, I am of the opinion that it could be resolved by limiting
                            the importation of gasoline by American automobiles returning to the
                            United States to an amount equal to or less than that carried at the
                            time of entry onto Mexican territory.</p>
                        <p>In assuring you that in a program of this kind the American authorities
                            may depend upon the full collaboration of those of my country, I avail
                            myself of the opportunity to renew the assurances of my high
                            consideration.</p>

                            anticipated that the representatives of the Mexican Government will
                            arrive in Washington within the next few days.</p>
                        <p>The Department, in agreement with the Petroleum Administrator for War,
                            envisages a contract between the Mexican Government’s petroleum
                                organization<note n="82" xml:id="d395fn82">Petroleos
                                Mexicanos.</note> and an American concern of recognized standing,
                            experienced in the design and operation of similar refining plants.
                            Financing can presumably be arranged through the Export-Import Bank. The
                            entire project, from the technical point of view, will have the benefit
                            of review by the Petroleum Administrator and also by the War and Navy
                            Departments to ensure a maximum correlation with military requirements.
                            The contract will presumably include a clause giving this Government
                            control over the marketing of the exportable surplus of products to be
                            produced by the new plant during the life of the financing.</p>
                        <p>As soon as full agreement has been reached with the Mexican Government,
                            it will undoubtedly be necessary for you to send a directive to the War
                            Production Board in order to ensure the prompt scheduling of the
                            necessary materials for the construction of the proposed plant. As you
                            are aware, these materials are in extremely short supply and, if the
                            commitment which we plan to make to the Mexicans is to be promptly and
                            efficiently implemented, there is no doubt that an expression of your
                            interest in the matter will be imperatively required.</p>

                        <p>The basic explanation given for this inquiry was that “when this

                            must be in position to judge the long-range consequences of its own
                            actions.”</p>
                        <p>The immediate aim of these discussions was “to prepare the way for prompt
                            and effective cooperation between appropriate agencies and individuals
                            of both Governments who are directly concerned in the petroleum aspects
                            of the general accord which exists between these two nations.”</p>
                        <p>Your several telegrams and despatches relating to your discussions with
                            the President and other Government officials, as well as your recent
                            oral reports in Washington, all indicate the probable necessity and even
                            the possible desire on the part of the Mexican Government for some
                            informal suggestions from this Government which might assist the Mexican
                            officials in crystallizing their own ideas in a form which would suit
                            our mutual purposes.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of my call on the Secretary of the Interior was to secure his
                            approval of the press release which it is desired to issue in connection
                            with the arrangements which have so far been agreed to for the
                            construction of the 100 octane gasoline plant in Mexico. (Text
                                attached<note n="87" xml:id="d398fn87">Not printed.</note>). The
                            desirability of such clearance had been indicated to me by Mr.
                            Welles.</p>
                        <p>I began the interview by pointing out to Mr. Ickes that Señor Buenrostro
                            of Petroleos Mexicanos had now been in the United States over six weeks,
                            and that he was most anxious, for a variety of obvious reasons, to have
                            some statement issued regarding the results achieved in his discussions
                            in Washington. I added that when Mr. Welles and myself were in Mexico
                            last week, both the Mexican Foreign Minister and Ambassador Messersmith
                            had similarly indicated the desirability of a statement of this kind. I
                            also referred in passing to the fact that of course the general nature
                            of Señor Buenrostro’s conversations was known and that it would be
                            helpful to have an authoritative statement on the subject.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ickes then launched into a statement indicating his general
                            dissatisfaction with the way in which these discussions have been
                            handled. He said that the Department of State had infringed upon the
                            powers and prerogatives of the Department of the Interior. He referred
                            to <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0475"/>Buenrostro’s selection of
                            the Universal Oil Products Company as consultant, rather implying that
                            someone had put something over on Buenrostro. I asked the Secretary
                            whether he did not agree that Petroleos Mexicanos needed a consultant.
                            He replied in the affirmative. I then told him that Buenrostro had
                            selected Universal Oil Products from a number of available concerns,
                            that Buenrostro was familiar with the ownership and control of Universal
                            Oil Products and that the firm in question had done a good deal of work
                            in Mexico previously. I understood Mr. Ickes to say that he appreciated
                            the high professional standing of Universal Oil Products.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the question of the manner in which the negotiations with
                            the Mexicans had been conducted to date, I said that we in the
                            Department were most anxious for an opportunity of talking this out with
                            the Secretary of the Interior. I stated that I had understood that the
                            plan which had been agreed to between the two Governments and embodied
                            in an exchange of notes, copies of which had been made available to Mr.
                            Ickes, had received Mr. Ickes’ approval in principle. Mr. Ickes then
                            stated that it had been his idea that this Government would build and
                            operate the plant in Mexico. I pointed out to him that this was
                            politically not feasible and I added that there was ample provision in
                            the plan under consideration for the employment by Petroleos Mexicanos
                            of suitable experts and technicians. He then asked me who would pass
                            upon the suitability of these experts. I replied, that I assumed he
                            would. I added that it was, of course, our understanding that all plans
                            and specifications would be submitted to the Petroleum Administrator for
                            War, before any further progress could be made.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ickes then took up the question of Mr. Pauley. He stated that Mr.
                            Thornburg had considerably disturbed some of Mr. Ickes’ people by his
                            insinuations as to this phase of the project. Mr. Ickes expressed the
                            conviction that Mr. Davies<note n="88" xml:id="d398fn88">Ralph K.
                                Davies, Deputy Petroleum Administrator.</note> is not moved by any
                            special interest in Mr. Pauley’s project except in so far as the
                            engineering and other studies made by Mr. Pauley and his organization
                            might be of use in the carrying out of the President’s directive to
                            construct a 100-octane plant in Mexico. The Secretary gave Mr. Davies
                            and Mr. Pauley considerable credit for the initial suggestion upon which
                            this directive was based.</p>
                        <p>I limited myself to the statement that of course when the PAW<note n="89"
                                xml:id="d398fn89">Petroleum Administration for War.</note> had
                            approved the plans and specifications of the plant, Mr. Pauley would be
                            able to bid.</p>
                        <p>I concluded that it seemed to me that the Department of State had now
                            carried out its function and that further progress would depend <pb
                                n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0476"/>on the activities of the
                            Petroleum Administrator for War. I repeated that I hoped it might be
                            possible early next week on Mr. Acheson’s<note n="90" xml:id="d398fn90"
                                >Dean Acheson, Assistant Secretary of State.</note> return, to have
                            a thorough discussion of the situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ickes was obviously very much preoccupied with the coal situation,
                            which he said had just been “dumped in his lap”. He took the proposed
                            press release, said that he would study it and telephone me this
                            afternoon in regard to it. I reported this to Mr. Ickes’ secretary und
                            asked her to do her best to remind him of the matter. Mr. Ickes read the
                            press release but made no specific comment in regard to it.</p>
                        <p>It was quite evident to me, although he was courteous throughout the
                            interview, that he was definitely prejudiced against the Department in
                            this matter. I believe that I was able to clarify a number of points for
                            him. I spoke to him briefly regarding the general oil situation in
                            Mexico and the expressed desire of Señor Buenrostro to “make peace” with
                            the world oil industry and particularly with the American oil industry,
                            without, of course, relinquishing the principle of the nationalization
                            of the Mexican industry.</p>

                                <p>“Hereto is Attached your letter to Mr. Duggan of February 15, in
                                    relation to a prohibition of drilling oil wells under the
                                    direction and supervision of foreign technicians. I discussed
                                    this matter with Minister Gaxiola on May 19 and he said that the
                                    article in question was somewhat misleading. He stated that any
                                    petroleum company operating legally in Mexico could employ
                                    foreign drillers and technicians, provided, it was definitely
                                    established to the satisfaction of the Government that such
                                    employment was not being used as a means of permitting
                                    foreigners to undertake petroleum exploration for their own
                                    account. In other words, it must be shown to the Mexican
                                    Government that the foreign technicians and drillers are
                                    employed exclusively <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0477"
                                    />for the use and benefit of an oil company operating legally in
                                    Mexico and that the foreign drillers and technicians are not
                                    being used as a ruse to gain the entrance of foreigners into the
                                    oil exploration business for their own account. I hope that I
                                    have explained this clearly, but, in ordinary language it means
                                    that the Mexican Government fears that legally operated foreign
                                    oil interests in Mexico might try to secure the entrance of
                                    other foreign interests through the pretext of employing
                                    drillers and technicians for the account of the legal company,
                                    whereas it would be for other purposes. (s) THL.”</p>

                            concerning the visit to Mexico City of Mr. L. H. Nuland, who is the
                            liaison officer of the Petroleum Administration for War to the
                            Department. I have also to refer to my airgram in reply, No. A–1925, of

                        <p>I said that I would be glad to see Mr. Nuland, and talk these matters
                            over with him on his arrival here.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Nuland arrived here several days ago but I was out of the city for
                            the week-end for an absolutely essential rest, and I did not see him
                            until this morning. He explained that he had been in certain countries
                            of Central America with respect to the petroleum pool arrangements.<note
                                n="96" xml:id="d400fn97">For correspondence on the pool arrangements
                                in Costa Rica and El Salvador, see <ref target="#pg_91">pp. 91</ref>
                                ff. and <ref target="#pg_312">pp. 312</ref> ff.,
                                respectively.</note> He referred to at least one shipment of
                            gasoline which had been made by Pemex to Guatemala and one shipment
                            which had been made to Salvador. He said there had been other shipments.
                            The total volume of the gasoline shipped by Pemex to countries of
                            Central America, however, had been very small. The volume, in fact, was
                            not sufficiently important in any way to affect the situation. Mr.
                            Nuland wished to know whether I considered that these shipments of Pemex
                            to the Central American countries had any political significance. I told
                            him that I could see no possible ground for any political significance
                            to such shipments and that I thought from the <pb n="464"
                                xml:id="pg_464" facs="0478"/>political point of view, Mexico was not
                            interested at this time in making shipments of gasoline to the Central
                            American republics. Mr. Nuland said that he was very much interested to
                            know that there were no political implications. I was not quite able to
                            gather what political implications he thought such shipments might have,
                            but they certainly do not have any, and I made this clear to him.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I thought Pemex was not interested in shipping gasoline
                            to the Central American countries at this time. I said that production
                            in Mexico had decreased and consumption had increased so that gasoline
                            was really almost a scarce article here. I said that Mexico might be
                            able to export some heavy fuel oils, but certainly could not export
                            gasoline without injury to herself. There are certain areas in Mexico
                            where gasoline is already short, particularly in agricultural areas, and
                            this is partly a question of short supply and partly of distribution. I
                            said I did not believe that Mexico or Pemex was for the present
                            interested in shipping gasoline outside the country, and that if such
                            shipments had been made, it was probable that they were the result of
                            some special arrangements which had been entered into through some
                            pressures.</p>
                        <p>I asked Mr. Nuland what the problem was in which he was interested, and
                            he said that naturally these shipments from Mexico were disturbing so
                            far as the pool arrangements were concerned. I told him that I could see
                            this, but I gathered from what he said that the shipments had been so
                            small as not really to affect the pool arrangements seriously. He said
                            that this was so. I gathered therefore that it was more a question of
                            principle.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. Nuland that Mexico was not a party to the petroleum pool or to
                            any of these arrangements and that she was of course free to ship
                            petroleum to any destination she saw fit. She had a perfect right to do
                            this, and I did not see how we should endeavor to interfere with it,
                            except that the Mexican Government found that it was to its own
                            advantage not to make such shipments; we were in a position to subtract
                            from the allotments of the countries receiving gasoline from Mexico, any
                            gasoline received from Mexico. I reminded him that even in times of war
                            we and other countries endeavored to maintain normal channels of trade
                            so far as we could, and that every country had a right to endeavor to
                            maintain such normal channels as far as possible, and that other
                            countries had just as much right to do this as we. He agreed that this
                            was so but said that Mexico had not sent gasoline to these countries
                            before.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. Nuland that I thought it would be undesirable to raise this
                            question with the Mexican authorities while he was here. I said that I
                            was sure that the Mexican Government and the Pemex had no interest in
                            shipping gasoline at this time to Central America. I said <pb n="465"
                                xml:id="pg_465" facs="0479"/>that I thought if the matter were
                            brought to the attention of the Mexican Government in the proper way,
                            the appropriate steps would be taken to stop such shipments. I said that
                            the matter could be taken up either by the Department with the Mexican
                            Embassy in Washington or by the Department with this Embassy, so that we
                            could write a note to the Mexican Government and I would deliver it with
                            the appropriate explanations. I thought the latter course was the best
                            one for many reasons, and he agreed. I said that if he would furnish the
                            Department the appropriate information as to shipments which had been
                            made by Pemex to Central American countries and indicate this was
                            disturbing the petroleum pool arrangements which were on the whole
                            advantageous, the Department could then give me the necessary
                            instructions and I would take up the matter with the Foreign Office and
                            I was sure that Pemex would stop airy exportations of gasoline to the
                            other American republics, at least during the war. I reminded him that
                            Mexico was interested in much more major phases of the oil problem so
                            far as we were concerned, than the question of sending a few gallons of
                            gasoline which they themselves needed to Central American [countries],
                            and that Mexico was interested in participating eventually in world
                            distribution of petroleum products and that she would therefore have an
                            understanding of these pool arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Nuland seemed to be thoroughly satisfied with what I told him and
                            said that he would take up the matter with the Department on his return,
                            along the lines indicated in this letter. The matter is really of very
                            secondary importance because the quantity of the shipments has been very
                            small and because I know that the Mexican Government has no interest in
                            shipping gasoline at this time outside the country.</p>
                        <p>I shall be glad to take any steps which the Department thinks
                            appropriate.</p>
                        <p>With all good wishes,</p>
                        <p>Cordially and faithfully yours,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Reference is made to your conversation
                            with Mr. L. H. Nuland, during his recent visit to Mexico City, in regard
                            to shipments of Mexican gasoline to Central America and to your letter
                            of August 31, 1943 to Mr. Joseph F. McGurk in which you suggest a
                            possible approach toward a solution of this matter.</p>
                        <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0480"/>
                        <p>As you state in your letter referred to above, the shipments have been
                            relatively small, particularly in Costa Rica. In Guatemala, however, by
                            June they had reached an amount which represented an increase to the
                            pool allotment of gasoline for Guatemala of 20 percent—which, of course,
                            is considerable. Subsequently, however, arrangements were apparently
                            taken under local rationing systems which brought the price of this
                            excess gasoline down and the imports into Guatemala of Mexican gasoline
                            dropped from 2320 barrels in June to 510 barrels in July, none in August
                            and 381 barrels up to September 23. Therefore, while this continues to
                            have a definite irritation value, the matter is of little importance at
                            present in so far as the quantities of gasoline are concerned.</p>
                        <p>Production figures which have just been given to the Foreign Division of
                            the Petroleum Administration for War by officials, including the export
                            manager, of Pemex indicate that Pemex really has no gasoline production
                            for export, domestic consumption being able to take care of all present
                            production. This would seem to indicate that such shipments as have been
                            sent to Central America, despite this situation, are with an eye to the
                            future. In a recent telegram the Embassy at Guatemala City has advised
                            us that it has learned that Pemex agents at Guatemala City, Peyre and
                            Company, have applied to the War Department there for licenses to erect
                            two 25,000 gallon tanks in Guatemala and have requested licenses for
                            three additional retail outlets. The Embassy stated that the materials
                            for the tanks are being obtained from Mexico, and that if the tanks are
                            installed they will provide fulfillment of one of the Guatemalan
                            conditions for further operations, the other being that the gasoline
                            supplied be of the same octane as that supplied by American
                            distributors.</p>
                        <p>However, the enclosed secret airgram of October 11, 1943 from the Embassy
                            at Guatemala City<note n="97" xml:id="d401fn97">No. A–504, not
                                printed.</note> states that the representative of the Texas Company
                            in Mexico (the representative of that company in Guatemala is a member
                            of the pool committee in that country) has had conversations with Pemex
                            for the purpose of exploring the possibility of the Texas Company’s
                            buying petroleum supplies from Pemex for the Guatemalan market. The
                            airgram points out that the other companies in the Guatemalan pool would
                            be able to obtain supplies from the Texas Company in accordance with
                            pool operating principles; and that the plan, if executed, would
                            constitute a solution of the problem of Mexican supplies to Guatemala.
                            It will be noted that the Embassy states that Pemex’ reaction to the
                            Texas Company’s approach was favorable and there is reason to believe
                            that an arrangement along the lines outlined may be made.</p>
                        <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0481"/>
                        <p>From the viewpoint of the Inter-American Petroleum Supply Pool, the
                            development of all available sources of supply is favored. Moreover,
                            there is now an over-all shortage of gasoline, diesel oil and kerosene
                            in this hemisphere, with increasing war demands for those products. Thus
                            there would be an advantage to the whole supply picture if satisfactory
                            arrangements could be made whereby the Supply Pool could avail itself of
                            Mexican gasoline in supplying a part of the needs in the Central
                            American area.</p>
                        <p>The Pool is for the purpose of effecting an equitable distribution among
                            all participating importing countries of the maximum supplies that can
                            be made available. To accomplish this purpose, all available supplies
                            and supplying facilities must be pooled together. Hence any supplies
                            from Mexico, of course, would have to form a part of the allotments to
                            each country. Otherwise, the Central American countries receiving
                            Mexican oil as additional allotments would have an advantage over other
                            pool countries receiving only regular allotments from present sources.
                            In other words, the benefits to the Pool from any additional supplies
                            from Mexico would have to be spread equitably among all pool importing
                            countries and not accrue only to Central American countries.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, it is believed that a solution beneficial both to the
                            operation of the Pool in the Central American area and to the long-range
                            interests of Mexico might be worked out whereby Mexican gasoline would
                            be sold to the pool companies for distribution by the pool organization
                            in the Central American countries during the life of the Pool. Under the
                            pool arrangement of distributing curtailed products in necessarily
                            restricted markets, the positions of the companies in the markets of the
                            importing countries had to be frozen on the basis of their previous
                            position. For this purpose the trade position in 1941 was taken as the
                            basis of market allocation among supplying companies. The freezing of
                            the companies’ positions in the various markets has, of course, clearly
                            circumscribed their activities from the competitive standpoint. Thus, in
                            this situation, the regular supplying companies cannot help but be
                            disturbed by the entry of Pemex into any importing pool country as a
                            distributor or marketer during the life of the pool arrangement since,
                            because of their cooperation in the Pool, they are not in a position to
                            offer normal competition to a new marketer who would be taking a part of
                            their already curtailed market. The successful operation of the Pool in
                            performing its very important function in this hemisphere rests largely
                            upon the full cooperation which the companies have accorded.</p>
                        <p>As indicated above, from the Mexican point of view a definite advantage
                            might accrue to Pemex from an arrangement whereby the pool organization
                            could avail itself of Mexican gasoline, the <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468"
                                facs="0482"/>distribution and marketing within pool countries being
                            handled by that organization. As you know, this country is changing from
                            an export to an import basis in regard to oil. In the future the
                            Mexicans might be able to make a very satisfactory arrangement with the
                            companies now operating under the Pool whereby the latter would
                            transport and market Mexican oil in various markets. From a long-term
                            viewpoint, therefore, this alternative has a good many very desirable
                            aspects, and it might be useful to consider this with respect to the
                            general rehabilitation of the Mexican petroleum industry as a whole, not
                            merely during the present war but also for the period after the war. In
                            many ways, the cooperation of Pemex in this matter at the present time
                            might make it very much easier for Pemex after the war.</p>
                        <p>We believe that an informal approach to Buenrostro or some other
                            appropriate official along the foregoing lines merits your
                            consideration. As indicated in the enclosed telegram from Guatemala
                            City, Pemex has reacted favorably to a similar approach from one of the
                            pool companies, and an official of the Foreign Division of the Petroleum
                            Administration for War has stated his belief, from evidence received
                            during a recent informal conversation with Pemex officials, including
                            the export manager, that Pemex would view favorably the possibility of
                            an arrangement such as that outlined. Conversations by you with the
                            appropriate officials might not only facilitate the proposed arrangement
                            regarding the Guatemalan market but might also assist in the reaching of
                            similar solutions in other Central American countries.</p>
                        <p>If you discuss this matter with the Mexican officials, you should make it
                            clear that the effectuation of the scheme would depend, of course, upon
                            working out all details with the Pool organization and the companies
                            operating therein. It should be understood, of course, that any
                            arrangements between Pemex and the Pool in regard to marketing in the
                            Central American countries would be for the duration of the emergency
                            only.</p>
                        <p>In general connection with this subject it may be pointed out that while
                            Mexican gasoline has been shipped to Central American countries, the
                            United States supplied about 110,000 barrels of gasoline to the northern
                            part of Mexico during the first half of this year, and it is believed
                            that the quantity will be greater during the second half of the year.
                            The supplying of gasoline from this country to northern Mexico has been
                            because of geographic considerations. However, because of the tightness
                            of the gasoline supply situation, it is conceivable that it may not be
                            possible to continue these supplies at this rate.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion we wish again to present the thought that if Pemex
                            continues to try to sell even in small quantities to pool importing <pb
                                n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0483"/>countries and outside the Pool
                            organization, such action must have an adverse effect on the companies
                            cooperating in the Pool, and Mexico, as you know, may have to depend on
                            them for marketing facilities if she is to expand her oil outlets
                            throughout the world.</p>
                        <p>Very truly yours,</p>

                            to Duggan and related correspondence regarding the Mexican petroleum
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>As matters now stand, the Embassy has presented a memorandum to the
                            Mexican Government setting forth for its consideration certain ideas
                            (your despatch 8862 of April 2).<note n="98" xml:id="d402fn98">See
                                footnote 84, <ref target="#pg_458">p. 458</ref>.</note> The Mexican
                            Government has indicated, particularly in the conversation between
                            President Avila Camacho and President Roosevelt, that it considers that
                            the memorandum offers a basis for discussion. It has not, however,
                            presented any definite or specific comment.</p>
                        <p>While the Department has read with interest the material enclosed with
                            your letters of October 20 and October 29 to Duggan, it has no specific
                            comment at this time and believes that detailed consideration of the
                            points raised should await some specific and definitive statement from
                            the Mexican Government with regard to the memorandum which was presented
                            to the Mexican Government last March.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy and the Department seem to be in agreement that this is a
                            question not to be settled by bilateral agreement but rather that
                            following the conclusion of the exchange of views the Mexican Government
                            will issue a statement of policy regarding the exploitation and
                            development of Mexican oil resources, that where necessary this
                            statement will be implemented by proper legislation and regulations, and
                            that agreements will then be negotiated between the Mexican Government
                            and United States companies. This Government will not participate in the
                            negotiation of these agreements, although its good offices will of
                            course be constantly available to facilitate the discussions between the
                            Government and United States private interests.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy is believed to be fully aware of the rapid depletion of
                            United States oil reserves, a depletion greatly accelerated by the great
                            demand for petroleum products during the war. The United <pb n="470"
                                xml:id="pg_470" facs="0484"/>States is rapidly reaching the point
                            where it must import oil from foreign sources. Negotiations are now
                            progressing in many parts of the world to assure the United States the
                            supplies it needs. Against this background, the vast importance of the
                            Mexican negotiations is rat once apparent. The Department is confident
                            that the personal attention which it knows you will give this matter
                            will produce the result so necessary to the future welfare of this
                            country.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s strictly confidential telegram No. 1955 of November 12, 3
                            p.m.…</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Keeping in mind the importance of Mexican oil resources being developed
                            as rapidly and as effectively as possible, I have not failed to keep in
                            mind the desirability of reopening conversations on major oil policy
                            with the President and with the Foreign Minister at the earliest
                            appropriate opportunity. During a conversation which I had the
                            opportunity of having with the President last evening, I stated that I
                            had had this conversation with Mr. Buenrostro, referred to in may letter
                            to Mr. Duggan of November 28,<note n="99" xml:id="d403fn99">Not found in
                                Department files.</note> and that it appeared that the situation
                            with respect to the rehabilitation of the refineries and the
                            construction of the high octane plant were progressing satisfactorily
                            and that if all went well Mr. Buenrostro would be able to go to
                            Washington in December in order to complete the arrangements with the
                            Export-Import Bank concerning these projects. I referred with
                            satisfaction to the final liquidation of the expropriations.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d403fn1">For correspondence on this subject, see <ref
                                    target="#pg_585">pp. 585</ref> ff.</note> I referred to the
                            various memoranda which I submitted to the Mexican Government towards
                            the end of 1942 and early in 1943 with reference to major oil policy and
                            to the statements which he had made to President Roosevelt at Monterrey
                            that in principle he believed these memoranda served as an adequate
                            basis for further conversations.</p>
                        <p>I said to the President that the way now seemed to be thoroughly open for
                            the discussions of this question of major oil policy in the most
                            favorable atmosphere and that it was my intention to begin conversations
                            with Dr. Padilla, the Minister of Foreign Relations, immediately on the
                            basis of the memoranda already submitted. The <pb n="471"
                                xml:id="pg_471" facs="0485"/>President said that he was aware of the
                            importance of this oil problem for us and for Mexico and for this
                            Hemisphere and that he had been giving a good deal of thought to the
                            matter and that I would find Dr. Padilla prepared to continue the
                            discussions. The President said that it would be more helpful for us not
                            to enter into details at the moment until I had carried on the
                            discussions with Dr. Padilla further.</p>
                        <p>I called on Dr. Padilla in the Foreign Office this morning for the
                            purpose of discussing major oil policy and was prepared to do so on the
                            basis of the memoranda under reference and of the Department’s telegram
                            No. 1955 of November 12, 3 p.m. Dr. Padilla said that he was prepared to
                            enter into these discussions. He said that the Mexican Government had
                            been giving very careful consideration to the problem of major oil
                            policy. He said that he was fully familiar with the importance of the
                            problem from our point of view as well as the Mexican point of view and
                            of the advantage to this country. He realized the enormous strain we
                            were placing upon our oil resources in the United States as a major
                            burden for supplying most of the oil and lubricants for the war effort
                            was falling on us.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Padilla said that he had discussed this matter with the President a
                            few days ago and that under directions of the President he was entering
                            into discussions first with Mr. Buenrostro, the head of Pemex, and Mr.
                            Suárez, the Minister of Finance, who is on the Board of Pemex. The
                            Minister said that while he had quite well in mind the memoranda to
                            which I have made reference in this despatch he would wish to refresh
                            his memory and have certain conversations with Mr. Buenrostro and Mr.
                            Suárez before he entered into detailed discussions with me.… The
                            Minister, however, said that the President and he were conscious of the
                            fact that Mr. Buenrostro still believed that it would be possible for
                            Pemex on its own to adequately develop the Mexican oil resources—and
                            without the help of foreign private companies and capital. The Minister
                            said that he thought that Mr. Suárez had a more understanding point of
                            view so far as the necessity for the intervention of foreign companies
                            and private capital were concerned. He had, therefore, made arrangements
                            to meet with Mr. Suárez and Mr. Buenrostro before the end of this week
                            in order to have a thorough discussion of this point. He made it clear
                            that it would be necessary to convince Mr. Buenrostro of the fact that
                            Pemex on its own resources would not be able adequately to develop the
                            Mexican oil resources.</p>
                        <p>I said to the Minister that I was happy to hear that he and his
                            associates were giving this continued and careful thought and to have
                            this expression of his views. I said that as he knew, it was my opinion,
                            and the opinion of my Government, that Pemex under the <pb n="472"
                                xml:id="pg_472" facs="0486"/>most favorable circumstances would not
                            be able to develop the Mexican oil resources adequately within the next
                            50 years and by that time another fuel might have been discovered which
                            would make the potential oils under the Mexican soil of no avail. I said
                            that he realized from the memoranda which we had submitted that we
                            envisaged the collaboration of American companies, and of foreign
                            companies if the Mexican Government so saw fit, in the form of contracts
                            with Mexico. I said that the matter had constantly a greater urgency and
                            that I hoped that we would be able to renew our conversations very
                            shortly.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that he thought a great deal of ground would be gained
                            if he had this conversation first with Mr. Suárez and Mr. Buenrostro and
                            that immediately thereafter he would get in touch with me. He said that
                            in the meantime he would also again study very carefully the various
                            memoranda which we had submitted, which, however, he felt he had well in
                            mind for he had been giving this matter constant thought.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the Department’s telegram No. 2050 of November 27,
                                noon,<note n="2" xml:id="d403fn2">Not printed.</note> covering the
                            conversation with Mr. Garfías of the Cities Service, I thought it
                            advisable in view of approaching conversations between the Minister and
                            Mr. Suárez and Mr. Buenrostro to inform him of the fact that Mr. Garfías
                            has been discussing the matter of his company with Mr. Suárez, the
                            Minister of Finance. I told the Minister that we had informed Mr.
                            Garfías that it has been and was the view of the Department and of this
                            Embassy that it would be more desirable to await the conclusion of the
                            conversations between our Government and the Mexican Government before
                            specific conversations with the Mexican Government or Pemex were entered
                            into with private companies. I said that Mr. Garfías had indicated that
                            in his opinion Mr. Suárez was empowered to negotiate an agreement with
                            Cities Service and I said that I doubted this in view of the fact that I
                            doubted whether the Mexican Government would be prepared to proceed in
                            conversations with an individual company before it had made any
                            determination of policy. The Minister indicated that this was his
                            view.</p>
                        <p>I shall keep the Department fully informed of developments and I shall
                            keep this matter actively before the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the
                            President.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my strictly
                            confidential despatch no. 14524 of November 30, 1943 with respect to the
                            conversations which I have been having with the Mexican Government on
                            major oil policy in which I referred particularly to the Department’s
                            strictly confidential telegram no. 1955 of November 12, 3 p.m.</p>
                        <p>I was finally able to make an appointment with the Minister of Foreign
                            Relations, Dr. Padilla, for a full discussion of major oil policy for
                            December 20 at noon. I had at least a three hour conversation with him
                            on this matter which, on the whole, was most encouraging.</p>
                        <p>Although, as the Department is aware, I have been in constant touch with
                            the Minister of Foreign Relations on questions of major oil policy which
                            I have also discussed from time to time with the President of Mexico, I
                            had not been able recently to have any discussion with respect to
                            details in view of the fact that the Minister informed me that he was
                            actively pursuing conversations under directive of the President with
                            various of the members of the Government more particularly interested in
                            this matter.</p>
                        <p>In view of the increasing urgency of the Mexican Government reaching a
                            decision with regard to major oil policy, I thought it desirable for my
                            conversation with the Minister today to prepare for my own assistance
                            and guidance a memorandum of points to be discussed during the
                            conversation. I, therefore, prepared yesterday a very full statement
                            covering in résumé the two major memoranda which I have left with the
                            Mexican Government in August of last year<note n="3" xml:id="d404fn3"

                            full consideration by the Minister and his associates.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>… He said that he understood that we were in complete agreement as to the
                            recognition of the principle that all subsoil rights were the property
                            of the Mexican Government and people. I assured him that we were. He
                            said that he took it for granted that we were in agreement that the
                            American companies and American capital should come in not through
                            concessions but rather through contracts with Petroleos Mexicanos or the
                            Mexican Government which contracts <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474"
                                facs="0488"/>would clearly define the limits of action of the
                            companies. I said on this point there would be no question. The Minister
                            said that he understood that we were in agreement that the refining and
                            distribution of oil for Mexico’s own purposes and needs should not in
                            any way be touched by these contracts as these would remain monopolies
                            of Pemex. I said on this point I felt sure there would be full
                            understanding and no lack of agreement but I expressed the hope that the
                            Mexican Government would not in its declaration of policy altogether
                            exclude the possibility of American companies refining some of the oil
                            which they produced in Mexico with the understanding, of course, that
                            the production would be first available to Petroleos Mexicanos for
                            internal use in Mexico at fixed prices—if so desired. I said that I
                            thought it would not be advisable in the interest of the Mexican economy
                            or industry to close the door entirely to the eventual possibility of
                            some of the American companies being permitted to engage in refining
                            operations as long as such operations did not conflict or compete with
                            those of Pemex. The Minister expressed a good deal of understanding of
                            this point of view. The Minister further said, of course, that it would
                            have to be understood that all questions affecting labor, etc., in
                            connection with the refineries were under the complete authority of the
                            Mexican Government and that companies brought in under contract would
                            not claim any special privileges in this connection. I told the Minister
                            that I was sure there was full understanding of this by the
                            companies.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that on the basis of these general understandings he
                            thought he was making progress with the other members of the Government
                            towards a definition of major oil policy. The Minister said that his
                            Government was very glad to discuss this matter with us prior to
                            reaching its decisions on major oil policy, as it considered it of
                            primary importance that Mexico and the United States should work
                            together in this matter. He said, of course, once the Mexican Government
                            arrived at its decisions with respect to oil policy, they would be made
                            as a unilateral statement of the Mexican Government but he was
                            exceedingly hopeful that the policy formulated by the Mexican Government
                            would be entirely satisfactory to our Government before it was put in
                            final form. He considered this as absolutely essential in view of the
                            fact that as he saw it, American companies and capital could and should
                            play the major part in the development of Mexican oil resources so far
                            as foreign capital is concerned.</p>
                        <p>In this connection the Minister made some interesting observations with
                            regard to the negotiations under progress with Great Britain for the
                            settlement of the expropriation of the British and Dutch companies and I
                            will refer to this in another communication. It is interesting, however,
                            to note that from the Minister’s conversation, it <pb n="475"
                                xml:id="pg_475" facs="0489"/>was obvious that he is of the opinion
                            that Mexico’s oil policy must be more closely coordinated with that of
                            the United States than with that of any other country. The Minister is
                            deeply appreciative of the importance of Mexican oil resources and
                            reserves as a matter of continental security and also as a matter of
                            primary concern to us because of our rapid exhaustion of our reserves
                            due to the tremendous amount of oil we are putting into the War effort.
                            I gathered from his conversation that the attitude towards American
                            capital and American companies was favorable and that the Mexican
                            Government would look with more favor on American capital and companies
                            in this relationship with Pemex than that of other countries.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I may say that I have endeavored in a very proper way
                            to emphasize to various officials of the Mexican Government the
                            importance which I attach to our companies being given a chance and
                            perhaps preferential treatment but at least a first chance in view of
                            the fact that in many respects they are in a better position to aid in
                            the development of Mexico’s oil resources than those of any other
                            country. I feel sure that the President and the Minister of Foreign
                            Relations share this idea. I am not yet certain to what degree it is
                            shared by other members of the Government.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated that he realized the essential importance of Mexico’s
                            reaching rapid action on this matter and that he would do everything to
                            facilitate the formulation of a statement of major oil policy. He gave
                            me the hope that the matter was developing in a very satisfactory way
                            and that he would soon have “very good news” for me.</p>
                        <p>He understands that it is my intention to leave here around January 10 or
                            11 for a two weeks’ stay in Washington and he said that he hoped that
                            before I left I would have some very definite and favorable information
                            which I could transmit to the Department at that time.</p>
                        <p>The Department will understand that my leaving this informal memorandum
                            hereto attached<note n="5" xml:id="d404fn5">Not printed.</note> with the
                            Minister does not undertake any commitment for our Government whatever
                            as I made it clear that the memorandum had been prepared for my own
                            guidance only during my conversation with him and that I was leaving it
                            with him specifically with the understanding that it was an informal and
                            unofficial document which might be of some use to him in the
                            consideration he would give to our conversation of it.</p>

                                Secretary of State.</note> The Department, as you are aware, is
                            fully cognizant of and sympathetic with the difficulties which confront
                            the Mexican Government in its program of eliminating Axis influence from
                            the Mexican firms which were placed in category I in your despatch no.
                            3415 of August 19,1942.<note n="7" xml:id="d405fn7"><p>Despatch No. 3415
                                    of August 19, not printed. The Ambassador enclosed a memorandum
                                    dated August 10, 1942, agreed upon with the Department which he
                                    had presented to the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                    (Padilla). This memorandum explained at length the “Proclaimed
                                    List of Certain Blocked Nationals” and had as annexes lists of
                                    firms on the Proclaimed List domiciled in Mexico, divided into
                                    three categories: The first category contained the names of
                                    those persons and companies whose business was essential to
                                    Mexican economy; the second category contained those of little
                                    economic importance; and the third included the names of
                                    Japanese, Italians, and Germans who should remain on the
                                    Proclaimed List.</p><p>The memorandum expressed the desire of
                                    the Government of the United States to cooperate closely with
                                    the Mexican Government in eliminating enemy interests.</p><p>The
                                    Ambassador reported that the Mexican Minister for Foreign
                                    Affairs had told the Ambassador that he could depend upon the
                                    most loyal collaboration of his Ministry and the Mexican
                                    Government.</p></note> At the same time the Department wishes to
                            take all practicable steps to terminate as soon as possible the present
                            situation which is unsatisfactory both from the point of view of the
                            Mexican Government and hemisphere defense. The appointment of
                            governmental interventors has, in the eyes of the Mexican public,
                            substantially removed the stigma which previously attached to firms
                            included in the Proclaimed List, and to this extent has seriously
                            impaired the effectiveness of the Proclaimed List program.</p>
                        <p>During the present period following intervention and prior to vesting no
                            adequate local controls have become effective to compensate for this
                            serious impairment of our Proclaimed List controls. In addition, during
                            this period, no names have been or are being added to the Proclaimed
                            List for Mexico although facts have been reported which would ordinarily
                            result in such inclusions. In as much as the procedure which has been
                            agreed upon for the establishing of supplementary local controls by
                            Mexico is being watched with considerable interest as the basis for
                            meeting similar problems in other American republics, the Department
                            believes that it should do everything that it can to assist in a
                            successful conclusion of this program, which has been agreed upon by the
                            Department and the Mexican Government, <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477"
                                facs="0491"/>for adjusting Proclaimed List controls to the economic
                            and defense needs of Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Undoubtedly both the Policy Council and the Committee of Vigilance and
                            Administration by now have a clear conception of the problems faced by
                            Mexico in executing its agreement last August.<note n="8"

                            realized that these problems may be substantial and it is also believed

                                <item>The exact nature of any difficulties which may be confronting
                                    the Mexican Government in this connection, e.g., whether the
                                    Mexicans are faced with any difficulties because of their
                                    comparative inexperience in certain industrial enterprises, the
                                    dearth of managerial and technical personnel, unavailable local
                                    capital, or the lack of trained governmental administrators;
                                    whether the government is confronted with any serious problem
                                    because of the influence of the undesirable firms in deterring
                                    the government in the execution of the program.</item>

                                <item>What progress the Mexicans have made in planning solutions to
                                    the problems confronting them? Whether the Mexican authorities
                                    have set for themselves any date at which it may be expected
                                    that a substantial number of the undesirable firms will have
                                    been vested following the elimination of all pro-Axis elements.
                                    We shall be particularly interested in being advised as to
                                    whether the Policy Committee and the Committee of Vigilance and
                                    Administration have formulated any overall program and any
                                    concrete plans for specific firms or industries. The Department
                                    is, of course, aware of the tentative plan that the American
                                    Cyanamid Company assume the management of the chemical, drug and
                                    pharmaceutical enterprises which have been intervened. We should
                                    be interested to know whether similar proposals have been made
                                    in respect of other types of enterprises included in Category

                                    governmental assistance, such as Export-Import Bank credits, may
                                    be required. In this connection it would be helpful to know
                                    whether the Mexicans wish offers of assistance at this time and,
                                    if so, what form such offers should take. The discussion of this
                                    topic will obviously be most fruitful if it can concretely be
                                    related to specific enterprises or industries.</item>

                            Despatch No. 2045 of June 13, 1942, which was accompanied by the text of
                            the Mexican decree, which relates to the subject of trading with the
                            enemy, the Regulations pertaining thereto and the English translations

                        <p>The Embassy has ascertained that the Board of Administration and
                            Vigilance which, under the promulgated Regulations, is the body
                            authorized and empowered to administer the intervented properties, has
                            initiated action for the disposal of certain of the seized concerns.</p>
                        <p>The findings of an investigation undertaken by the Embassy are furnished
                            for the Department’s general information and also as a matter of
                            possible particular interest since it is conceivable that persons who
                            are interested in acquiring these concerns from the Mexican Government,
                            may seek to finance their purchases or their subsequent operations
                            through the introduction and utilization of American capital.</p>
                        <p>El Nuevo Japón, S. A., was the first of such seized firms to be offered
                            for sale. In the issue of the Mexican official publication, <hi

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that a conference was held at the Foreign Office on January 25 between
                            Mr. Tello,<note n="15" xml:id="d408fn15">Manuel Tello, Chief of the
                                Diplomatic Section of the Mexican Foreign Office.</note> the
                            Commercial Attaché<note n="16" xml:id="d408fn16">Charles A. Bay.</note>
                            and the Economic Counselor<note n="17" xml:id="d408fn17">Thomas H.
                                Lockett.</note> on several different subjects, including: (1) the
                            Proclaimed List; (2) seizure of intransit rubber; and (3) payments to
                            Switzerland for merchandise. This was the first of a series of informal
                            conferences to be held at the suggestion of the Foreign Office in order
                            that various subjects might be treated informally instead of by means of
                            the more formal procedure of notes or memoranda. This despatch treats
                            only that part of the conversation which concerned the Proclaimed
                            List.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Tello said that the Inter-Secretarial Committee, composed of Cabinet
                            Ministers, had reached the conclusion that the Mexican Government had
                            taken very strong and advanced measures in the case of intervented Axis
                            firms, in fact, much stronger and more severe than had been the action
                            by most other nations. Mr. Tello said that, however, this was not the
                            reason why the informal conferences had been suggested, but, the
                            Inter-Secretarial Committee wanted our Government to know that certain
                            insurmountable difficulties had been encountered by the Mexican
                            Government in its attempt to carry out all of the provisions of the
                            Alien Property Law. He stated that under the circumstances it was
                            decided that through informal conferences an avenue of procedure could
                            be worked out which would be acceptable to the American Government as
                            well as feasible for execution by the Mexican Government.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>In summary, the suggestions of Mr. Tello are that (1) intervented <pb
                                n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0495"/>firms which have been
                            sufficiently freed of undesirable elements should be removed from the
                            Proclaimed List; (2) those intervented firms not sufficiently freed of
                            undesirable elements to warrant removal from the Proclaimed List should
                            be studied and suggestions made as to what requirements must be
                            fulfilled to cause their removal; (3) those companies on List III of
                            sufficient size to warrant intervention should be suggested for such
                            action; (4) those companies on List III not of sufficient size to
                            warrant permanent intervention should be listed for closing; and (5)
                            individuals on List III could not be placed on a Mexican blacklist, but
                            should be retained on the American Proclaimed List.</p>
                        <p>The above-described conference with Mr. Tello is of particular importance
                            because of the very unsatisfactory situation which had developed in
                            reference to the intervented Axis companies. The interventors in these
                            companies are direct representatives of the Federal Government. They
                            have taken over the management, accounts, property and transactions of
                            the companies. The Mexican Government has taken the position that these
                            companies are now under the full jurisdiction of the Government and,
                            therefore, there should be no interference in any transactions which
                            they perform or which are performed with them within Mexican territory.
                            These intervented companies are sending out orders to non-Proclaimed
                            List companies in Mexico which are signed or approved by the Federal
                            interventors. If the non-Proclaimed List company refuses to supply the
                            materials on the basis that the intervented company is upon the American
                            Proclaimed List, then, the interventor immediately takes the matter up
                            with the non-Proclaimed List company on the basis that it is refusing to
                            sell to a company under the management of the Federal Government. The
                            Department will well appreciate that this places us in a very
                            embarrassing and uncomfortable situation, because in many cases imported
                            American products are involved. The situation becomes more embarrassing
                            when the non-Proclaimed List company asks the Embassy as to whether or
                            not it should supply the material to the intervented company which is
                            still upon the Proclaimed List. In other words, as matters now stand
                            with reference to the intervented companies, many non-Proclaimed List
                            companies are afraid not to supply the requests of the former, because
                            of action which might be taken against them by the Federal Government.
                            Consequently, the effects of the Proclaimed List, as far as transactions
                            with intervented companies within Mexico are concerned, are being
                            rapidly and surely annulled and the longer this situation is allowed to
                            exist, the more chaotic it will become. Although these intervented
                            companies cannot import direct from the United States, under force of
                            pressure they are causing companies which do import direct to sell them
                                <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0496"/>merchandise. The Embassy
                            has never taken the position that it has any control over commercial
                            acts performed within the territory of Mexico, but, it has observed very
                            carefully such transactions with Proclaimed List firms and has
                            recommended to the Department that companies in Mexico dealing with
                            Proclaimed List firms be placed upon the List so that they could not
                            receive products from the United States. The pressure now being employed
                            by the interventors is producing quite an unsatisfactory situation as
                            far as the Proclaimed List is concerned and, therefore, the results of
                            our conversation with Mr. Tello are of vital importance in arriving at a
                            solution of the Proclaimed List problem in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>What Mr. Tello suggested is nothing other than the beginning of the
                            solution of the second half of the Proclaimed List problem as suggested
                            by Ambassador Messersmith to the Foreign Office. This unsatisfactory
                            interim period was anticipated and could not have been avoided,
                            therefore, the quicker the solution for the second half of the problem
                            is put into effect, the sooner will the entire problem be satisfactorily
                            disposed of.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s viewpoints on this subject are very urgently requested.
                            A copy of this despatch is being forwarded for the personal attention of
                            Ambassador Messersmith who is familiar in every detail with this
                            problem. The subject of this despatch has been fully discussed with the
                            Chargé d’Affaires ad interim.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the Embassy’s
                            despatch 7286 of February 8, 1943, concerning the conference at the
                            Foreign Office on January 25, 1943, between Señor Tello, the Commercial
                            Attaché and the Economic Counselor of the Embassy with regard to
                            Proclaimed List matters, and to inform the Department that following
                            Señor Tello’s promise to submit to the Embassy a statement of the action
                            taken by the Mexican Government with respect to intervened firms, the
                            Embassy received a memorandum dated February 13, 1943<note n="18"
                                xml:id="d409fn18">Not printed.</note> containing data on this
                            subject. Señor Tello recently telephoned the Embassy, stating that he
                            desired to confer with Messrs. Lockett and <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483"
                                facs="0497"/>Bay concerning Proclaimed List matters in general, as
                            well as with regard to several specific cases. The date set for the
                            conference was February 18 at 5 p.m., and accordingly, Messrs. Lockett
                            and Bay presented themselves at the specified hour. Señor Vicente
                            Sánchez Gavito, Assistant Chief of the Diplomatic Section, was also
                            present.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow three paragraphs dealing with specific cases.]</p>
                        <p>The three memoranda mentioned herein<note n="19" xml:id="d409fn19">Not
                                printed.</note> related to reports that the officials of the
                            Embassy, as well as some American consular officers in the Republic,
                            were warning various firms and individuals not to purchase from firms
                            intervened by the Mexican Government. Mr. Lockett observed that the
                            Embassy as well as the consular officers were informing all persons that
                            purely domestic transactions did not come within their consideration in
                            connection with the Proclaimed List, except insofar as it was necessary
                            to point out that persons or firms dealing with Proclaimed List firms
                            and individuals and who might later seek importations from the United
                            States were liable to find that the United States Government would deny
                            export permits of material to such persons. In other words, Mr. Lockett
                            made it clear that in the application of the Proclaimed List, officials
                            of our Government were careful to avoid the appearance of interfering in
                            domestic transactions; but in some transactions, persons trading with
                            Proclaimed List firms might later wish to make importations from the
                            United States. Persons or firms falling within this category, Mr.
                            Lockett emphasized, might find difficulties in obtaining importations
                            from the United States. This distinction, Mr. Lockett observed, might be
                            the cause of the confusion in the reports reaching the Mexican
                            authorities that our consular officers had warned against purely
                            domestic transactions, which was not of course the desire of the
                            Embassy.</p>
                        <p>Copies of the memorandum left with Messrs. Lockett and Bay are hereto
                                attached.<note n="19" xml:id="d409fn20">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>In conclusion, it is desired to point out that Señores Tello and Sanchez
                            Gavito were pleased with the result of the conference and said they
                            would await the fixing by Mr. Lockett of a future date for continuing
                            the conversations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Bursley</hi>: A few days ago several
                            officers of the Department and I had a lengthy discussion with
                            Ambassador Messersmith concerning the progress being made by the Mexican
                            Government in cleaning-up Proclaimed List firms in Mexico. We indicated
                            to the Ambassador that we were disturbed at the apparent slowness on the
                            part of the Mexican Government to take effective action and that we
                            desired to know whether there was anything which the Department could do
                            which might help the Mexicans to speed up their program. The Ambassador
                            detailed to us the problems which the Mexicans had to face in carrying
                            out such a program and the difficulties which the Embassy had
                            encountered in attempting to obtain speedy action.</p>
                        <p>During the course of the conversation the Ambassador was asked whether
                            there was a lack of desirable financial resources in Mexico to take over
                            Proclaimed List firms which were essential to the Mexican economy and,
                            if so, whether an offer of financial assistance from this Government
                            might help to remedy this difficulty. We indicated to the Ambassador
                            that this Government was prepared in appropriate cases to offer such
                            assistance through the facilities of the Export-Import Bank in
                            connection with the replacement programs instituted by the other
                            American republics where the firms involved were essential to the local
                            economies. The Ambassador replied that there was a lack of desirable
                            financial resources to take over Proclaimed List firms essential to the
                            Mexican economy and that this was a factor which hampered the Mexicans
                            in pushing their program to a successful conclusion. He stated that he
                            thought that an offer of financial assistance from us might be very
                            helpful to the Embassy staff in its negotiations with the Mexican
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>We told the Ambassador that a circular instruction on the role of United
                            States financial assistance in programs for the cleaning-up of
                            Proclaimed List firms essential to the economies of the other American
                            republics was in the process of preparation and would be forwarded to
                            the missions very shortly.<note n="20" xml:id="d410fn20">This
                                instruction was not issued until June 18, 1943; not printed.</note>
                            That instruction would give the Embassy the necessary information upon
                            which to base discussions with the Mexican officials. The Ambassador
                            indicated, however, that it might be very helpful if you and Mr. Lockett
                            knew of the possibility of United States financial assistance as soon as
                            possible. He believed that this would give you and Mr. Lockett an
                            opportunity to think about the matter before the circular instruction
                            arrived and possibly even discuss it in a general way and informally
                            with the appropriate <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0499"/>Mexican
                            officials. In the meantime, the circular instruction of December 17,
                                1942<note n="21" xml:id="d410fn21">Not printed.</note> (page 2) may
                            also be of assistance.</p>
                        <p>We in the Department are most anxious to do everything possible to assist
                            the Mexicans in carrying out an effective program of economic warfare.
                            If United States financial assistance in connection with the taking over
                            of Proclaimed List firms will be of help in this connection, we are
                            prepared to do everything possible to see that such assistance is made
                            available. I realize that it will be difficult for you to explore the
                            possibilities involved in the availability of United States financial
                            assistance without first having a blueprint of the manner in which such
                            assistance would be made available. However, the information in this
                            letter should give you something to start on and, as a matter of fact,
                            it would be advisable for you not to go into details with the Mexicans
                            or make any final commitment to them until we have first brought the
                            possibility of such assistance to their attention and obtained their
                            views.</p>
                        <p>After you have had an opportunity to consider the question raised by this
                            letter, I shall be happy to try to give you any further information
                            which you desire.</p>

                            despatch No. 8146 of March 11, 1943,<note n="26" xml:id="d412fn26">Not
                                printed.</note> concerning a conference at the Foreign Office on
                            March 11, 1943, regarding Proclaimed List matters between officials of
                            the Ministry of Foreign Relations and the Ambassador, who was
                            accompanied by the Counselor of Embassy for Economic Affairs and the
                            Commercial Attaché. In the third paragraph of this despatch, reference
                            was made among other things to a brief discussion that took place on
                            this occasion with regard to the desire of the Ambassador to have
                            certain information concerning the status of German firms in which the
                            Mexican Government has intervened. The Under Secretary, Señor Torres
                            Bodet, gave a short exposition of the Mexican viewpoint and suggested
                            that the questions be submitted in the form of a memorandum, in order
                            that the Foreign Office could prepare a reply giving in detail the
                            information he gave in substance. There is now transmitted herewith for
                            the Department’s information a copy of the Embassy’s memorandum
                            incorporating questions as submitted by the Embassy, and also a copy of
                            the memorandum received in reply from the Foreign Office together with
                            an English translation thereof.<note n="27" xml:id="d412fn27">None

                        <p>The communication from the Foreign Office states in definite terms that
                            the title of ownership of the intervened firms has been transferred to
                            the Mexican Government, which has the right to administer or dispose of
                            the properties subject to final disposition by the Congress at the
                            termination of the state of war. During the period between intervention
                            and final disposition of the properties by the Congress, the original
                            owners have no title or any right to the properties, and neither the
                            owners nor the employees removed from the companies have any connection
                            with those companies. The compensation being paid to the original owners
                            and employees removed from the companies is said to be a concession
                            based upon humanitarian considerations and is being paid in monthly
                            installments for subsistence purposes so long as the beneficiaries
                            conduct themselves in a proper manner.</p>
                        <p>No reference has been made in the various informal conversations with the
                            Foreign Office officials on this subject, to the status of trade marks,
                            copyrights and patents belonging to the intervened firms. This subject
                            will be taken up by the Embassy in order to obtain, if possible, <pb

                            conditions have been fulfilled. The most important conditions on the

                            companies with the company, Técnicos Químicos, to be organized by the
                            American Cyanamid Company. On its part, the American Cyanamid Company
                            agrees to organize the administrative company, Técnicos Químicos, S. A.,
                            and through the latter organization to sign a contract of administration
                            with Química y Farmaceutica.</p>
                        <p>There is one very important point in this agreement to make a contract.
                            It stipulates that the Mexican Government will expropriate the
                            intervented companies destined to form a part of the Government group to
                            be administered by Técnicos Químicos. This feature came somewhat as a
                            surprise, at [<hi rend="italic">as</hi>] it is believed that the
                            Government has the right under the Enemy Alien Property Law to transfer
                            these properties as it sees fit, without resorting to expropriation.
                            Col. Pope said that there seemed to be no objection on the part of the
                            Mexican Government to expropriating the properties and that, in fact,
                            this procedure would best meet the situation. If the properties are
                            expropriated, it would mean that the original enemy owners could not
                            anticipate the return of their properties after the war, but, they would
                            hold the right to demand payment under the Expropriation Law. In the
                            case of enemy owners, such funds paid to them would be blocked by the
                            Bank of Mexico to await the decision of the Congress after the
                            termination of the emergency. If the Mexican Government is willing to
                            expropriate the properties in question, it would probably afford the
                            greatest guarantee that the properties themselves would not be returned
                            to the original owners.</p>
                        <p>The contract of administration (Appendix B) would be signed between the
                            Government-controlled company, Química y Farmaceutica, S. A. de C. V.,
                            and Técnicos Químicos, S. A., a company to be organized by the American
                            Cyanamid Company, to operate and administer the cited properties. As it
                            is understood that the provisions of this contract are mutually
                            acceptable to both parties, its importance arises not so much from its
                            details as from the advisability or inadvisability of creating a huge
                            pharmaceutical, chemical, dye, etc. industry in Mexico. It is well to
                            bear in mind that the company to be organized by the Mexican Government,
                            Química y Farmaceutica, will be owned and controlled in its majority by
                            the Mexican Government. This company will be the sole owner of the
                            properties to be passed to it dior administration and operation by
                            Técnicos Químicos. If these intervented companies were being bought and
                            organized into a single group by a private corporation, there would be
                            many reasons to look upon such action with disfavor, because it would
                            constitute a state of private monopoly. It is not believed that the
                            Mexican Government <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0503"/>would permit
                            the creation of a private monopoly of this nature. Under the proposed
                            procedure, the Mexican Government will be indirect owner of the
                            properties and can exercise a control over the activities of Técnicos
                            Químicos to such an extent as it may think advisable to prevent
                            monopolistic tendencies to the injury of competitors. In this respect,
                            reference is made to Article Ten of the agreement to be signed by the
                            Mexican Government and the American Cyanamid Company, which states that
                            it is “the desire of the parties to this agreement…<note n="30"
                                xml:id="d413fn30">Omission indicated in the original
                                despatch.</note> to encourage the free and unrestricted development
                            of the Mexican chemical industry, and nothing contained in this
                            contract, nor in Appendixes B and C hereof, is to be construed as
                            intending to prohibit or restrain any other company from engaging in
                            similar businesses in Mexico, or manufacturing, importing, selling or
                            exporting chemical products of any kind.”</p>
                        <p>The administrative contract between Química y Farmaceutica and Técnicos
                            Químicos will expire on December 31, 1949. It contains a provision for
                            an additional period of three years, provided, notice of discontinuance
                            is not given by either party six months prior to the expiration date.
                            This means that during the six-year period Técnicos Químicos will
                            organize the cited industries into one group and it is believed that
                            under the management of Cyanamid a very formidable pharmaceutical,
                            chemical, dye, paint, etc. industry will result. This industry will
                            undoubtedly manufacture many products which originally came from Germany
                            and other countries of Europe and, in addition, a number of products
                            which were imported from the United States. At the end of six years, the
                            Mexican Government can discharge the American Cyanamid Company and
                            assume the administration of the organization developed by the latter. A
                            period of six years into the future is too long to hazard a prediction,
                            but, it is probably safe to say that such a huge and intricate industry
                            would continue to need the management and consultation of such a company
                            as American Cyanamid. Nevertheless, there is always the risk that after
                            the six-year period of administration by Cyanamid, the Germans might
                            gradually work into the organization, or, that the German
                            pharmaceutical, chemical and dye industry, re-established after the war,
                            might secure the predominance of sales to the Government-owned industry.
                            In spite of this possibility, however, the re-entrance of Germans into
                            their formerly-owned companies will be much greater if some such plan as
                            that suggested by Col. Pope is not put into operation.</p>
                        <p>Should Col. Pope’s plan be rejected and the intervented companies remain
                            under intervention as at present until the end of the emergency, it is
                            the general belief that the former enemy owners will be <pb n="490"
                                xml:id="pg_490" facs="0504"/>able to bring sufficient influenceto
                            bear in various ways to regain their properties. This is one of the
                            things which we are trying to avoid. Should the Mexican Government
                            retain these companies under interventorship, there arises another
                            certainty which will develop as soon as Germany can begin shipping
                            chemical, pharmaceuticals and dyestuffs. When that time arrives, the
                            intervented companies will surely turn to Germany for a large percentage
                            of their requirements. On the contrary, if the intervented companies are
                            under the administration of the American Cyanamid Company, as provided
                            for in the contract, purchases from Germany can be held to a minimum
                            and, during the six-year period, American and Mexican products can be so
                            well entrenched in the Mexican market that I. G. Farben will find it
                            difficult to re-establish its products.</p>
                        <p>The contract provides that all trade-marks, patents, advertisements, etc.
                            belonging to or used by the intervented company will become the property
                            of the Government-owned company, Química y Farmaceutica, S. A. de C. V.,
                            and that such of them as may be desired by Técnicos Químicos would be
                            for the exclusive use of the latter. If Técnicos Químicos does not wish
                            to use any of them, they will probable lie idle for at least the life of
                            the contract. Those selected by Técnicos Químicos would become known as
                            Mexican instead of German during the six-year period and, therefore, it
                            is reasonable to assume that the Mexican Government would not be willing
                            to release them.</p>
                        <p>Col. Pope was asked about his intentions with respect to selling and
                            distributing products of other American companies through the wholesale
                            and retail outlets of the new organization. He said that he had every
                            intention of giving the public what it wanted and, consequently,
                            products of other manufacturers would have full access to the
                            distribution made by Técnicos Químicos. It seems to be quite certain
                            that the Government will insist that Técnicos Químicos give private
                            manufacturers an equal opportunity to distribute their merchandise
                            through the new company.</p>
                        <p>It is recognized that the gradual building up of a pharmaceutical,
                            chemical and dye industry in Mexico will affect imports from the United
                            States along those lines, but, the corollary is that the demand for
                            other products will increase. If Mexico is not permitted to further
                            industrialize, then we can look forward again to a post-war period in
                            which the country will be drained of its financial resources to pay for
                            an excess of imports of consumer goods. Industrialization up to a
                            certain point will help Mexico solve many of its problems and afford us
                            a prosperous instead of a bankrupt neighbor.</p>
                        <p>The viewpoints stated in this despatch are given in the hope that they
                            will be of some assistance in aiding the Department to reach a decision
                            in the case of the contract between American Cyanamid and <pb n="491"
                                xml:id="pg_491" facs="0505"/>the Mexican Government. Since the
                            Mexican Government is a party to the contract and agrees to the
                            establishment of the new industry, it is believed that the probable
                            results will be worth the trial. The Economic Counselor recalls that
                            during the early months succeeding the institution of the Proclaimed
                            List, he made every effort to induce our independent drug manufacturers
                            to jointly organize a distributing company in Mexico. There was much
                            talking about the matter, but they could not get together. As a result,
                            some of our pharmaceutical companies made distributing arrangements with
                            Mexican companies already in existence which are much weaker than such
                            companies as Beick Felix and Carlos Stein. Several of the American
                            companies, particularly, Sydney Ross and Abbott Laboratories handled
                            their own distribution. The point is that our distributing talents are
                            dispersed and are not unified and, therefore, should the Germans
                            re-enter Mexico and regain their properties, we would be once more
                            confronted with unified distribution, which is difficult to meet through
                            individual sales efforts.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that the informal conferences on Proclaimed List matters between the
                            Foreign Office and the Embassy are taking place weekly and that the
                            progress being made is beyond what could have been anticipated. At these
                            conferences, Ingeniero Topete Bordes is the representative from the
                            Junta Administrativa and his honesty of purpose, frankness and profound
                            knowledge of the action taken by the Junta has convinced the Embassy
                            representatives of the earnestness and the thoroughness with which the
                            Junta Administrativa has cleaned up the intervened companies since the
                            Ambassador presented his informal memorandum to the Foreign Office on
                            August 10, 1942. The Ambassador’s memorandum was forwarded to the
                            Department in despatch No. 3415 of August 19, 1942.<note n="31"
                                xml:id="d414fn31">Not printed.</note> This memorandum created the
                            three lists which <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0506"/>constituted
                            the three categories for all names upon the Proclaimed List. List No. 1
                            was composed of those companies and individuals, of prime importance to
                            Mexico’s national economy, which should be intervened by the Mexican
                            Government; List No. II comprised the names of Mexicans and others of
                            little economic consequence which could be deleted as soon as List No. I
                            was cleaned up to the satisfaction of our Government; and List No. III
                            contained names of Japanese, Italians and Germans which should remain
                            upon the Proclaimed List.</p>
                        <p>At the time the Ambassador prepared his informal memorandum to the
                            Foreign Office, the Mexican Government was demanding that our Government
                            take some immediate action which would free the intervened companies
                            from the Proclaimed List, because the latter were under the operation
                            and ownership of the Mexican Government, The expressed attitude of the
                            Mexican Government at that time was that the American Government should
                            not retain the intervened firms on the Proclaimed List because they
                            actually formed or were a part of the Mexican Government. The Mexican
                            Government said that, since these intervened firms were a part of the
                            Mexican Government, the American Government had no right to say that
                            internal transactions with the intervened firms would be a cause for
                            listing upon the Proclaimed List. The stand of the Mexican Government
                            was firm and, if maintained, portended the complete breakdown of the
                            effects of the Proclaimed List within Mexico, with the exception of the
                            control of exports from the United States by our Government, The demand
                            of the Mexican Government for a delisting of intervened firms was so
                            firm that it might have become the basis of a serious diplomatic
                            controversy between the two Governments.</p>
                        <p>In such circumstances and conditions, the Ambassador took a very prudent,
                            wise and courageous step when he proposed the global plan for a
                            settlement of Proclaimed List matters in Mexico and presented it to the
                            Foreign Minister, with the result that it saved our Government from an
                            interchange of notes which might have proved extremely serious in our
                            relations. The importance of bringing to a satisfactory conclusion as
                            soon as possible the global settlement envisaged by the Ambassador and
                            presented to the Foreign Office in his memorandum of August 10, 1942, is
                            therefore apparent and cannot be over-emphasized. A settlement of this
                            nature is so vital and important that it would be a serious mistake to
                            let it be deterred or interfered with by a mass of minor considerations.
                            The Mexican Government accepted the plan presented by the Ambassador in
                            the good faith in which it was proposed and the minute it realizes that
                            we are hampering or being unwilling to fulfill our end of the bargain,
                            then, the Proclaimed List will return to the status in which it existed
                            at the time the Ambassador <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0507"
                            />presented his original memorandum of August 10, 1942. If this is
                            permitted to take place, it would doubtless be very unfortunate for our
                            relationships and greatly interfere with the solution of many other
                            major problems which are now under consideration. This we cannot afford
                            to permit, therefore the Embassy desires to urge the Department to give
                            its prompt and careful consideration to such recommendations as the
                            Embassy is making for deletions from the Proclaimed List after
                            consultation with the Mexican Government.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Embassy
                            that the intervened companies are the property of the Mexican Government
                            and, in such instances as the Embassy has reported upon, it has
                            satisfactorily cleaned up the intervened companies in accordance with
                            the conditions outlined in the Ambassador’s memorandum. The informal
                            conversations at the Foreign Office have not only surprised, but, in
                            many cases, amazed the representatives of the Embassy with respect to
                            the thoroughness with which the Junta Administrativa has fulfilled its
                            undertaking that the intervened companies be thoroughly purged of
                            undesirables so that they could be removed from the Proclaimed List. Not
                            only has the Junta Administrativa intervened in those companies
                            suggested by the Embassy, but, it went much further and intervened in
                            additional companies which, after investigation, it found had Axis
                            connections. A further indication of the thoroughness of the purge is
                            found in the fact that, upon its own initiative, the Junta intervened
                            the properties and other assets of original owners and employees of
                            intervened firms. In addition, it has been established to the
                            satisfaction of the Embassy that accounts of intervened firms and
                            individuals which have been blocked in the Bank of Mexico are
                            effectively frozen and an extensive vigilance is exercised by the Junta
                            over the needs and mode of living of blocked persons. These are facts
                            which should not be overlooked in determining whether or not the
                            intervened firms recommended for deletion by the Embassy should be taken
                            from the Proclaimed List. In those cases in which deletion is
                            recommended to the Department, the Embassy is satisfied that the
                            purposes and intent of the Proclaimed List have been completely
                            fulfilled and that delay in removing such names from the List will serve
                            no other purpose than to thwart the global settlement and bring ill will
                            into our relationships.</p>
                        <p>Embassy despatch No. 8754 of March 27, 1943, informed the Department that
                            the Mexican Government considers that the ownership and title to
                            property of the intervened companies rest in the Mexican Government and
                            that the former owners of the properties have no right therein. Embassy
                            despatch No. 9464 of April 22, 1943,<note n="32" xml:id="d414fn32">Not
                                printed.</note> gave a very detailed description of operations and
                            procedures of the Junta Administrativa,<pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494"
                                facs="0508"/>as well as the system of management and inspection
                            installed in each intervened company. The speeding up of action on the
                            part of the Junta Administrativa in preparing the intervened companies
                            for deletion was the result of the global plan presented in the
                            Ambassador’s memorandum of August 10, 1942. As the Mexican Government is
                            fulfilling its part of the agreement in reference to the intervened
                            companies, the Department is urged to bring to the attention of the
                            Inter-Departmental Committee the character of the Ambassador’s proposal
                            to the Foreign Office as set forth in his memorandum of August 10, 1942,
                            which was accepted in good faith by the Mexican Government, and the
                            necessity for prompt consideration and action on such recommendations as
                            the Embassy submits in accordance with that proposal.</p>
                        <p>As of April 29, the Embassy has recommended the deletion of seventeen
                            intervened firms. These recommendations were contained in despatches
                            Nos. 9464 and 9600 of April 22 and April 26 respectively,<note n="33"
                                xml:id="d414fn33">Neither printed.</note> and other despatches now
                            under preparation for immediate forwarding to the Department. It is
                            extremely important that the deletions mentioned in these despatches be
                            cleared in time for publication on May 10. Each one of these
                            recommendations has been studied and compiled in detail and it is
                            believed that the Mexican Government should be encouraged by the
                            appearance of the deletions. The companies in question have been cleaned
                            up to the satisfaction of the Embassy and there remains no doubt but
                            that the purposes of the Proclaimed List have been fulfilled.</p>
                        <p>Relative to List II, or, the list which contains names which the Embassy
                            feels can be safely deleted as the intervened firms are removed, it is
                            felt that no useful purpose can be served in quibbling with the Mexican
                            Government concerning their deletion. When the intervened companies are
                            deleted from the Proclaimed List, it will mean that the most important
                            elements have been removed. The large and dangerous Axis companies and
                            organizations will have been placed under the ownership and operation of
                            the Mexican Government. A very large percentage of the names upon List
                            No. II are there because they dealt with or acted on behalf of the
                            intervened companies. Most of the persons on List No. II are Mexicans,
                            and, legally speaking, they had a legal right to perform any business
                            transactions within the Republic of Mexico which are not prohibited by
                            Mexican law. This means that they had a legal right from the Mexican
                            viewpoint to negotiate with a firm upon the Proclaimed List. Most of the
                            persons on List No. II were not malicious in intent nor was there any
                            indication that they were pro-Axis or anti-American. They were simply
                            Mexican citizens conducting business within <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495"
                                facs="0509"/>the Republic of Mexico. With the disappearance of the
                            intervened companies from the Proclaimed List, it is believed that the
                            names on List No. II can be safely deleted from the Proclaimed List and
                            that was the understanding with the Mexican Government. Any additional
                            information which the Department might desire concerning any names upon
                            List No. II will be forwarded on request, but, the Department is urged,
                            again, to use its best efforts to convince the Inter-Departmental
                            Committee that List No. II should be removed from the Proclaimed
                            List.</p>
                        <p>It will require approximately three weeks before our informal discussions
                            at the Foreign Office will bring to a conclusion the study of all of the
                            intervened firms. It is hoped that our recommendations on all intervened
                            firms will be forwarded to the Department in time for publication on
                            June 10. In the meantime, discussions are also under way concerning
                            additions to the Proclaimed List. It is now necessary for us to consult
                            not only with our British colleague, but with the Foreign Office before
                            any recommendations for additions can be made. The Embassy believes that
                            no additions to the Proclaimed List should be published on May 10.
                            Beginning with June 10, the remaining twenty-nine additions agreed upon
                            at the time Mr. Russell<note n="34" xml:id="d414fn34">Francis H.
                                Russell, Assistant Chief of the Division of World Trade

                            addition since that time, can safely be published in reasonable
                            installments until this phase of the matter might be fully taken care
                            of. It is very important that in the publication of May 10 very few, if
                            any, additions appear.</p>
                        <p>The importance of a global settlement of Proclaimed List problems in
                            Mexico, as set forth by the Ambassador in his despatch No. 3415 of
                            August 19, 1942, is so great that the Embassy has been very explicit in
                            this despatch in making its recommendations to the Department as to what
                            procedure it believes would best serve the interests of the two
                            Governments involved. The Department can have the fullest assurance that
                            every detail of the discussions between the Foreign Office and the
                            Embassy, as well as each individual recommendation, is receiving the
                            careful and weighed consideration of the Ambassador and his staff.</p>

                        <p>A–1075. The receipt is acknowledged of the Department’s airgram A–1590 of
                            April 26, 11:50 a.m. referring to the Embassy’s despatch No. 9054 of
                            April 9, 1943,<note n="35" xml:id="d415fn35">Neither printed.</note> and
                            stating that certain serious questions have been raised with respect to
                            the plan for management of the proposed Mexican national chemical
                            industry by the American Cyanamid Company.</p>
                        <p>Prior to the receipt of the Department’s airgram under acknowledgement,
                            the Embassy forwarded its despatch No. 9463 of April 22, 1943, which
                            gives in detail the Embassy’s views on many of the questions raised in
                            the Department’s communication, and which transmitted a copy of an
                            agreement between the Mexican Government and the American Cyanamid
                            Company to enter into a contract after certain conditions have been
                            fulfilled. The contract embodies, therefore, in a definite form the
                            results of the negotiations that have been carried on thus far by the
                            American firm and the Mexican Government.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Department’s request for information on those points
                            not already covered in the Embassy’s despatch just mentioned, it is the
                            Embassy’s opinion, based on conversations with the representatives of
                            the American Cyanamid Company that it is the intention of the operating
                            company in the proposed plan to supply Mexican requirements of drugs and
                            chemicals not only by importations from abroad, but also by
                            manufacturing on a substantial scale such products as are in demand in
                            the Mexican market. The Mexican Government, it is understood, will
                            provide the necessary capital for the construction of any manufacturing
                            facilities that are deemed desirable. There is nothing definite, so far
                            as the Embassy is aware, with regard to plans for plant extension but
                            additional plant facilities are provided for in the program. They will
                            be subject, of course, to the limitations of war conditions.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the Department’s suggestion that the Embassy make inquiry
                            whether the Mexican Government would be receptive to an alternative
                            proposal, the Embassy is of the opinion that it would be highly
                            undesirable to approach the Mexican Government at this time, as the
                            Department suggests, since the negotiations have hitherto been carried
                            on between the Mexican Government and the American firm on a strictly
                            private basis. If the Embassy were to intervene to the extent of
                            inquiring whether or not the Mexican Government would be receptive to an
                            alternative proposal, it is felt that this action would <pb n="497"
                                xml:id="pg_497" facs="0511"/>be interpreted by the Mexican
                            Government as indicating that the American Government was displeased or
                            dissatisfied with the agreements that have so far been reached with the
                            American firm and thus would definitely suspend all further
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the proposal, mentioned in the first paragraph of the
                            Department’s communication, that the American Government undertake to
                            furnish the Mexican Government with such technical assistance as it will
                            need for the consummation of plans for the development of a national
                            chemical industry, the Embassy is of the opinion that the desires of the
                            Mexican Government to establish a chemical industry, using as a basis
                            the German firms in which it has intervened, could best be realized with
                            the assistance of private American concerns qualified to provide
                            technical assistance in all its forms. In an industry comprising many
                            technical ramifications, this assistance would be of vital importance
                            and an absolute necessity in the case of operation directly or
                            indirectly by the Government. The Embassy has felt, therefore, that
                            plans for the operation of such an industry in Mexico could best be
                            carried on by private enterprise in cooperation with the Mexican
                            Government, rather than on a basis of Government to Government.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has noted with considerable interest the contents of
                            paragraph 6 of the Department’s airgram relating to trade marks and
                            patents. As pointed out in the Embassy’s despatch, it is the intention
                            of the Mexican Government to turn over its proprietary interest in these
                            trade marks and patents to the Government-owned company to be formed. It
                            has also been stated to officers of the Embassy, who are currently
                            carrying on conferences with officials of the Foreign Office on
                            Proclaimed List matters, that the Mexican Government had taken over with
                            the seized enemy properties those trade marks and patents belonging to
                            the intervened firms and that a study was being “made of the most
                            desirable procedure to follow with respect to patents and trademarks
                            which are owned by German interests in Germany and used on a royalty
                            basis by the intervened firms. Article 3 of the contract, transmitted to
                            the Department with the Embassy’s despatch No. 9463 of April 22, 1943,
                            specifies among other things that all patents and copyrights are to be
                            transferred to the Government-owned corporation along with other assets
                            and properties of the intervened firms.</p>
                        <p>It was the opinion of the Embassy officials that the seizure by the
                            Mexican Government of German trade marks and patents would constitute
                            another bastion in the ownership of the properties seized by the Mexican
                            Government and would make more unlikely the return of the seized
                            properties to the original owners after the war. As expressed
                            informally, Mexican officials have said, with respect <pb n="498"
                                xml:id="pg_498" facs="0512"/>to German trade marks and patents, “Why
                            destroy them, why not use them?”</p>
                        <p>The Embassy will await a further instruction from the Department after it
                            has taken into consideration the Embassy’s comment as submitted in
                            despatch No. 9463 of April 22, 1943.</p>

                        <p>744. Your despatch 9463, April 22, 1943 and Department’s A–1590, April

                        <p>Department has discussed with other interested Government agencies and
                            American Cyanamid the proposal and contracts. Your opinion is requested
                            on the merits of the following points: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>It is asserted by Cyanamid that officials of the Mexican
                                    Government resent the supposed delay occasioned by
                                    “interference” of the American Government in matters which are
                                    considered primarily to affect Mexican interests. It has been
                                    suggested that the Mexicans believe that the Department is
                                    primarily interested in preventing a violation of the Mexican
                                    monopoly laws. Please indicate whether this is the Mexican
                                    attitude, and, if so, on what this attitude is based. You may
                                    deem it appropriate to indicate that we will not attempt either
                                    to interpret or enforce Mexican monopoly laws.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>It has been suggested by Cyanamid that the Mexicans desire
                                    immediate action, and that they will either sign the proposed
                                    contracts within the next week or 10 days or abandon entirely
                                    their nationalization program for the drug and chemical
                                    industry. Please indicate specifically your opinion of the
                                    necessary time schedule on the American Cyanamid proposal and
                                    whether the Mexicans are likely to abandon all attempts at
                                    nationalization should the proposal either be turned down or be
                                    delayed more than a week or two. Colonel Pope has stated that he
                                    was requested to return for final signing of papers on May 15,
                                    1943.</item>

                                    program for the Mexican drug and chemical industry. In the
                                    absence of prior consultation with the Mexicans, the Custodian’s
                                    program is necessarily in a developmental stage. The Custodian
                                    believes, however, that a plan might be worked out involving
                                    participation not only by companies under his control but also
                                    by other American drug and chemical companies, whose aid might
                                    be valuable. Should the <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0513"

                                    Custodian, the Custodian would be willing to send

                                    this offer on the part of the Custodian should be transmitted to
                                    the Mexicans. It should be clearly indicated that the Department
                                    is interested only in extending all possible cooperation to the
                                    Mexican Government, for the purpose of procuring the best
                                    possible program.</item>

                            consideration of them here. Please indicate the reaction of the Mexican

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Dean</hi>: As you know, the American Cyanamid
                            people have been down here talking with the Mexican Government for some
                            months about an arrangement through which the American Cyanamid would
                            take over certain operating work for the Mexican Government in
                            connection with some of the chemical and drug firms taken over by the
                            Mexican Government from the German firms under our proclaimed list
                            practice and that of the Mexicans. I will not go into detail with regard
                            to these arrangements because our despatches and letters to the
                            Department cover the situation from here and I know that the Department
                            has been giving careful consideration to this matter as indicated by its
                            telegrams to us.</p>
                        <p>The arrangements have reached the point where the American Cyanamid and
                            the Mexican Government are on the point of signing a contract but the
                            American Cyanamid does not feel that it can do so if our Government
                            raises any objection. We have now a telegram from the Department<note
                                n="38" xml:id="d417fn38">Presumably No. 744, <hi rend="italic"
                                    >supra.</hi></note> to the effect that the alien property
                            custodian would be willing to enter into certain conversations with the
                            Mexican authorities to the end that he and we would be willing to lend
                            our collaboration. I am authorized by the telegram to make this
                            suggestion to the Mexican Government if I see fit. Bursley, Lockett and
                            I have gone into this matter very carefully from time to time and again
                            on the basis of the last telegram which we had yesterday. We are all of
                            the opinion very definitely that it would be inadvisable to take up this
                            matter with the Mexican Government in the <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500"
                                facs="0514"/>form suggested in the telegram. It would be equivalent
                            in one way or another, directly or indirectly, in [<hi rend="italic"
                                >to</hi>] our going into business with the Mexicans in this drug and
                            chemical field and I know that the Mexicans would not wish this and I
                            feel sure that they would resent the suggestion. Although they have not
                            said anything to us directly, we know indirectly that they are not happy
                            or at least that the American Cyanamid has had to submit all of its
                            arrangements to our Government. There are those in the Mexican
                            Government who believe that this is equivalent to our interfering in an
                            internal Mexican affair. We have made it clear to the Mexican
                            authorities and I am sure the responsible ones understand that our only
                            interest was from the point of view of the American Cyanamid Company
                            which could not enter into any arrangement as an American company which
                            would be found objectionable to our Government as it would cause
                            difficulties for the American Cyanamid at home. They thoroughly
                            understand this now.</p>
                        <p>So far as we can see there is nothing monopolistic involved in the
                            arrangements which the American Cyanamid is entering into with the
                            Mexican authorities. I think from our point of view it is a very
                            desirable arrangement for it is the only sure and definite way that I
                            see that we will definitely eliminate these German firms from the drug
                            and chemical business in Mexico in which they are so strong. The Mexican
                            Government of course during the war has undertaken to rim and is
                            operating these companies independently of the former German owners but
                            these firms are difficult to run and require technical and
                            administrative personnel which it is difficult to furnish from here
                            alone. There is a possibility that if the Mexicans run them on their own
                            that at the end of the war in some way or other these firms may get back
                            into the hands of the Germans whether the Mexican Government would push
                            it or not.</p>
                        <p>If the American Cyanamid comes in under the contract, of which the
                            Department has a copy,<note n="39" xml:id="d417fn39">Not printed.</note>
                            they will be able to see that these firms run successfully. This will
                            definitely assure the elimination of the Germans from this important
                            drug and chemical field. It is therefore 100% to our advantage.</p>
                        <p>I can see that there are certain American drug firms at home which may be
                            bringing pressures on the Department because they fear monopolistic
                            practices, etc. For some of these drug firms, which I believe are
                            bringing this pressure, I have no sympathy whatever for they were
                            willing to play with the Germans up until the last minute and probably
                            would be willing to play with them again if they had a chance. I can not
                            see myself anything dangerous to our own drug firms in the proposed
                            arrangement.</p>

                        <p>One thing is sure and that is if we try to open this question with the
                            Mexicans of the alien property custodian entering into the picture, the
                            Mexicans will resent it and we will not be able to make any progress. If
                            we press an arrangement such as the one the alien property custodian has
                            in mind, the arrangement with the American Cyanamid will break down and
                            we will have confusion and the probability that we will only be creating
                            a problem for ourselves in the drug and chemical field at the end of the
                            war.</p>
                        <p>I am sending you herewith a copy of a despatch with which is transmitted

                            that you inform us or the American Cyanamid that our Government has no
                            objection to the American Cyanamid entering into this contract. I think
                            this should be done without delay as any delay will not do us any good

                            consider us as having sabotaged it when they entered into it in all good
                            faith and have tried to act in good faith and I believe have done so and
                            when they have been definitely under the impression that our Government
                            saw no reason why they should not consider such an arrangement with the

                        <p>After a very careful rereading of the file with regard to the proposed
                            American Cyanamid deal with Mexico I feel constrained to express very
                            great doubt as to the desirability of giving this project this
                            Government’s blessing until other alternatives have been more thoroughly
                            explored.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe that any careful study of this project can fail but
                            reach the conclusion that it embodies strong monopolistic implications.
                            Whatever may be the paper guarantees, the setup would be such that the
                            American Cyanamid Company would be in a position <pb n="502"
                                xml:id="pg_502" facs="0516"/>effectively to prevent other United
                            States drug and chemical concerns from selling their products on any
                            important scale in the Mexican market.</p>
                        <p>I am unwilling to admit that there is no other alternative than this
                            arrangement. In addition, I do not think that delay will really remove
                            the possibility of closing either the pending deal or a deal based upon
                            the same setup provided that after further exploration this seems to be
                            the only feasible procedure to take. It seems possible that American
                            Cyanamid might become annoyed and withdraw, but the deal is so favorable
                            to the United States group involved that I feel confident others would
                            come forward and gladly take the place of the American Cyanamid
                            Company.</p>
                        <p>As a preliminary step I recommend that the Department assemble a meeting
                            of the United States Government agencies involved and request their
                            assistance in canvassing intensively other possibilities of assistance
                            to Mexico in this matter. Once these possibilities have been developed
                            in outline stage then the authorities of the Mexican Government could be
                            informed of them and asked whether they would like to explore them with
                            us in a Government-to-Government discussion.</p>
                        <p>In résumé, I do not believe that the Department should permit itself to
                            be high-pressured into approving a project on the basis that it is “the
                            only one” when the situation is not one that requires precipitate
                            action. I think that the long-run disadvantages outweigh the immediate
                            advantages, particularly when the immediate needs are not such as to
                            require decision within a fortnight or a month. I believe that the
                            Department should have the benefit of a more careful exploration before
                            it decides on any proposal.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Duggan’s memorandum of May 22 refers to the monopolistic implications
                            of the Cyanamid deal and suggests the desirability of exploring other
                            alternatives with the other interested agencies. In this connection, it
                            should be observed that for several months we have been in close touch
                            with the Department of Justice and BEW, with a view to developing a
                            preferable and workable alternative. The Department of Justice at one
                            time suggested a Government corporation, but Assistant Attorney General
                            Cox in a meeting with Mr. Acheson indicated that because of the coolness
                            of BEW, which would <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0517"/>have to
                            direct the formation of the corporation, he was doubtful that the
                            corporation could be organized in time to deal with the Mexican
                            situation. For this reason and other reasons which I spelled out in my
                            memorandum of April 2<note n="42" xml:id="d419fn42">Not found in
                                Department files.</note> I do not believe that the use of any
                            Government corporation not yet organized would be a feasible alternative
                            to the Cyanamid proposal. The only other “alternative” is the nebulous
                            suggestion of the APC,<note n="43" xml:id="d419fn43">Alien Property
                                Custodian.</note> which Mr. Messersmith declined to convey to the
                            Mexicans. I do not believe, for the reasons given below, that we should
                            risk effective action against the Axis properties in Mexico in order to
                            press the APC’s proposal—or more realistically, his desire to begin
                            negotiating an arrangement with the Mexicans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Duggan speaks with great generality about alternatives, presumably
                            alternatives without monopolistic implications. The experience of the
                            last three months has revealed the difficulty of formulating any
                            practicable alternative, monopolistic or not. Moreover, analysis of the
                            Mexican situation reveals the difficulties in the way of formulating
                            non-monopolistic alternatives, or, more accurately, alternatives which
                            will promote a free competitive market. Nationalization of a large
                            segment of an industry and its operation under Government sponsorship
                            necessarily involves a dominant position for the nationalized company
                            and the elimination of some competition. The nationalized company will
                            have a controlling position in distribution in Mexico. This will obtain
                            irrespective of whether Cyanamid manages the nationalized properties.
                            However, this distribution “monopoly” is essentially Mexico’s business.
                            Our concern may properly be focussed on the desirability of giving
                            Cyanamid a controlling position on the supply side. However, given a
                            concentrated distribution system and the desire of the Mexicans for
                            management by a United States company or companies which manufacture
                            chemicals, it is difficult to formulate proposals for management of the
                            Mexican company by private United States companies which make a
                            significant difference in terms of competition. Thus let us assume that
                            four American companies agreed to assume the management of the
                            nationalized companies. They probably would agree to a division of
                            fields on the supply side and we would have more units in the management
                            corporation but not significantly more competition. Indeed the
                            substitution of three or four large chemical concerns for Cyanamid might
                            well create greater difficulties for <hi rend="italic">outsiders</hi>.
                            For example, let us assume that the management group was to consist of
                            Dupont, Allied, General Aniline and Cyanamid. In that case,
                            non-participating firms seeking access to the Mexican market might be
                            faced with the added difficulties of bucking a combination of four
                            Cyanamids.</p>
                        <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0518"/>
                        <p>Moreover, the multiplication of American companies participating in the
                            management of the Mexican companies would necessarily involve a dilution
                            of responsibility for management. The Mexicans may with justification
                            prefer the concentration of responsibility in a single company to a
                            business analogue of an interdepartmental committee.</p>
                        <p>It should be added that an “alternative” to be acceptable to the Mexicans
                            who have been negotiating for eight months must be something more
                            concrete than a general exhortation against monopoly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Duggan concludes that American Cyanamid would be in a position
                            effectively to prevent other drug and chemical concerns from selling
                            their products on any important scale in Mexico. I am afraid that I
                            cannot accept this ipse dixit. Many of the products which will be
                            required by Mexico, Cyanamid does not produce and must acquire through
                            American firms. It is true that many United States companies, if they
                            sell, will have to sell through the nationalized distribution company.
                            But this would be true irrespective of whether or not Cyanamid
                            participated. It is also true that Cyanamid may use its dominant
                            position in the distribution plan to exact concessions in other markets
                            from the American suppliers. I believe that in this field we can expect
                            some help from the Antitrust Division. Moreover, I must express some
                            fear concerning the Department’s disapproval of an arrangement that per
                            se violates no law—on the basis of a prejudgment that the anti-monopoly
                            laws will be violated.</p>
                        <p>The gains from further delays and further search for alternatives are
                            extremely conjectural. The risks of such a course are substantial.</p>

                                unwillingness to assist in the establishment of a local Mexican

                            <item>I take it that any approach to the Mexican Government would
                                necessarily indicate that we could present alternatives which would
                                be superior means of achieving the Mexican objectives. In view of
                                the inchoate nature of these alternatives I believe that such
                                representations would be dangerous if not irresponsible. They would
                                involve implied governmental commitments which we might not be able
                                to redeem. They would involve a continuing responsibility for the
                                development of the Mexican chemical industry which I do not <pb
                                    n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0519"/>believe we should assume. I
                                am concerned that our advice to the Mexicans may outdistance our
                                wisdom.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I do not believe that the Department is being high-pressured into action
                            in this case. The case has been carefully considered here. It has been
                            carefully considered by other agencies. If there are realistic
                            alternatives, three months of thought should have produced them. I
                            believe that we should meet with the other agencies and see whether
                            there are alternatives which we have overlooked. Absent such
                            alternatives, I believe that we will gain nothing by further delay.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it is not proposed to give any affirmative blessing to the deal
                            but merely to avoid any objection and to couple this with a statement to
                            the Mexicans that we assume no responsibility for effective performance
                            by Cyanamid.</p>

                        <p>The proposed contract between the Mexican Government and the American
                            Cyanamid Company was brought to your attention by Mr. Biddle’s
                            memorandum of May 26, 1943.<note n="44" xml:id="d420fn44">Not printed;
                                it recommended a plan of the Alien Property Custodian as a guarantee
                                against monopoly and against the return of German control
                                (812.-659/63).</note> The matter, which for some time has been
                            carefully studied by the interested agencies, was fully discussed on
                            June 3, 1943 during a meeting of the full Board of Economic Warfare,
                            attended by Mr. Crowley. The interested agencies have agreed to present
                            the following recommendations to you: Despite objections to the Cyanamid
                            arrangements, which have troubled all of us, the Mexican Government
                            should be informed that we will not place any obstacle in the way of the
                            Cyanamid deal. At the same time, Mr. Crowley’s offer should be presented
                            to the Mexicans.</p>
                        <p>The reasons for this decision are largely political in character. We are
                            concerned that disapproval of the Cyanamid deal would be interpreted by
                            the Mexicans as gringo interference and would provoke charges of
                            non-performance of our promises to assist in Mexico’s replacement
                            problems. But the strongest reason is the fear, shared by all of us,
                            that disapproval—after protracted negotiations between Cyanamid and the
                            Mexicans—will lead to the abandonment of effective Mexican action with
                            respect to Axis businesses. This development would not only jeopardize
                            important war objectives but would also facilitate the post-war
                            re-emergence of German economic domination in Mexico.</p>
                        <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0520"/>
                        <p>It does not seem likely that the Cyanamid arrangements will set a pattern
                            for the other American republics. In those countries in which
                            replacement plans are developing—for example, Brazil and Colombia—the
                            trend has been toward individual reorganizations and not toward big
                            combinations. These other American republics are afraid of concentrated
                            economic power and do not have the Mexican tendency toward large,
                            state-controlled enterprises.</p>
                        <p>Since Mr. Crowley’s companies can be instruments of governmental
                            policies, it seems desirable to bring his offer formally to the
                            attention of the Mexicans. As indicated in the instruction to Ambassador
                            Messersmith, Mr. Crowley’s proposal seems preferable to Cyanamid’s since
                            his companies can wage economic warfare without a private company’s
                            concern for its stockholders interests. However, in order to avoid
                            suggesting Mr. Crowley’s proposal in a manner which might be considered
                            coercive by the Mexicans, it appears best to couple the counterproposal
                            with a statement of “no objection” to the Mexican-Cyanamid plans.</p>
                        <p>I am attaching a proposed instruction to Ambassador Messersmith and note
                            for transmittal to the Mexicans,<note n="45" xml:id="d420fn45">Note not

                            performance by Cyanamid and points specifically to the antimonopoly
                            clause in the proposed contract. The note has been drafted with a view
                            to meeting any domestic criticism which may develop and to giving us a
                            basis for protesting to the Mexicans should the operations under the
                            Cyanamid contract actually involve restraints on trade.</p>

                            Department that the American Cyanamid Company had decided to withdraw
                            from the proposed contract <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0521"/>with
                            the Mexican Government under which Cyanamid would take over the
                            management of the vested drug and chemical companies in Mexico. He
                            stated that this decision was the result of newspaper articles
                            indicating that the various agencies in Washington were not in agreement
                            that the deal should be approved. He mentioned in particular a news item
                            in the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald Tribune</hi> which stated that
                            President Roosevelt had been asked to arbitrate a dispute between the
                            State Department on the one side and the Board of Economic Warfare and
                            the Alien Property Custodian on the other as to whether the vested
                            companies should be taken over and operated by American Cyanamid as a
                            practical monopoly.</p>
                        <p>He continued that the company didn’t have confidence in undertaking the
                            management contract under the circumstances, although it felt that the
                            opposition in certain Government agencies was not a reflection on the
                            company but rather that there was a conflict of opinion as to the
                            desirability of the whole project. As an example he referred to the
                            conflict on the question of trade-marks, saying that it seemed obvious
                            to Cyanamid that the trade-marks should be utilized from the viewpoint
                            of the business in Mexico. He added, however, that the company had been
                            advised that objection had been made to one of the trade-marks being
                            purchased by an American company and that that company had had to spend
                            a great deal of money to establish a new mark.</p>
                        <p>He stated that the company felt that going forward with the deal would be
                            bad both for the Cyanamid company and for the Mexicans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Meltzer replied that there were several things in Mr. Hammett’s
                            statement that he would like to comment on. The first was the trademark
                            policy which is one of the more complex problems. He indicated that the
                            only thing that has been agreed on in Washington so far is that,
                            although certain general objectives could be established, these would
                            have to be adjusted so as to meet the requirements of specific cases;
                            that it was recognized here that the attitude of the local Government
                            might in many cases prevent withdrawal of the marks. He added that he
                            didn’t know who had pretended to speak for the Government on the
                            trade-mark policy or what specific company Cyanamid had in mind. He
                            pointed out that there were several companies which have been subject to
                            certain disabilities in connection with consent decrees entered into at
                            a time when the picture in Latin America was quite different from what
                            it is now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Meltzer stated that all he could say about the general situation was
                            that he would take up the matter of Cyanamid’s withdrawal with the other
                            interested people.</p>
                        <p>He inquired whether Cyanamid was planning to get in touch with the
                            Mexicans. Mr. Hammett replied that Cyanamid felt that it must <pb
                                n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0522"/>inform the Mexican Government.
                            He added that he didn’t think that the decision that Cyanamid had made
                            was different from the decision that the Mexicans would want since if
                            Cyanamid couldn’t go into the deal with confidence it was better from
                            the standpoint of the Mexicans as well that Cyanamid withdraw
                            completely.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Meltzer inquired whether it would be possible to hold off informing
                            the Mexicans for a few days. Mr. Hammett replied that he could see no
                            reason why that wouldn’t be all right. He added, however, that if Mr.
                            Garfías should get in touch with Cyanamid, it would be necessary to
                            answer any direct questions which he might ask.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Meltzer observed that it was unfortunate that Cyanamid had gotten its
                            ideas of the government’s attitude from newspapers accounts. Mr. Hammett
                            pointed out that the Cyanamid position was not based entirely on
                            newspaper articles. He said that Cyanamid realized that newspaper
                            reports do not necessarily reflect facts exactly but, on the other hand,
                            there is generally some factual basis for them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Meltzer stated in conclusion that he would call Mr. Hammett within
                            the next few days.</p>

                            to Mr. Acheson. Attached are a copy of a letter which President
                            Roosevelt himself is sending to President Camacho<note n="49"
                                xml:id="d422fn49"><hi rend="italic">Infra.</hi></note> and a draft
                            note to be submitted to the Mexican Foreign Office.<note n="50"
                                xml:id="d422fn50">Not printed.</note> You are requested promptly to
                            put the enclosed note in appropriate form and to transmit it to the
                            appropriate officials of the Mexican Government.</p>
                        <p>The issues raised by the proposed Cyanamid contract have been carefully
                            considered by the interested governmental agencies and by the President.
                            There has been special concern about the dominant position in the
                            Mexican chemical and pharmaceutical industry which would be accorded to
                            American Cyanamid Company if the proposed contract were executed. It has
                            also been felt that an arrangement between the Mexican Government and
                            the Alien Property Custodian along the lines suggested in the attached
                            note would avoid difficulties which might arise from the Cyanamid
                            arrangements and would be more advantageous to the Mexicans and to our
                            economic warfare <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0523"/>program. In
                            view of these considerations, the President directed that his letter to
                            President Camacho and the attached note to the Foreign Office be
                            transmitted.</p>
                        <p>You should, in your conversations with the Mexican Government, emphasize
                            the desire of this Government to work out an arrangement which will
                            promote the best interests of the Mexican economy and the belief of this
                            Government that the program outlined by the Alien Property Custodian
                            affords a basis for achieving that objective.</p>
                        <p>Please send to the Department as soon as possible a copy of the note as
                            transmitted to the Mexican Government, and please keep the Department
                            promptly informed of all pertinent developments.</p>

                            the enemy-owned chemical and pharmaceutical companies in Mexico. I
                            understand that you plan to use these companies in connection with a
                            program which is directed at the development of a nationalized drug and
                            chemical industry, the expansion of your own domestic production, and
                            the training of Mexicans to run that industry independently. I
                            understand further that we in the United States, by furnishing certain
                            management skills, technical services and supplies, could make a
                            definite contribution to the success of this project. I am anxious to
                            extend all possible assistance to your program because I consider it to
                            be of great importance both to the economy of Mexico and the security of
                            this hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Leo Crowley, our Alien Property Custodian, has expressed to me his
                            desire to place the facilities of his companies at your disposal. He has
                            described to me a program involving the use of those facilities, which,
                            he believes, could make a solid contribution to the success of <pb
                                n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0524"/>your plans. I too believe that
                            he could be of real service. I have accordingly asked Ambassador
                            Messersmith to present Mr. Crowley’s proposal to the appropriate members
                            of your Government.</p>
                        <p>I have emphasized to Mr. Crowley that I wish him to be prepared to extend
                            his fullest cooperation to you in the achievement of your objectives.
                            Moreover, I have instructed him that the companies under his custody are
                            to be used in the broad interests of your general program. You will
                            appreciate that I am not in a position to issue such an instruction to a
                            private American corporation.</p>
                        <p>I fully recognize that arrangements for the management and development of
                            the Mexican chemical industry are matters for your determination. I wish
                            merely to emphasize my belief that the Alien Property Custodian, because
                            of the status of his companies as publicly-owned corporations, could
                            effectively promote the welfare of the Mexican industry. Accordingly, I
                            hope that you will consider the proposal of the Alien Property Custodian
                            before reaching any final decision in the matter.</p>
                        <p>I am communicating with you in this personal way rather than through
                            official channels because I am confident that in matters of this kind
                            you would agree with me that it is more helpful to us both to
                            communicate with one another in this direct and personal manner.</p>
                        <p>May I say again how much I valued the conversations I had with you during
                            our recent meetings and how truly beneficial I feel they have been to
                            me. I am looking forward to carrying out the plans you were kind enough
                            to suggest to me and I hope that I may therefore have the opportunity of
                            seeing you again before many months have passed.</p>
                        <p>With the assurances of my highest consideration and of my warm personal
                            regard, believe me</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Messersmith has telephoned from Mexico City. He has received
                            the instruction recently approved by you, directing him to deliver to
                            President Avila Camacho your letter regarding the Alien Property
                            Custodian’s proposal to furnish management services for the Mexican drug
                            and chemical companies and to deliver to the Mexican Government the note
                            containing the Alien Property Custodian’s proposal. The Ambassador will,
                            of course, carry out <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0525"/>these
                            instructions. He has requested that, before these documents are
                            delivered, I lay before you the following expressions of his
                            opinion:</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador has been informed by Señor Garfías that the American
                            Cyanamid Company will withdraw its proposal to enter into a contract
                            with the Mexican Government. He believes that, instead of proceeding
                            along this line, the Mexican Government wishes to work out a management
                            arrangement with a group of American companies.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador believes that the Mexican authorities would not wish to
                            enter into a contractual arrangement with a company which had been
                            formerly controlled by the Germans.</p>
                        <p>He believes further that the Mexican authorities would not favor a
                            management arrangement made through an agency of this Government. He
                            says that he understands that two members of the committee in charge of
                            this matter in Mexico have so declared.</p>
                        <p>He believes that the proposal would be embarrassing to the President of
                            Mexico, since the Ambassador believes that President Avila Camacho would
                            not be able to accede to the proposal, and yet will find it most
                            difficult to refuse the proposal endorsed by the President of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Ambassador expresses the opinion that the proposal may
                            result in no action being taken, with the result that after some lapse
                            of time companies may find their way into private hands, and the
                            replacement program may be prejudiced.</p>
                        <p>It was explained to the Ambassador that most of the points which he
                            raised were canvassed by the agencies which have participated in the
                            consideration of this matter and in the preparation of the memoranda for
                            your consideration. However, he urges strongly that his views be
                            presented to you. I presume that you will wish the instruction to stand
                            and wish me so to inform the Ambassador.</p>

                                    that it will not change its attitude in this respect.</item>

                                <item>An undertaking such as that requested by the Interdepartmental
                                    Committee would constitute a duplication of existing laws of
                                    Mexico which prohibit trading with enemy aliens and persons
                                    classed as such, and would place the Mexican Government in the
                                    embarrassing position of requiring it to obtain from its own
                                    citizens statements to the effect that such citizens would obey
                                    the laws of Mexico.</item>

                                        Government in his memorandum of August 10, 1942. It is
                                        believed that Mexicans would take position that our
                                        Government, under terms of that agreement, is not justified

                                        indicated its disagreement and therefore the introduction of
                                        such discussions would result in disadvantages far
                                        outweighing any advantage or benefits which might be derived
                                        from the undertakings.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>This matter has been fully discussed with the British Consul General in
                            Mexico who is in complete accord with our viewpoint that these
                            undertakings are inadvisable and unnecessary. The Embassy is asking the
                            Foreign Office, however, for its cooperation in informing Mexican firms
                            which have been intervened not to have any transactions with Proclaimed
                            List firms and individuals outside of Mexico in international
                            transactions.</p>

                                    explanation that the action decided on is wholly up to the
                                    decision of the Mexican Government and that we are not trying to
                                    force anything down their throats.</p>

                                Roosevelt, <ref target="#pg_510">p. 510</ref>.</note> with regard to

                            June 28. I now have the Department’s telegram No. 1078, of July 2, 9
                            p.m., to the effect that this matter has been discussed with the
                            President and that he desires me to deliver the letter to President

                                xml:id="pg_514" facs="0528"/>acceptable manner possible this morning

                            were very reserved in their attitude, as I felt they were sure to be,
                            but I presented the matter in the most effective manner possible and I
                            feel that they will at least be prepared to see a representative of the
                            Alien Property Custodian in due course, to go into this matter further,
                            for they will unquestionably want further details before reaching any
                            decision. What their ultimate decision will be after discussing the
                            matter with a representative of the Alien Property Custodian, I cannot
                            foresee, but I do believe that on July 12 there is now a possibility
                            that I will be informed that they will at least be prepared to discuss
                            the matter with a representative of the Alien Property Custodian.</p>
                        <p>Please assure the President that in view of his desire that I present
                            this matter, I have done so and have done so in the most effective
                            manner that I could. I will keep the Department informed of any
                            developments.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to this
                            Embassy’s Airgram No. 1541 dated July 2, 1943 at 11 a.m. which
                            recommends that our Government not require individuals now included on
                            the Proclaimed List to give an undertaking as a condition precedent to
                            their deletion therefrom. Reference is also made to this Embassy’s
                            despatch No. 11212 dated July 8 [<hi rend="italic">10</hi>], 1943<note
                                n="59" xml:id="d428fn59">Not printed.</note> stating that on July 7,
                            1943 a conference on Proclaimed List matters was held between Sr.
                            Cordoba of the Foreign Office, Ingeniero Topete Bordes of the Junta de
                            Administracíon, and Messrs. Bay and Holland of the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>At the meeting on July 7, 1943 the subject of undertakings was brought up
                            voluntarily by the Mexican officials. Ingeniero Topete Bordes stated
                            that the Junta de Administración strictly prohibits vested companies
                            subject to its management and which have been deleted from the
                            Proclaimed List, from having any business dealings of any character with
                            any firm or individual whose name still appears on the Proclaimed List,
                            even though the firm be one which has been vested by the Mexican
                            Government. When asked whether this prohibition would extend to List 2
                            individuals upon their deletion, he replied that the Junta de
                            Administracíon is concerned only with vested <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515"
                                facs="0529"/>firms and its policies would therefore not apply to
                            such individuals. Sr. Cordoba then stated that the Foreign Office had no
                            legal right to require a Mexican citizen to furnish an undertaking not
                            to deal with Proclaimed List firms since under the laws of Mexico, such
                            dealings are not prohibited. He stated that if the Foreign Office
                            undertook to summon List 2 individuals and require such an undertaking
                            of them, it could place itself in an embarrassing situation since the
                            Attorney General could properly issue instructions that it cease such
                            practices. Sr. Cordoba stated however, that in cases where individuals
                            voluntarily presented themselves to the Foreign Office seeking its
                            assistance in obtaining their deletion from the Proclaimed List, he
                            could and would gladly obtain from them such an undertaking. He pointed
                            out at the same time that to obtain undertakings in this manner from all
                            List 2 individuals would be impractical since some might not ever
                            present themselves voluntarily at the Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing information is submitted to the Department as being
                            relevant to the subject of the Embassy’s Airgram No. 1541 cited above.
                            The Embassy will await the Department’s further instructions.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I take pleasure in
                            acknowledging receipt of your kind letter of the 24th of last month, in
                            which you mention the possibility that the Alien Property Custodian, Mr.
                            Leo Crowley, put at the disposal of the Mexican Government members of
                            the enterprises which he manages, in order to contribute to the success
                            of our chemical and pharmaceutical industries.</p>
                        <p>I am very grateful to you for the spontaneous and friendly interest with
                            which you have been good enough to consider this matter within the
                            framework of close cooperation which characterizes the development of
                            relations between our peoples and, although for the present I am not in
                            a position to make a concrete decision in this matter, I believe that it
                            would be very suitable for Mr. Crowley himself—or his authorized
                            representative—to come, informally, to Mexico with the object of
                            explaining his projects more fully since everything which could result
                            in a collaboration of mutual benefit for our Republics will always be
                            warmly welcomed by us.</p>
                        <p>If you consider that the trip I allude to can be accomplished, I shall
                            appreciate your letting me know either directly or through Ambassador
                            Messersmith. who is fully acquainted with the matter as he has <pb
                                n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0530"/>likewise begun discussions
                            regarding it with the Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Mexico.</p>
                        <p>In the last paragraphs of your letter you kindly refer to our interviews
                            at Monterrey and Corpus Christi. I also retain the best of recollections
                            of the important conversations we had on that occasion, which gave me
                            the opportunity of appreciating directly and personally the noble
                            democratic fervor of your decision in favor of a policy of equity and
                            social justice for our America.</p>
                        <p>With the hope of seeing you soon in the manner in which we planned it
                            during our meeting in the month of April, I greet you with all
                            consideration and renew the assurances of my cordial friendship.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s Circular Instruction dated June 18, 1943,<note n="60"
                                xml:id="d430fn60">Not printed.</note> transmitting to this Embassy a
                            copy of a memorandum entitled: “United States Financial Assistance to
                            Eliminate Undesirable Ownership and Control from Proclaimed List Firms”.
                            The Embassy is instructed to transmit to the Department any comments,
                            suggestions, or questions which it might have, particularly with
                            reference to the problems of Mexico.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy is of the opinion that funds are not needed for the purpose
                            of furnishing firms which have been seized by the Mexican Government
                            with working capital. Mexican officials have, in conferences with
                            officers of the Embassy, indicated that most of the seized firms are in
                            excellent financial condition and, in fact, have an excess of available
                            capital which has accumulated as a result of their inability to purchase
                            American merchandise.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy is further of the opinion that it would be inadvisable to
                            offer financial assistance as an encouragement to the sale of seized
                            firms by the Mexican Government. This conclusion is based on several
                            considerations.</p>
                        <p>All Proclaimed List firms the seizure of which was recommended by the
                            Embassy have been vested and, so long as they are operated by the
                            Mexican Government, there need be no fear of undesirable activities. It
                            is feared, however, that, should they be sold, a strong possibility
                            would exist that the purchasers would be dummies who, at the expiration
                            of the war, would return the enterprises to their former owners.</p>
                        <p>The Mexican Government has indicated a desire to retain and <pb n="517"
                                xml:id="pg_517" facs="0531"/>operate these companies at least for
                            the present. As previous correspondence on this subject reveals, it has
                            established an elaborate and efficient organization for the
                            administration and development of the seized firms, an organization
                            which appears to be determined to see that the companies prosper.</p>
                        <p>That the policy of the Mexican Government does not envisage the sale of
                            the vested enterprises is also evidenced by statements of various
                            interested persons that the minimum bid required when El Nuevo Japón,
                            Trapeha S.A., and certain other vested companies were offered for sale
                            in the latter part of 1942 was so high as to make bidding impossible.
                            This, coupled with the fact that the offer of sale has not been renewed
                            since their deletion, despite the fact that the representative of the
                            Junta de Administracíon stated to the Embassy that the reason the firms
                            were not sold was that no one wanted to bid on a Proclaimed List firm,
                            indicates that these offers may have been made without any real
                            intention to sell the firms and solely because of the favorable
                            impression that the offers would make on this Embassy.</p>
                        <p>Further evidence of the Mexican Government’s present unwillingness to
                            offer vested firms for sale arises from the fact that although there is
                            at present a large amount of interested capital available in Mexico for
                            investment in such firms as these, it has been reported that the Mexican
                            Government has discouraged overtures from local investors seeking to
                            negotiate for the purchase of vested firms.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, it is not believed that an offer of financial
                            assistance such as that described in the circular instruction under
                            reference would improve the situation in Mexico. The prosperity and
                            growth of vested firms under government ownership and direction
                            constitutes in itself the best assurance that they will never be
                            relinquished to their former owners. The more important aims of a
                            program of financial assistance, namely, the adoption and enforcement of
                            a comprehensive program to eliminate undesirable elements of ownership
                            and control from seized firms, have already been obtained in Mexico. As
                            has been stated, Mexico’s program for controlling enemy property is
                            effective not only in its terms but also in the vigorous manner of its
                            application. The Mexican Government has not only seized all firms whose
                            vestiture was requested by this Embassy, but has also taken over
                            numerous other Axis enterprises. It has not only discharged those
                            employees whom its own investigations revealed to be undesirable, but
                            has also removed others who were discharged for no other reason than
                            because the Embassy requested it. Some individuals have been discharged
                            at the request of the Embassy even though the company by which they were
                            employed had already been deleted from the Proclaimed List. The
                            cooperation between the officials of the Mexican Government charged with
                            the administration of vested <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0532"
                            />companies and officers of the Embassy has been frank and sincere. The
                            Embassy has encountered no resentment against its suggestions regarding
                            the administration of seized firms. On the contrary, the responsible
                            Mexican officials have on several occasions pointed out that, because of
                            its numerous sources of information, the Embassy can frequently be of
                            material assistance to them.</p>
                        <p>For the foregoing reasons, namely: <list>

                                <item>That there is at present ample capital in Mexico available for

                                <label><hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</label>
                                <item>That a possibility exists that if they are offered for sale
                                    the former owners would attempt to repurchase them through

                        <p rend="flushleft">the Embassy believes that the type of financing
                            described in the Department’s instruction under reference is not needed

                            <p>President Roosevelt, in his letter of June 24, 1943, to President
                                Avila Camacho, expressed his desire to extend all possible
                                assistance to the Mexican Government in its program of utilizing
                                certain former German companies for the further development within
                                Mexico of the chemical, pharmaceutical, dye and allied industries.
                                President Roosevelt’s letter also expressed his willingness to have
                                placed at the disposition of the Mexican Government the facilities
                                of certain companies under the control of Mr. Leo T. Crowley, Alien
                                Property Custodian of the United States, with a view of aiding the
                                Mexican Government in its program and to facilitating the training
                                of Mexican technicians and, also, to increasing the supplies of
                                products necessary to the Mexican economy.</p>
                            <p>In acknowledging President Roosevelt’s letter, President Avila
                                Camacho stated<note n="62" xml:id="d431fn63">Letter of July 9, <ref
                                        target="#pg_515">p. 515</ref>.</note> that he welcomed any
                                contribution which would result in a collaboration of mutual benefit
                                and that Mr. Crowley, or, one of his associates, would be received
                                informally in Mexico to discuss more fully any suggestions which Mr.
                                Crowley might make. In accordance with this exchange of
                                communications, Mr. Crowley has designated Mr. Morrison G. Tucker to
                                come to Mexico as his representative.</p>

                                Roosevelt’s communication, the Ambassador of the United States
                                outlined a possible approach to the problem of the Mexican
                                Government as suggested by the Alien Property Custodian. Since the
                                transmission of this suggestion, the Alien Property Custodian and
                                other <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0534"/>Agencies of our
                                Government have given further and careful consideration to all
                                possible measures of assistance and cooperation which would be in
                                line with the traditional policies of the Mexican Government and
                                which would accomplish the ends which the Mexican Government has in
                                mind with respect to its domestic chemical and pharmaceutical
                                industries.</p>
                            <p>Bearing in mind the best interests of the two Governments, the Alien
                                Property Custodian and other Agencies of the United States
                                Government believe that maximum benefits may be obtained for Mexico
                                under a plan such as herein suggested, which would draw upon the
                                technical and supply resources not only of the chemical concerns
                                controlled by the Custodian, but also of other private United States
                                enterprises. Accordingly, the following plan is submitted for the
                                consideration of the Mexican Government as a basis for further
                                discussion. As will be readily discerned, the plan is not
                                complicated, but is essentially simple. It leaves the decision to
                                the Mexican Government or an Agency thereof as to what services it
                                may desire from companies under the jurisdiction of the Custodian or
                                from other private companies whose facilities may be beneficial to
                                the success of the Mexican program.</p>
                            <p>The plan proposed is as follows: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>—It is suggested that the Mexican Government organize a
                                        Company for the purpose of holding the former German equity
                                        and credit interests in certain vested concerns engaged in
                                        the pharmaceutical and chemical field. The holding of the
                                        stock and other interests in these vested companies would
                                        give the Mexican Holding Company full control while leaving
                                        each individual vested concern separate as to its assets and
                                        operating management, if so desired. By maintaining each
                                        vested concern as a separate entity, instead of combining
                                        the assets of all vested concerns into a whole, individual
                                        United States companies could make separate contracts with
                                        individual vested enterprises. It will be noted in Item 3
                                        that the plan herein suggested provides for separate
                                        contracts or agreements between related Mexican and United
                                        States companies or groups of companies. It is suggested
                                        that the directorate of the Mexican Holding Company be small
                                        and be made responsible to the President of the Republic or
                                        to the Junta Intersecretarial.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>—It is further suggested that a Joint Commission be
                                        appointed to be composed of five members. Three members of
                                        this Commission should be chosen from the directorate of the
                                        Mexican Holding Company, the president of the Mexican
                                        Holding Company serving as chairman of the Joint Commission.
                                        The two United States members of the Commission should be
                                        named by the Alien Property Custodian. This Joint Commission
                                        would act in a liaison and advisory capacity to the Mexican
                                        Holding Company and to the Alien Property Custodian. It
                                        would advise as to which companies, both Mexican and United
                                        States, should be included in any agreements or contracts
                                        and, also, as to what provisions and terms the contracts and
                                        agreements should contain.</item>

                                    <label>3.</label>
                                    <item>—The Alien Property Custodian controls a number of
                                        chemical and pharmaceutical concerns which manufacture many
                                        of the products which have been distributed in Mexico by
                                        concerns now vested by the Mexican Government. Such concerns
                                        under the control of the Custodian would be in a position to
                                        make separate and favorable contracts or agreements with
                                        corresponding concerns vested by the Mexican Government.
                                        These separate contracts or agreements in some instances
                                        might only provide that the United States company will
                                        supply the Mexican company with products which it requires
                                        for domestic distribution and sale. In the case of another
                                        Mexican company, the contract might require not only the
                                        supplying of United States products, but, also, technical
                                        assistance. Still another intervened company might not only
                                        require a source of supply and technical aid, but, also
                                        managerial assistance. Furthermore, there is a group of
                                        vested companies whose primary function is to distribute
                                        products throughout the Republic of Mexico and this group
                                        might need the experience and assistance of experts from
                                        large United States distributing organizations. The main
                                        point is that the Mexican Holding Company would choose the
                                        type of assistance which each individual vested company or
                                        group of companies might require. The request for this
                                        assistance would be transmitted to the Alien Property
                                        Custodian through the Joint Commission, and the Alien
                                        Property Custodian would recommend the company or companies
                                        under his jurisdiction best fitted to give the assistance
                                        required by the Mexican Holding Company. Should the Alien
                                        Property Custodian find that no company under his
                                        jurisdiction was adequately equipped to perform the services
                                        requested by the Mexican Holding Company, then, he would
                                        solicit the cooperation of other independent United States
                                        companies whose experience, skill and organization would
                                        most efficiently meet the requirements. Thus, the Alien
                                        Property Custodian would plan to draw not only upon the
                                        resources and skill of companies under his jurisdiction,
                                        out, also, upon United States industry in general. It is
                                        envisioned that the contracts or agreements to be made with
                                        the vested Mexican companies would not have the Alien
                                        Property Custodian as a party thereto, but, the individual
                                        companies under his jurisdiction or other private companies
                                        desiring to participate.</item>

                                        Custodian, Mr. Leo T. Crowley, is also the Director of the

                                        Company could make known to the Alien Property Custodian its
                                        desire for the establishment or creation of new or

                                        in Mexico. The Alien Property Custodian would use his best
                                        efforts to assist the Mexican Holding Company in these
                                        respects.</item>

                                    <item>—With reference to the former German trademarks, it is
                                        suggested that they gradually be retired from active use by
                                        the vested companies and that new trademarks be instituted.
                                        During the period while the new trademarks are being
                                        established in the market, they would be used in conjunction
                                        with the old German trademarks, the latter being withdrawn
                                        as the new trademarks become known. Other aspects of the
                                        trademark question could be considered by the Joint
                                        Commission.</item>

                            <p>The plan suggested above has four primary purposes. First, it affords
                                the Mexican pharmaceutical, chemical, dye and allied industries all
                                possible assistance from United States industry. Second, the plan
                                leaves to the Mexican Government the determination of the type and
                                degree of assistance which each of the vested companies may require.
                                Third, the plan provides that all commercial and business relations
                                shall be between private United States concerns and the Mexican
                                Holding Company or Mexican vested enterprises. And fourth, unless
                                the Mexican Government requests otherwise, the administration and
                                management of the vested companies will remain entirely in Mexican
                                hands. The purpose of the plan is to endeavor to make available to
                                the Mexican Government sources of supply, technical experience and
                                other forms of assistance which the Mexican Government may desire in
                                relation to the development and coordination of vested companies in
                                the field of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, dyes, and allied
                                products.</p>

                        <p>If despatch referred to does not do so, please inform Department fully
                            how the governmental commitments of the letters of President Roosevelt
                            and Mr. Crowley are to be carried out under Tucker’s new suggestions.
                            The Development Corporation was, of course, suggested by Tucker’s
                            memorandum as the best method of discharging these responsibilities. The
                            Department has recognized from the outset the political difficulties of
                            this suggestion, but believed that the nature of the commitments made
                            the assumption of responsibility by this Government unavoidable.</p>
                        <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0537"/>
                        <p>While Tucker will of course be permitted considerable scope for
                            negotiations within outlines of a general plan approved by the
                            Department, it is suggested that basic changes in the Custodian’s
                            proposal should be referred to the Department before being presented to
                            the Mexicans. The personal interest in this matter of the President and
                            the importance of the over-all policies involved make it undesirable to
                            rely on later clearance for basic issues.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s comments on Tucker’s memorandum should not be construed
                            as a disregard of the bilateral character of the negotiations. Rather,
                            the Department has emphasized that the proposal must recognize Mexican
                            needs and expectations, especially in view of this Government’s prior
                            broad commitments. [Acheson.]</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Tuck</hi>: I was glad to receive your letter of
                            August 12th and the copies of your letters of August 14th<note n="67"
                                xml:id="d433fn67">None printed.</note> to Jim Markham.<note n="68"
                                xml:id="d433fn68">Deputy Alien Property Custodian.</note></p>
                        <p>The negotiations seem to have gotten off to an excellent start, and we
                            all feel that you and the Ambassador have very skillfully handled a very
                            difficult situation.</p>
                        <p>As you know, we were not particularly wedded to the idea of a development
                            corporation. It may be useful as a kind of historical note, however, to
                            make a distinction between two questions. The first question is whether
                            or not a development corporation would be a desirable mechanism for
                            organizing the resources of the Alien Property Custodian and the other
                            American companies in connection with the Mexican program. The second
                            question is the degree of intervention which such a development
                            corporation or any other instrument, such as GAF,<note n="69"
                                xml:id="d433fn69">General Aniline and Film Company (United
                                States).</note> for example, would exercise in the internal
                            management of Mexican businesses. We always recognized that the degree
                            of such intervention would be a matter to be worked out with the
                            Mexicans. However, it seemed to us that even if it were decided to have
                            management which was exclusively Mexican, the development corporation
                            might be an effective instrumentality for organizing United States
                            participation. For example, it might have functioned as the instrument
                            by which American technicians or supplies might be made available to the
                            Mexican management corporation even though it (i. e. the <pb n="524"
                                xml:id="pg_524" facs="0538"/>development corporation) did not
                            participate at all in internal operations in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>I have felt that we did not draw this distinction with sufficient
                            clarity. We would, of course, have been clearer but for the fact that
                            the Cyanamid negotiation and various reports from Garfías and from
                            Mexico indicated that the Mexicans were prepared to accept a
                            considerable degree of American participation in management.</p>
                        <p>It has been very pleasant to read Ambassador Messersmith’s commendatory
                            reports about your work in Mexico. I hope your mission will be as
                            pleasant as it has been effective.</p>

                            despatch No. 12649 of August 31, 1943,<note n="70" xml:id="d434fn70">Not
                                printed.</note> concerning the plans of the Mexican Government to
                            establish a chemical industry in Mexico and with particular reference to
                            the Embassy’s despatch No. 12148 of August 14, 1943, to transmit
                            herewith a copy of the Spanish text of Note No. 359 dated August 27,
                            1943, together with an English translation thereof,<note n="71"
                                xml:id="d434fn71">Enclosures not printed.</note> in which the
                            Mexican Government outlines the terms under which it is willing to
                            accept the cooperation of the American Government for a chemical
                            industry in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>In brief, the Mexican Government proposes to organize a corporation to
                            take over the properties, interests and rights of certain German-owned
                            companies now in the possession of the Mexican Government and which are
                            engaged in chemical, pharmaceutical, dye and related activities. When
                            organized, the holding company is to have absolute ownership over all
                            the seized properties while maintaining within the corporation the
                            integrity of each of the companies concerned. The Mexican Government is
                            agreeable to the proposal that assistance required, either material,
                            technical or administrative, be provided by means of separate contracts
                            or agreements between firms controlled by the Alien Property Custodian
                            and the corresponding firms controlled by the Mexican Government, or, in
                            the event that no firm under the jurisdiction of the Alien Property
                            Custodian possesses the appropriate factors, the cooperation of private
                            American companies qualified by experience, ability and organization
                            will be sought. The Mexican holding entity and the Alien Property
                            Custodian shall each designate <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0539"
                            />a commissioner to act in consultative capacity and in liaison between
                            the Mexican organization and the Alien Property Custodian. Their chief
                            function shall be to determine the character of the assistance needed
                            and which American company or companies are best able to furnish it. The
                            Commissioners shall also deal with the question of the creation of new
                            or additional facilities necessary to the development and expansion of
                            the Mexican chemical industry.</p>
                        <p>The communication from the Mexican Government takes note that the Alien
                            Property Custodian, as director of the office of Economic Warfare, is in
                            an advantageous position to facilitate the necessary arrangements for
                            authorizing the exportation of supplies, subject to the exigencies of
                            the united war efforts of the two republics, and states that a study
                            will be made of the desirability of the gradual withdrawal from active
                            use of former German trade marks hitherto in use by the seized
                            firms.</p>
                        <p>The note accepts the proposal as set forth in the memorandum presented to
                            the Foreign Office, a report of which was forwarded in despatch No.
                            12148 of August 14, 1943, with the exception of two slight
                            modifications. These modifications consist in making the Board of
                            Directors of the Mexican holding company responsible to the President-of
                            Mexico, and in the designation of two commissioners, one to represent
                            the Mexican holding company and one to be designated by the Alien
                            Property Custodian instead of five commissioners as originally proposed.
                            The modifications were suggested by Sr, Cabrera in a conversation which
                            took place on August 14 and reported to the Department in despatch No.
                            12153 of August 16, 1943.<note n="72" xml:id="d434fn72">Not

                            />to negotiations with the Mexican Government concerning the
                            reorganization of the vested drug and chemical firms in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>The Department has studied very carefully the exchange of memoranda
                            between the Embassy and the Mexican Government. The Department is
                            disturbed by the implication in paragraph 3 of the plan as proposed in
                            the Embassy’s memorandum of August 10<note n="74" xml:id="d435fn74"><hi
                                    rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_519">p.
                                519</ref>.</note> and reflected in paragraph 2 of the memorandum
                            from the Mexican Government,<note n="75" xml:id="d435fn75">Dated August
                                27, not printed.</note> that the contracts will be made with
                            companies under the control of the Alien Property Custodian wherever
                            these companies are adequately equipped to perform the services required
                            by the Mexican holding company. The change in the basis of negotiations
                            which excluded any participation by the United States Government or any
                            instrumentality thereof, except in an advisory capacity, in the
                            reorganization of the Mexican vested firms, should reduce trie
                            Custodian’s companies to the level of private companies in competition
                            with the other private companies. Both the Alien Property Custodian and
                            the Department are unwilling to permit any arrangement which has the
                            appearance of giving the Alien Property Custodian companies a
                            competitive advantage in contracts which are to be negotiated on a
                            purely commercial basis.</p>
                        <p>Although it is clear that Mr. Crowley intends to direct his companies to
                            make contracts which will be advantageous to the Mexicans, nevertheless,
                            the Department and the Alien Property Custodian may be subjected to
                            severe criticism for having used the Custodian’s governmental position
                            to advance the interests of companies which are in competition with
                            other American firms. The Department believes that it is imperative that
                            both our note to the Mexicans and their reply be rephrased so as to
                            indicate that the commissioner appointed by the Alien Property Custodian
                            acting in the capacity of a representative of this Government, will use
                            his good offices to select that American company best able to render the
                            assistance required by the Mexican holding company on terms satisfactory
                            to the Mexicans.</p>
                        <p>The Department recognizes the difficulty involved in incorporating this
                            change into notes which have already been delivered. Nevertheless, in
                            view of the unfortunate implication that is contained in the present
                            phrasing of the notes, you are requested to place before the Mexicans
                            this Government’s desire that the notes be amended to conform with the
                            ideas expressed above. The Department is confident that the Mexicans
                            will themselves appreciate the difficulties that might flow from a
                            publication of the note in its present form. Representatives of the
                            Department have had an informal conference with Mr. Mahoney of the
                            Office of the Alien Property Custodian since his <pb n="527"
                                xml:id="pg_527" facs="0541"/>return from Mexico and understand that
                            this point has been reexamined by the Embassy and that remedial steps
                            along the lines suggested above are being taken.</p>
                        <p>With further reference to the note transmitted by the Mexicans, the
                            Department notes that the Mexican Government will study the desirability
                            of adopting the trade-mark policy urged in the Embassy’s memorandum. As
                            indicated in the Department’s circular instruction of July 17,<note
                                n="76" xml:id="d435fn76">Not printed.</note> the Department feels
                            that the continued use of the Axis trade-marks is dangerous because of
                            the possibility that it may facilitate the re-establishment of the
                            private arrangements for allocation of markets that existed before the
                            war. It is not intended by this to suggest that this Government is
                            opposed to the re-establishment of trade relations with enemy countries
                            after the war, but merely to emphasize the necessity for obstructing the
                            return of German cartel domination. It would, of course, be highly
                            desirable if the Mexicans could be persuaded to take a stronger line in
                            their note—to indicate, for example, agreement in principle, with study
                            to be devoted to the best means of carrying out the program. The
                            Department realizes, of course, that you and Mr. Tucker are thoroughly
                            conversant with the problem and have undoubtedly made every effort to
                            gain the adoption of a trade-mark policy consistent with the
                            Department’s view.</p>
                        <p>The Department and the Office of Economic Warfare are somewhat disturbed
                            lest the Mexicans may be attaching a special significance to the fact
                            that Mr. Crowley is Director of the Office of Economic Warfare. The
                            Office of Economic Warfare has requested that it be made clear to the
                            Mexicans that allocations of material to the vested properties must be
                            made in accordance with the relevant statutory and administrative
                            provisions and on an impartial basis in the light of war requirements
                            and the requirements of the United Nations and of all the American
                            republics. The Department concurs in the Office of Economic Warfare’s
                            request.</p>
                        <p>It is noted that the exchange of notes makes no reference to the problem
                            of the continued employment of Axis personnel. The Department is
                            confident that the Mexicans are in agreement that undesirable personnel
                            not discharged at the time the companies were deleted from the
                            Proclaimed List should be eliminated as rapidly as suitable replacements
                            can be found. If your discussions have not raised this point, however,
                            it would be desirable to clarify this Government’s position on this
                            matter in order to make sure that there is a common understanding of the
                            economic warfare objective to be gained.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the informal memorandum which Mr. Tucker handed to the
                            Mexicans at the conference on August 27,<note n="77" xml:id="d435fn77"
                                >Memorandum not printed.</note> the Department <pb n="528"
                                xml:id="pg_528" facs="0542"/>is concerned by the suggestion that a
                            merger might be arranged of the vested Bayer Company and the Sterling
                            organization in Mexico. It is far from clear to the Department whether
                            the proposal is to have Bayer acquire the Sterling interests or whether
                            the converse is contemplated. The latter merger would be covered by the
                            Sterling Representations, and, as a consequence, would require the
                            approval of the Department, Treasury and the Department of Justice
                            before it could be consummated. There are informal, but nonetheless
                            definite indications, that permission for such a transaction would not
                            be forthcoming. Moreover, it seems to the Department desirable, from a
                            standpoint of policy, that the Sterling organization and Bayer, in view
                            of the fact that they sell competing products, should not be merged but
                            that their independence should be maintained.</p>
                        <p>It is the Department’s thought that the Embassy’s note of reply might
                            refer to this Government’s gratification at the success of the
                            negotiations between the Alien Property Custodian’s mission and the
                            Government of Mexico, and continue by stating that, in accord with the
                            commitments made in President Roosevelt’s letter to President Avila
                            Camacho, this Government would be happy to implement any suggestions
                            that the Mexicans might wish to make with reference to intergovernmental
                            cooperation to supplement the arrangements already made.</p>
                        <p>The Department wishes to congratulate you, Mr. Tucker and the members of
                            your staffs on your splendid handling of very difficult and intricate
                            negotiations. The Department recognizes that there may arise many
                            difficult problems in the implementation of the agreement that has been
                            worked out. It is believed, however> that these difficulties can be
                            readily overcome, and that arrangements within the framework which has
                            been established will be beneficial to the economies both of this
                            country and of Mexico, and conducive to the enduring friendship between
                            our two republics.</p>

                            />paragraph 3 of the Embassy’s memorandum of August 10, 1943, containing
                            the proposal of the Alien Property Custodian to assist the Mexican
                            Government in its plans to establish a chemical industry in Mexico, I
                            have the honor to inform the Department that the Embassy submitted a
                            revised memorandum to the Mexican Government which bore the date of
                            August 10, 1943, and substituted for the original text of paragraph 3
                            the revised text of that paragraph as authorized by the Department’s
                            telegram under reference.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has now received from the Foreign Office an acceptance of the
                            Embassy’s revised memorandum of August 10, 1943. The communication from
                            the Foreign Office is dated August 27, 1943, and is in all respects
                            similar to the original memorandum of the Foreign Office bearing that
                            date. The only change is in paragraph 2, which has been modified to
                            conform with the changes made in paragraph 3 of our memorandum of August
                            10, 1943. In other words, a new exchange of memoranda has been effected
                            in which the text of paragraph 3 of our memorandum of August 10, 1943,
                            has been modified in accordance with the Department’s wishes, and the
                            memorandum from the Foreign Office has accepted the modification in a
                            revised memorandum. This last exchange of memoranda is, therefore, in
                            place of the original exchange of memoranda and is to constitute the
                            official record.</p>
                        <p>The only exception taken in the memorandum from the Foreign Office to the
                            revised text of paragraph 3 of our memorandum relates to that part of
                            our paragraph 3 which reads as follows: “The request for this assistance
                            would be transmitted to the Alien Property Custodian through the joint
                            commission …”. The memorandum from the Foreign Office states that
                            requests for assistance will be transmitted to the Alien Property
                            Custodian through the <hi rend="italic">Special Commissioner</hi>
                            instead of through the joint commission, which is mentioned in paragraph
                            3 of our memorandum. The Embassy perceives no objection to this change
                            suggested by the Foreign Office, and it will await approval of the
                            Department before making an acknowledgment and accepting the terms of
                            the communication.</p>

                            1943, with the revised paragraph 3 as submitted, and copies of the
                            memorandum received from the Foreign Office with revised paragraph

                            <p>3.–Acting as an intermediary, the Alien Property Custodian is in a
                                favorable position to use his good offices to the end of procuring
                                assistance for the Mexican Holding Company from either the companies
                                under his control or private American companies, whichever may be
                                best fitted to render the type of assistance required. After the
                                Mexican Holding Company has chosen the United States firms which it
                                deems best fitted to perform the services required, then contracts
                                between the companies under the jurisdiction of the Holding Company
                                and the individual United States companies could be entered into on
                                a voluntary commercial basis. These separate contracts or agreements
                                in some instances might only provide that the United States company
                                will supply the Mexican Company with products which it requires for
                                domestic distribution and sale. In the case of another Mexican
                                company, the contract might require not only the Supplying of United
                                States products, but also technical assistance. Still another
                                intervened company might not only require a source of supply and
                                technical aid, but, also, managerial assistance. Furthermore, there
                                is a group of vested companies whose primary function is to
                                distribute products throughout the Republic of Mexico, and this
                                group might need the experience arid assistance of experts from
                                large United States distributing organizations. The main point is
                                that the Mexican Holding Company would choose the type of assistance
                                which each individual vested company or group of companies might
                                require. The request for this assistance would be transmitted to the
                                Alien Property Custodian through the Joint Commission, and the Alien
                                Property Custodian would recommend, after careful consideration, the
                                company or companies best fitted to give the assistance required by
                                the Mexican Holding Company. In this manner, the Alien Property
                                Custodian would draw upon not only the resources and skill of
                                companies under his jurisdiction, but also upon the United States
                                industry in general. All contracts or agreements to be made with the
                                vested Mexican companies would be made directly with the American
                                firms without the participation of the Alien Property Custodian as a
                                party thereto.</p>

                        <p>1. From Agriculture. From best information available, for work in
                            essential crops in California and Arizona during year 1943, we would
                            need following movement of Mexican Agricultural workers: Entering United
                            States in January, 2800; February, 3200; March, 3200; April, 2600; May,
                            1400. Returning to Mexico: June, 2200; July, 1800. Entering United
                            States in August, 8200, September, 4800. Returning to Mexico: October,
                            3800; November, 6400; December, 6000. These figures may be subject to
                            certain adjustments, but present indications are that any such
                            adjustments would tend to increase them to some extent rather than
                            decrease.</p>
                        <p>If short staple cotton, pruning, general farming and livestock
                            enterprises are included, the peak on account of these operations would
                            reach 50,000 in November 1943. Should these be included we will submit
                            itemized month by month figure.</p>
                        <p>We should appreciate this being brought to attention of proper Mexican
                            authorities, asking their approval as quickly as possible, so necessary
                            arrangements can be made with other agencies of United States concerned.

                            the Mexican authorities but it is possible that we soon may be. It would
                            accordingly be helpful if the Department might expedite reply to the

                                The 2,000 certification expired on December 1, 1942, and no workers
                                were nor can be now supplied under this certification. Approximately
                                451 workers have been supplied for Yuma, and although the
                                certification contained no time clause, Immigration<note n="92"

                                under this certification. On January 15, however, Immigration called
                                to reverse this point, and state that 49 can be recruited now and
                                that the 500 total can be maintained in the United States until
                                further notice without further certification.</item>

                            <item>On October 28, 1942, there was a certification for 1,800 workers
                                for the Imperial Valley. Some 733 of these workers were contracted
                                in November, and it is the Department’s understanding that the
                                balance of approximately 1,000 workers has been selected and
                                contracted in recent days. This certification is on a different
                                basis. It permits maintaining the workers in the United States for
                                90 days from the date of entrance.</item>

                                the Embassy’s telegram no. 9, Major Walker states that the June and

                            <item>In regard to the guayule workers, Major Walker states that studies
                                are being made to determine the peak times of need in this field
                                with the idea of being able to meet peak demands by shifting of
                                off-season surpluses of workers from New Mexico and Arizona. Such a
                                shifting would help to take care of any surplus from the adjustment
                                mentioned in 6 above. Major Walker is not able to make a definite
                                statement on the guayule workers until the studies mentioned above

                                states, but he does not yet have an opinion as to whether the
                                California state compensation tax is applicable.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Major Walker has promised to keep the Department informed on developments
                            in regard to the points listed above, and this information will be
                            promptly forwarded to the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>He also suggests that the Embassy may wish to mention informally to Mr.
                                Hidalgo<note n="94" xml:id="d439fn94">Ernesto Hidalgo, Oficial Mayor
                                of the Mexican Ministry for Foreign Affairs.</note> of the Foreign
                            Office the desirability of increasing the amounts withheld for savings
                            to be returned to Mexico. He feels that many of the workers are spending
                            their earnings freely on nonessentials and that it would be to their
                            interests to have more savings at their disposition upon return to
                            Mexico. The Department perceives no objection to this suggestion.</p>
                        <p>Immigration on January 15 further clarified the question of replacements
                            by stating (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that replacements could be
                            contracted only for unexpired period of certification. Those in 2 above,
                            for example, can be given contracts expiring March 1; those in 4 above
                            for any remaining period of the 90 days from entry of the contingent
                            workers of which are being replaced. For example, if the Farm Security
                            Administration wishes to replace any losses from the contingent of 733
                            contracted in November, the contracts given replacement workers would be
                            for the unexpired portion of 90 days counted from the date of entry of
                            the original 733. Any replacements under the 1,000 just contracted under
                            the same certification, however, would be contractable for the unexpired
                            portion of 90 days counted from January 14 or 15, the day in which it is
                            presumed they would enter the United States. (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                            Future certification is expected to be on one definite time basis,
                            similar to that explained in 1 and 2 above, (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)
                            Replacements will need new global entry permits from Immigration (but
                            not new certification), (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Immigration will
                            telephone new information regarding certifications directly to the

                            workers in 1943. (Plan heretofore furnished in Department’s telegram No.
                            1 as amended by paragraph 6 of airgram 939 appears satisfactory basis

                            of substantial number of farm laborers is received here.</p>
                        <p>The Mexican authorities are confronted with an acute problem caused by
                            the movement to Mexico City of about 4,000 workers who cannot be
                            absorbed under existing authorizations. These workers, who are said by
                            Mr. Brown to be of a type well qualified for our needs, create a problem
                            in connection with their feeding, lodging, et cetera. Unless we can
                            recruit a substantial part of these people the Mexican Government must
                            expend money for their support or return to their homes.</p>
                        <p>While this problem is not directly of our making it is a political
                            problem for the Mexican Government.</p>
                        <p>With no desire to be an alarmist over the situation I venture to predict
                            that if we do not formulate our plans promptly we are in danger of
                            collapse of the agricultural recruitment program. Brown shares this view
                            particularly following statements made to him in the Mexican Department
                            of Labor daily for more than a week, which have indicated that it is not
                            interested in piecemeal recruiting of small groups a few hundred.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the Embassy’s
                            despatch 6783 of January 19, 1943,<note n="95" xml:id="d442fn95">Not
                                printed.</note> regarding the recruiting of agricultural
                            laborers.</p>
                        <p>This morning I had a talk with Señor Hidalgo, who informed me that the
                            Embassy’s note,<note n="95" xml:id="d442fn96">Not printed.</note> of
                            which a copy was furnished the Department under cover of despatch 6783,
                            gave in writing the data he needed for further conversations with the
                            Mexican Labor Department.</p>
                        <p>Señor Hidalgo said that the Labor Department was making a study with
                            regard to the extent to which and places where agricultural labor would
                            be available for the United States. He again referred to the probability
                            that after the present situation was cleared up recruiting would take
                            place in two or three other parts of the Republic.</p>
                        <p>He said he could not assure us that the number of men we wanted would be
                            available, but said that since [<hi rend="italic">once?</hi>] the data
                            were available he would endeavor to give us an indication month by month
                            of the number of workers who could be recruited in Mexico. In this
                            respect he mentioned that beginning around May there would be
                            considerable need of agricultural labor in Mexico itself.</p>
                        <p>He said that he would ask the Mexican Labor Department to act as promptly
                            as possible in compliance with the request contained in our note.</p>
                        <p>He said that the Mexican Government “declined courteously” our informal
                            offer to appoint a small group of “collaborators” to supervise the
                            Mexicans in the United States who had been recruited under the
                            cooperative program. He said that for both practical and fundamental
                            reasons the Mexican Government did not feel it could accept our
                            suggestion. I again reminded Señor Hidalgo that we had made this
                            suggestion because of our familiarity with budgetary difficulties in
                            connection with items that had not been foreseen, but that we of course
                            did not desire to insist. Señor Hidalgo again stated that the offer was
                            appreciated but that he and the Minister of Labor had decided that they
                            would have to find the funds somehow and probably for a greater number
                            than the small group I had mentioned, in view of the increased number of
                            Mexicans who would probably be in the United States before very
                            long.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out to Señor Hidalgo that we urgently needed a number of the
                            workers currently being requested but that we had sought to have the
                            requisition expedited and made as large as possible with a view to
                            helping in the solution of the problem in Mexico City. Señor <pb n="537"
                                xml:id="pg_537" facs="0551"/>Hidalgo said he understood this as a
                            cooperative action on our part and that the problem had become less
                            acute because of the exodus of an as yet undetermined number of those
                            who were clamoring for work.</p>
                        <p>Señor Hidalgo again offered his full cooperation to us.</p>

                        <p>1001. Reference is made to the Department’s telegrams nos. 1 and 94 of
                            January 1 and 18, 1943, respectively, and to the Department’s airgram
                            no. 939 of January 15, 1943 regarding the securing of agricultural
                            workers from Mexico in the present year.</p>
                        <p>Major John Walker of the Farm Security Administration has informed the
                            Department that the War Manpower Commission has turned over to the
                            Department of Agriculture the complete operating responsibility for
                            recruiting and placing of all farm labor, and that this action gives
                            that Department, and consequently the Farm Security Administration, the
                            entire control over certification both for determining the need for farm
                            workers and for designating the place from which workers will be
                            secured, subject to the policies of the War Manpower Commission. He
                            stated that the new arrangement made it possible for the Farm Security
                            Administration to carry out the 1943 program or estimate for the
                            securing of workers from Mexico as set forth in the telegrams and
                            airgram under reference. He added that this would also permit the
                            Administration to certify immediately the need for the balance of the
                            10,500 workers for “unspecified crops in California as set forth in
                            paragraph 5 of the Department’s airgram no. 939, the certification of
                            3,000 of which was the subject of telegram no. 94.</p>
                        <p>Major Walker further pointed out that the new arrangement would permit
                            prompt handling by the Administration of any future difficulties such as
                            those caused recently in Mexico City when 5,000 workers caused disorders
                            in seeking selection for 1,000 contracts then available, and said that
                            this assurance could be given to the Embassy. It was stated to him that
                            this statement would be given only to the Embassy and in confidence,
                            because if the information were given to the interested Mexican
                            officials it might be interpreted in the future as an obligation on the
                            part of this Government to supply contracts for all applicants. He
                            agreed with this point, and promised to keep the Department informed of
                            future developments including the progress made in the next few days in
                            organizing the Farm Security Administration <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538"

                                the Office of Defense Transportation.</note> on that date in which
                            he stressed the great urgency of our railways in the Southwest to secure
                            some four or five hundred track workers from Mexico. He stated that from
                            the standpoint of the general war effort it is vitally important that
                            these men be obtained. You asked me to telegraph whether the Mexican
                            Government is willing to render this cooperation and will recruit such
                            labor, especially as our Government is rendering and has rendered so
                            much material assistance to the Railways of Mexico.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>I have gone into this detail to try to make it clear that we have had,
                            first of all, to maintain and to salvage the agreement for agricultural
                            labor which we actually have and which is so good and which must remain
                            in effect. In view of the opposition which there was to this agreement
                            from many quarters, and powerful ones, you will quite appreciate that I
                            could not press too strongly for this new agreement for labor other than
                            agricultural. To do so would merely have accentuated the opposition
                            which we had to the agreement for agricultural labor and in my opinion
                            would have made it impossible for us to carry through. In other words,
                            if I had pressed on this new agreement for unskilled workers other than
                            agricultural too strongly, the result would have been that we would have
                            got lip service so far as the agreement for agricultural workers is
                            concerned but no progress in recruiting. Because of the manner in which
                            we have handled it I think we can safely say that the agricultural
                            agreement is now again safe and that we can look forward to steady and
                            continuous recruitment of agricultural laborers to at least 50,000 this
                            year. I need not tell you that it was absolutely essential to follow
                            this prudent course, <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0555"/>because if
                            the agreement for agricultural labor had fallen down we would have had
                            tremendous criticism from wide sectors in Congress at home, both of this
                            Embassy and of the Department, and of the Mexican Government, etc.</p>
                        <p>Of course we have constantly kept alive the negotiation of a new
                            agreement for unskilled workers other than agricultural and we have
                            constantly kept this in the discussion, and the Mexicans have constantly
                            told us that they are in agreement to negotiate, but stressed that they
                            wished to get the agricultural agreement in shape and recruitment
                            started before they went at this other too actively. We now hope to make
                            some progress on the other agreement, but we are still not yet ready to
                            have someone come down from the Manpower Commission to talk about this,
                            for it is not adequately advanced here.…</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>I have consistently tried to make it clear at home that while we think we
                            will get such an agreement for unskilled workers other than agricultural
                            in due course, it will not give us in any degree the number of workers
                            which the agricultural program is giving us. I have also tried to make
                            it clear that the urgent situation which confronts our railways in the
                            West cannot be met in the immediate future by such unskilled track
                            workers from Mexico. The railways will have to find the immediate
                            solution for their immediate problem in some other way. I made this
                            adequately clear before I left Washington in February, so if the
                            railways have continued to depend upon the Mexican supply of labor for
                            the solution of their problem it cannot be any responsibility of this
                            Embassy.</p>
                        <p>You may be sure that we are giving this matter our very careful attention
                            and we are at it every day. It is just one of those things that we
                            cannot work out in a day.</p>
                        <p>With all good wishes,</p>
                        <p>Cordially and faithfully yours,</p>

                            Railways today informed Brown of Farm Security Administration that with
                            railway equipment presently assigned to movement of agricultural
                            laborers to the United States it will be possible under speedup now
                            provided for to move 7000 workers monthly to the United States. This
                            would involve sending five train loads of 750 workers each to Ciudad
                            Juarez each month and 650 workers to Guadalajara five times each
                            month.</p>
                        <p>Bursley has discussed this with Stevens of railway mission who states
                            that at least this rate should be attained and that after April 10 he
                            believes further increase would be practicable especially in view of
                            probable availability of additional equipment after that date. Stevens
                            again very strongly emphasized the inadvisability of sending American
                            railway equipment to Mexico for the movement of laborers.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to furnish the Department
                            with some observations which are the result of compiling the figures
                            available to the Embassy concerning the recruiting of agricultural
                            workers for work in the United States in order to show the rather urgent
                            need for further figures on estimated needs of agricultural workers for
                            1943, followed closely by a certification of these needs.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s telegram No. 1 of January 1, 1 p.m., estimated needs
                            during 1943 at 26,200. Up to the present date the Embassy has received
                            certifications of needs covering 23,200. There have been transported to
                            the United States up to and including today 11,491 workers. This leaves
                            a balance of 14,709 more workers to be recruited and transported in
                            order to meet the total estimate of 26,200 for 1943. At the present time
                            recruiting and shipping of workers are being carried forward at the rate
                            of 1,400 per week. This means that within ten weeks or by the end of
                            June there will have been recruited and transported to the United States
                            all those workers covered by the estimated needs.</p>
                        <p>The Mexican Government has stated that it will be willing to consider the
                            recruiting of agricultural workers to the over-all amount of 50,000
                            during 1943. It has made it clear, however, that it cannot consider any
                            larger number because of the effect this might have on Mexican domestic
                            economy and because of possible political repercussions. This should be
                            borne in mind in any revision which is made of estimated needs of
                            workers from Mexico during this year. On the one hand we may not expect
                            more than 50,000 workers from Mexico and on the other hand we should
                            consider that it would be unfortunate to require a lesser number of
                            workers because this would show that there is not the urgent need in the
                            United States for these workers which is a matter we have continually
                            kept before the Mexican authorities.</p>
                        <p>Since the Department’s telegram of January 1, referred to above, stated
                            that it would not be necessary to send workers to the United <pb n="544"
                                xml:id="pg_544" facs="0558"/>States during June or July unless
                            further certifications are received, the recruiting of agricultural
                            labor will automatically be suspended during July. It is the view of the
                            Embassy that it would be very unfortunate if recruiting had to stop for
                            any reason whatsoever because of the many difficulties, mostly
                            administrative, which are involved in getting it started again.
                            Furthermore, we have continued to impress the Mexican Government with
                            the urgent need for labor in the United States and therefore the Mexican
                            Government can hardly be expected to understand why recruiting should
                            stop because of a lack of certifications of need.</p>
                        <p>In the almost daily conversations the Embassy has had with officials of
                            the Mexican Government on the general subject of recruiting of laborers
                            the Mexicans have pointed out the absolute necessity for them to have as
                            accurate an approximation as possible of the estimated needs of both
                            agricultural and non-agricultural labor expected from Mexico during this
                            year for the Mexicans themselves are responsible for undertaking to have
                            a supply of such laborers available for recruiting and they must of
                            necessity gear the supply to the demand.</p>
                        <p>It would be appreciated if each certification of need sent to the Embassy
                            for transmission to the Mexican Government could be accompanied by a
                            statement that the number of workers in each case is included within the
                            over-all estimate of needs for 1943. The Foreign Office asks this
                            question each time a certification is notified to it.</p>
                        <p>I therefore urge the Department to convey the contents of this despatch
                            to the appropriate Departments and Agencies of the Government in order
                            that the Embassy may be enabled to supply the Mexican Government with
                            the information requested.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that there has been brought to my attention in connection with the
                            transportation of Mexican workers for work in the United States a
                            proposal whereby such workers would be transported in box cars.</p>
                        <p>At the present time such labor is being accommodated in first and second
                            class day coaches. However, the coaches which have been made available
                            for this purpose are shuttled constantly between Mexico City and the
                            border with no time out for repairs. If in <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545"
                                facs="0559"/>the future it is desirable to transport more workers
                            regularly, it will be extremely difficult, I am reliably informed, to
                            find any further first or second class coaches.</p>
                        <p>I realize that the above conflicts with the opinion in the Embassy’s
                            telegram No. 288 of March 23, 9 p.m. However, Stevens original estimate
                            that all necessary rail equipment could be made available to move these
                            workers, should be revised because a closer examination of the situation
                            does not warrant such optimism. The Embassy is watching this matter
                            closely and, bearing in mind the circumstances explained in its despatch
                            no. 9308 of April 15, 1943, is prepared to press the Mexican authorities
                            for more equipment or permission to enter American equipment whenever
                            that seems to be advisable. In this connection the help of Mr. Stevens
                            will be invaluable.</p>
                        <p>In conversations where the matter of box cars has come up, I have made it
                            clearly understood that I do not want the suggestion for the use of this
                            type of transportation to come from any source within our Government.
                            Frankly I see no objection to the use of box cars if the Mexican
                            Government should propose it as an expedient and as a means of moving
                            the labor at a future time. The matter is merely mentioned to the
                            Department for its information in order that it may know of the stand
                            taken by the Embassy in this regard.</p>

                                n="10" xml:id="d455fn10">Not printed; it conveyed the rejection by
                                the Department of Agriculture of any change in the existing practice
                                of providing food and lodging to the migratory workers
                                (811.504/2162a).</note> It is hoped that Agriculture understands the
                            consequences of refusal to accept the Mexican proposal regarding lodging
                            and subsistence. It came as a complete surprise to the Mexicans to learn
                            during the present negotiations that Mexican workers are not receiving
                            lodging and subsistence during the 25% period but are receiving these
                            minimum comforts only when needy and on a welfare basis. Therefore the
                            present Mexican proposal merely confirms what the Mexicans state was
                            originally intended as the meaning of this guaranty under the original
                            wording of the agreement. The Mexican argument designed to rebut our
                            contention that such treatment of Mexican workers amounts to
                            discrimination against domestic workers is as follows: (1). The American
                            worker usually has his family who can take care of him during a period
                            when he is not earning wages, the Mexican has no such recourse. (2). The
                            American worker may change his employment freely when he finds he can
                            earn more wages somewhere else. The Mexican may not change his
                            employment during the period of his contract without violating the
                            contract. The Mexicans also refer to the possibility that the Farm
                            Security Administration may not continue to administer this program
                            after June 30; with subsistence only available to Mexican workers where
                            needed and on a grant basis, the Mexicans insist on adequate guaranties
                            that whatever agency administers this program after June 30 will be
                            obliged to furnish lodging and subsistence as a part of the guarantee to
                            the Mexican worker.</p>
                        <p>I believe therefore if we return with a flat rejection simply on the
                            basis of our present policy we may be fairly certain the present
                            negotiations will collapse. We have reached complete agreement on all
                            other phases of our negotiations on the agricultural and
                            non-agricultural agreements. As I have repeatedly pointed out to the
                            Department these are very delicate matters and I believe our refusal to
                                <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0561"/>accede to this most
                            reasonable proposal of the Mexicans will result in a stoppage of
                            recruiting and an imputing [<hi rend="italic">impugning</hi>] of our
                            good faith in the entire undertaking. I should emphasize that it is
                            probable that difficulty over this aspect of agricultural agreement may
                            prejudice non-agricultural agreement. We had expected to sign both this
                            week.</p>

                            object to using present staff to recruit non-agricultural labor but the
                            situation described in airgram under reference should be borne in mind.
                            Total train capacity as Board worked out for May is at present 7000.
                            Total recruiting possibilities on basis of 24–day month and 500 per day
                            is 12,000. Taking care of Agriculture’s requirements of 7000 workers
                            during May a balance of 5000 non-Agricultural workers can be recruited
                            with present recruiting force during May.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy is satisfied that the Mexican Railways have arranged to place
                            maximum equipment at disposition FSA during May. Therefore if War

                            notes covering changes in the agricultural labor agreement of August 4,
                            1942 agreed upon by both Governments was made today effective April 26,
                            1943. Publicity will be given to this exchange by means of a communiqué
                            to the Mexican press drafted by the Foreign Office and which will be
                            handed to the press here at 8 p.m., April 30 for release in press May 1,
                            1943.</p>
                        <p>Since the changes made in the basic agreement will apply not only to
                            labor to be recruited but to all Mexican workers who have been recruited
                            since the inception program, it is respectfully suggested that the
                            Department may desire to arrange to have some publicity given to this
                            exchange of notes thereby reaching some persons now employing Mexican
                            agricultural labor who will be affected by the changes. An item of
                            interest which might find its way into such a notice to the press might
                            be based upon the fact that up to today’s date approximately 15,000
                            Mexican workers have reached the United States and are engaged in
                            agricultural work. 7,000 more are expected to move north during May and
                            a total of 50,000 may be sent during 1943.</p>
                        <p>It would be appreciated if whatever notification is given to the press in

                            exchanged notes with Licenciado Ezequiel Padilla, Mexican Minister of

                            effective April 29, 1943 and accordingly recruiting of this type of
                            labor may begin as soon as certification is received and the machinery
                            therefor is set up here. I enclose a copy of my note<note n="19"

                            Foreign Minister’s note will be sent by a later despatch.</p>
                        <p>I feel that the Embassy was particularly fortunate in having had the
                            assistance of Mr. Arthur W. Motley of the War Manpower Commission who
                            was here for ten days early this month in order to take part in the
                            negotiations which led to the successful conclusion of the agreement.
                            Aside from Mr. Motley and a representative of the Embassy the following
                            assisted at the discussions: Sr. Manuel Tello, Oficial Mayor of the
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Licenciado Padilla Nervo, Oficial Mayor of
                            the Ministry of Labor; Licenciado Luis [<hi rend="italic">Ruis</hi>]
                            Cortinas, Oficial Mayor of the Ministry of Gobernación and Mr. Harry F.
                            Brown, local representative of the Farm Security Administration whose
                            experience in the recruiting of agricultural labor under the Agreement
                            of August 4, 1942 was found most helpful.</p>
                        <p>The Mexican Government has given its assent to the recruiting of up to
                            6,000 non-agricultural laborers under this present agreement. It is
                            possible that we may expect more when that number has been contracted.
                            At the present time and until further notice such labor will be
                            recruited in Mexico City. The Mexican officials are extremely reluctant
                            to have recruiting take place elsewhere in the Republic largely because
                            the recruiting process unless carefully scrutinized and controlled can
                            easily be exploited by unauthorized persons seeking personal gain at the
                            expense of the Mexican worker. Furthermore, the Mexican Government lacks
                            competent officials who can supervise recruiting outside of Mexico
                            City.</p>
                        <p>As I have stressed to the Department it will be necessary for the War
                            Manpower Commission and the Department of Agriculture in Washington to
                            agree on the important question as to what proportion of transportation
                            space is to be allotted to agricultural workers and to non-agricultural
                            workers, since both types of workers will be recruited in Mexico City
                            and will proceed from here to the border. As soon as this aspect has
                            been determined upon it will be a simple matter to arrange a recruiting
                            schedule to synchronize with the transportation schedule.</p>
                        <p>It is, therefore, suggested that the Department may desire to make a copy
                            of this despatch and its enclosure available to the War Man-power <pb

                            reasons that (1) it would have no significance and (2) there would be no
                            point in the Mexican Government continuing the present expenditure of
                            money and effort involved in the examination and recruiting of
                            workers.</p>
                        <p>Tello did not indicate that his statements were in confidence but I do
                            not think they should be used except in United States Government
                            circles. Publicity of the statements would do no good and might cause
                            friction over a matter which is already sufficiently difficult and
                            delicate.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion the feeling of the Mexican Government is considerably
                            stronger than it permits itself to express at this juncture when it
                            still hopes we can solve the problem. I do not think there is the
                            slightest doubt that if through domestic laws and regulations we
                            undermine an international agreement such as that permitting us to
                            recruit labor here under conditions, the Mexican Government will be
                            justifiably indignant and will denounce the agreement. Moreover there is
                            no doubt that the Mexican Government will intensify the measures which
                            we understand from border sources have already been introduced to
                            prevent the exodus of laborers whose departure from Mexico is not
                            authorized. If the advocates of breaking down border controls persist in
                            their present policy and actions they will defeat their own purposes
                            because of the extreme likelihood that the number of laborers from
                            Mexico to the United States will be reduced to a mere trickle regardless
                            of whether high or low wages are paid.</p>
                        <p>I cannot too strongly urge upon the Department the great necessity for
                            immediate drastic action to prevent what appears to be an abuse. Apart
                            from the fact that we shall not be able to obtain labor which we
                            allegedly seriously need there is involved the highly important factor
                            of the good faith of the United States towards Mexico.</p>
                        <p>We have information from border sources that both Nogales and El Paso are
                            now “wide open”.</p>
                        <p>It will be greatly appreciated if the Department will make every effort
                            to remedy this situation as soon as possible and keep us promptly and
                            fully informed.</p>

                        <p>I immediately communicated the contents of your telegram to an official
                            of the Immigration and Naturalization Service with whom we have been
                            dealing on this matter, and he said in comment that we should not think
                            for a moment that Immigration is not in entire accord with our point of
                            view on this matter. He said that he believed the order given to border
                            immigration officials yesterday, May 14, to suspend any documentation
                            under the afore-mentioned regulations took care of the situation for the
                            time being, and that the order would not be modified until word was
                            received from Mr. Travers of VD<note n="23" xml:id="d461fn23">Howard

                            is apparent that Immigration now realizes that the regulations published

                        <p>491. The Undersecretary of Foreign Relations<note n="25"
                                xml:id="d462fn25">Jaime Torres Bodet.</note> has just informed me
                            that the Mexican Ambassador in Washington<note n="26" xml:id="d462fn26"
                                >Francisco Castillo Nájera.</note> has been instructed to call on
                            Undersecretary Welles without delay and to state that the movement of
                            Mexicans across the border and who are being admitted by our immigration
                            officials has reached such proportions that the Ministry of Gobernacíon
                            is considering closing the border. The Mexican Ambassador was instructed
                            to say to Undersecretary Welles that this movement of labor was contrary
                            to the letter and spirit of the agreements which have been entered into
                            through the exchange of notes between our two Governments and if this
                            movement was permitted to continue the Mexican Government would
                            unhappily be under the necessity of denouncing the two agreements and
                            closing the border.</p>
                        <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0567"/>
                        <p>I told the Undersecretary how much value my Government placed on these
                            agreements and how much it wished them to remain in force and the
                            Undersecretary replied that this same desire was shared by his
                            Government but that the Mexican Government would be forced to take the
                            foregoing action if the movement of laborers was not restricted to the
                            terms of the two agreements which we have entered into.</p>
                        <p>As the Department is aware I have consistently indicated that this was
                            the only attitude which the Mexican Government would be able to take and
                            there is no doubt that if this movement of workers is not stopped
                            forthwith outside of the agreements, the agreements will be shortly
                            denounced by the Mexican Government and the border will be closed to the
                            movement of Mexican workers to the United States. The Mexican Government
                            does not feel that it can take the risks involved to our relationships
                            through the movement of workers except under these agreements, as the
                            inevitable exploitation of workers outside of the agreements would force
                            the Government to such action.</p>

                        <p>848. Reference telephone conversation May 24, 1943, between Mr. Long<note
                                n="27" xml:id="d463fn27">Breckinridge Long, Assistant Secretary of

                            securing of agricultural workers from Mexico, the representative of the
                            Immigration Service stated that in view of the exceptions taken by the
                            Mexican Government to the admission of Mexican agricultural workers on
                            an individual basis under Public Law 45, the Attorney General would
                            issue appropriate instructions to limit the movement of Mexican workers
                            to the United States to those covered by existing agreements.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the War Food Administration then stressed the
                            urgency of immediately increasing the flow of workers under the
                            agricultural agreement, and asked the Department to approach the Mexican
                            Government to request: <list>

                            above, it is the understanding of the Department that the contracting of
                            the 6,000 non-agricultural workers agreed upon will be completed on June
                            9, probably before a selecting center can be set up at Guadalajara.
                            However, the War Manpower Commission has informally stated that it is
                            preparing to request the Department to transmit to the Mexican
                            Government a request for 2,000 more railroad workers and 1,000 unskilled
                            non-ferrous mine workers. The War Food Administration has stated that it
                            will supervise the selecting of workers under both agreements at
                            Guadalajara as is now the case in Mexico City.</p>
                        <p>You are authorized to inform the Mexican Foreign Office of the
                            above-mentioned assurance given by the Department of Justice, and at the

                            of immigration, “Effective immediately, nationals of Mexico are not to
                            be admitted as agricultural workers under the provisions of Public Law
                            45 and Regulations 8C4115 unless they present written consent of the
                            Federal Government of Mexico to emigrate for that purpose.”</p>

                            Department’s airmail instruction No. 3423 of June 5, 1943<note n="28"
                                xml:id="d465fn28">Not printed.</note> stating that a number of
                            industrial <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0569"/>employers of
                            relatively small groups of workers in the United States are continually
                            approaching the Department and other interested agencies with a view to
                            securing workers from Mexico. It is added that the Department
                            understands that any movement of Mexican workers to the United States
                            outside of the work Agreements between the two Governments is opposed by
                            the Mexican Government. The Embassy’s comments concerning such an
                            understanding are desired.</p>
                        <p>The Mexican Government has made it clear both in discussions leading up
                            to the Agreements and in connection with the implementation of the
                            Agreements that it is firmly and unalterably opposed to Mexican workers
                            proceeding to the United States except under the strict terms of the
                            Agreements. The Mexican Government recalls most vividly the situation
                            which was allowed to develop during the last war when thousands of
                            Mexican workers crossed into the United States without any guarantees.
                            For many years following the war the Mexican Government was forced to
                            defray the cost of repatriation of these citizens who, when the market
                            no longer existed in the United States, became unemployed, impoverished,
                            and destitute. The Mexican Government has no intention of allowing a
                            similar situation to develop and, therefore, would naturally be opposed
                            to any situation which did not foresee the granting of full guarantees
                            to Mexican workers.</p>
                        <p>At the time when negotiations for the non-agricultural Agreement were
                            started it was agreed by those participating in the discussions that it
                            would be best to so phrase the over-all agreement as to make it
                            applicable to various types of non-agricultural workers. Although at
                            that time the urgent demand was for track workers, it was none the less
                            made clear to the Mexican Government that there might be a need for
                            non-ferrous mine workers working in open pits. However, the stress was
                            always laid on the fact that unskilled labor was desired. As the
                            Department is aware the 6,000 non-agricultural workers, the need for
                            which has been certified, will have been contracted by June 15 and the
                            Embassy is anxiously awaiting further certifications in order that there
                            may be no gap in recruiting of this type of labor. The Department has
                            already informed the Embassy that one of the certifications which will
                            be sent shortly is for 1,000 non-ferrous mine workers. Since the Mexican
                            Government has not so far formally agreed to sending mine workers it
                            will be necessary to secure its assent. The Embassy, therefore, feels
                            that the matter mentioned in the Department’s instruction No. 3423 under
                            acknowledgment of the sending of workers outside the Agreements for
                            certain specified industrial work is better left unmentioned so far as
                            the Mexican Government <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0570"/>is
                            concerned or at least until the Embassy has obtained its consent to the
                            recruiting of mine workers.</p>

                        <p>Mr. McGregor telephoned at 5:40 to say the question of authorization by
                            the Mexican Government for the contracting of additional
                            non-agricultural workers was still being held up. He said that today was
                            the President’s birthday and that he left town yesterday and would not
                            be back until tomorrow and that the Minister of Labor had therefore not
                            been able to see him today. Mr. McGregor said that the Minister of Labor
                            thought that since the subject of the 6,000 non-agricultural workers
                            already contracted had been cleared with the President, the request for
                            an additional 15,000 should also be cleared with him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McGregor said that he was following the matter very closely and that
                            he would telephone the minute he had definite word on the subject. I
                            thanked him for calling and said that War Manpower and other interested
                            agencies were calling the Department several times a day on this subject
                            and that his call and assurance were especially helpful.</p>

                            State under existing agreements because of the prevalence of

                        <p>This situation has been rumored for some time but is only now confirmed
                            in connection with special efforts made by Judge Briggs<note n="31"
                                xml:id="d467fn31">Judge Cullen Briggs, Nueces County, Texas.</note>
                            of Texas in Mexico City to arrange for workers for Texas. Foreign
                            Minister Padilla said that if the situation with respect to
                            discrimination in Texas improved, he would be glad to have the attitude
                            of the Mexican Government reconsidered.</p>
                        <p>Judge Briggs told the Mexican Government and our Embassy that he would
                            take the matter up with Governor Stevenson.<note n="32"
                                xml:id="d467fn32">Governor Coke R. Stevenson of Texas.</note> One
                            step suggested by Judge Briggs was the writing of a letter on the
                            subject by Governor Stevenson to the appropriate Mexican officials, and
                            a draft copy thereof was prepared with the counsel of the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>A step taken by the Governor, at the insistence of Judge Briggs,
                            according to airgram A–57 of June 26 from Consul General Blocker,<note
                                n="33" xml:id="d467fn33">Airgram not printed.</note> was a
                            proclamation on the Good Neighbor Policy dated June 25 for publication
                            in all Texas papers. Attached is a clipping from <hi rend="italic">La

                            legislature and signed by the Governor on May 6, last, and which was the
                            subject of RA–Me’s<note n="34" xml:id="d467fn34">Mexican section of the

                        <p>The Ambassador invites attention to the fact that so far no Mexican
                            agricultural workers have been certified for Texas, and that such
                            certification if made from now on will raise this worker-racial
                            discrimination question in concrete form. It is therefore interesting to
                            note that Judge Briggs approached the War Food Administration yesterday
                            to take up the question of securing workers.</p>

                            because the Mexican Government is under the necessity of refusing

                            1942. Mr. Tello added that such movement of families would be deemed

                        </table>
                        <p>Judge Briggs came in late yesterday afternoon at the suggestion of
                            Congressman Kleberg<note n="38" xml:id="d469fn38">Richard M. Kleberg of
                                Texas.</note> and outlined the efforts he had made in Mexico City,
                            San Antonio and Austin toward smoothing the way for Texas to secure
                            agricultural workers from Mexico under the agreement of August 4, 1942.
                            He said that the Governor of Texas had issued a proclamation based on
                            the concurrent resolution of the Texas Legislature, proclaiming the Good
                            Neighbor Policy as the public policy of the State of Texas. He stated
                            that the Governor is willing to take further steps to combat racial
                            discrimination in Texas to satisfy the Mexican Government, which was
                            opposing the movement of workers to Texas because of its belief that
                            discrimination against Mexicans there was excessive.</p>
                        <p>Judge Briggs said that in Washington he had taken the question up with
                            officials of the War Food Administration and others and that two things
                            were now being done in Texas looking toward an early formal <pb n="559"
                                xml:id="pg_559" facs="0573"/>request for Mexican workers: (1) the
                            Extension Service in Texas was being asked to certify the shortage of
                            workers in Texas and the need to bring them in from Mexico, and (2) a
                            fund was being raised by interested growers which would be used in
                            combating racial discrimination, if necessary through the courts. He
                            stated that it was his opinion that the Concurrent Resolution of May 7
                            and the Governor’s proclamation of June 25 would support civil cases on
                            this subject.</p>
                        <p>Judge Briggs impressed the officers of the Department with his sincerity
                            and his determination both to get workers from Mexico for Texas and to
                            see that racial discrimination was removed as an obstacle to their
                            coming.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McGurk reviewed for Judge Briggs the development of the agreements to
                            secure workers from Mexico, emphasizing the insistence of the Mexican
                            Government on certain of the conditions contained therein which were
                            held necessary for the protection of the workers and to avoid abuses
                            which might adversely affect friendly relations between the two
                            countries.</p>

                        <p>I discussed the last paragraph of Ambassador Messersmith’s telegram no.

                                xml:id="d470fn39">Not printed.</note> with Mr. Stephen Wood of the

                            Motley, Chief of that Division, being at the moment in California.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wood stated that he had personally been in the Southwest several
                            weeks ago on this question and that he had been assured by War
                            Manpower’s regional representative and by a representative of Mine
                            Management that discriminatory practices against Mexicans had been
                            practically eliminated. He added that they were also determined to
                            eliminate any discriminatory practices the moment they might be brought
                            to light. Mr. Wood authorized us to quote the War Manpower Commission as
                            follows: “You can be assured that no wage differentials exist, and that
                            if any are discovered in practice no Mexican workers will be assigned to
                            those mines.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wood authorized us to renew the offer for Mr. Motley to meet Señor
                            Padilla Nervo, Oficial Mayor of the Mexican Department of Labor, at
                            Phoenix, Arizona, to go over the question with him in the presence of
                            the local Labor Management Committee for that region. <pb n="560"
                                xml:id="pg_560" facs="0574"/>Mr. Motley, as stated above, is now in
                            San Francisco, California, and can go to Phoenix at a moment’s
                            notice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wood said that 1,500 workers for Arizona and 500 for New Mexico would
                            meet the immediate critical need for workers and that the War Manpower
                            Commission had in mind that they would be unskilled, that is, pick and
                            shovel workers.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Joe</hi>: The appended very long letter of July
                                19th,<note n="42" xml:id="d472fn42">Not found in Department
                                files.</note> on the situation with regard to workers for Texas, was
                            dictated on Sunday. On Monday, the 19th, Padilla asked me to the Foreign
                            Office to talk over a number of things, and he had before him the letter
                            from the Governor of Texas addressed to him on this labor matter and
                                discriminations.<note n="43" xml:id="d472fn43">For the letter from
                                Governor Coke R. Stevenson to Minister Padilla, dated July 12, and
                                the latter’s reply of July 20, see Mexico, <hi rend="italic">Memoria
                                    de la Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores</hi>, 1942–1943, pp.
                                507–512.</note>
                            <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0575"/>Padilla said that Torres Bodet
                            had informed him fully concerning the conversation which we had had a
                            day or two before, and which is covered in my letter of July 19 hereto
                            appended. Padilla said that he was in thorough agreement, of course,
                            with what Torres Bodet had said concerning the difficulty of Mexico
                            changing her position with regard to workers going to Texas. He also
                            knew my thorough understanding of all the factors involved in the
                            problem here and at home. It was unfortunate that this question of
                            workers had arisen at this time when it was so difficult for Mexico to
                            change her position but he had been giving the matter very careful
                            thought since a long conversation which we had had some ten days ago,
                            and he was very much influenced by the thought that failure of Mexico to
                            let workers go might bring about a reaction of public opinion in Texas
                            which would delay the solution of these problems of discriminations. He
                            said that if they really needed these workers in Texas, and the Mexican
                            Government did not let them go, and in this way discriminated against
                            Texas, no matter what good reason she had for doing so, and it had such
                            good reason, the refusal of Mexico could easily create a very bad
                            popular opinion and reaction in Texas both among Government officials
                            and among the people and thus bring about an exaggeration and perhaps an
                            increase in discriminations.</p>
                        <p>He said that the interest of the Mexican Government, like ours, was to
                            eliminate these discriminations as rapidly as possible. He thought that
                                [<hi rend="italic">there</hi>] were many things that the State
                            Government, and officials, and people of Texas could do to remove these
                            discriminations, which they had not done. He realized, however, their
                            problem and he realized that there was good will among State officials
                            and responsible people in Texas to remedy the situation which could not
                            be done in a day. He thought, therefore, that neither Government should
                            do anything to, in any way, exaggerate this situation or to give
                            possible rise to renewed and increased discriminations by thoughtless
                            and more or less irresponsible people whom it was difficult to
                            control.</p>
                        <p>I can only tell you that the remarks of Padilla, which I have given only
                            briefly, have even increased my opinion of him as a statesman. He is
                            really a statesman and a man of great understanding and, in addition to
                            that, is sincere in his desire to solve these problems. I told Padilla
                            that while I had not mentioned the phase of the matter which he had just
                            gone into that in my opinion it was the most important factor of all. I
                            told him that I thought the best purposes of both Governments would be
                            served by removing the ban on Texas—without regard as to whether there
                            was any immediate need for the <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0576"
                            />labor or not. I said that I had not mentioned this phase either to him
                            or to Torres Bodet, but that it was the one factor in the Mexican order
                            which really disturbed me, because if it were generally known in Texas
                            that there is this ban, and Mexico persisted in it in spite of a real or
                            apparent need for Mexican labor to save the cotton crop, it could easily
                            result in a wave of resentment in Texas and interfere with the sound
                            program which the State Government and sound people in Texas were trying
                            to carry through. Padilla said that he was very much inclined to remove
                            the ban and to run the risks of the local difficulties they might have
                            here. He said he would talk with the President. With his support of his
                            point of view he was sure that he could carry it over successfully here
                            in Mexico. He said he would let me know as soon as he had talked with
                            the President.</p>
                        <p>I wanted to get this additional word to you without delay. If the
                            Mexicans do remove the ban, then we must make the most of it and will
                            have to get some generous reactions in Texas, for it will really be a
                            statesman-like act and a generous act on the part of Mexico, the
                            importance of which, it is necessary that the War Manpower Commission,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Justice Byrnes</hi>: Following our
                            conversation of July 22 regarding the urgent need for hard rock miners
                            in the United States, I telegraphed Ambassador Messersmith in Mexico
                            City asking him whether a personal appeal from President Roosevelt to
                            the President of Mexico might produce a change in the negative attitude
                            of the Mexican Government regarding this matter.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Messersmith has now informed me that while he is fully
                            conscious of the emergency with which you were confronted, it is his
                            considered opinion that it would be utterly impossible for the President
                            of Mexico to alter the position which he has previously taken in this
                            matter. The Ambassador feels that an appeal of the type contemplated
                            would be most embarrassing to the President since he would be obliged to
                            reject it. The Ambassador adds that President Avila Camacho has been
                            following the labor situation in Mexico with the very greatest care and
                            that it is his judgment and that of his advisers that any movement of
                            mine labor such as that proposed would have a most upsetting effect upon
                            the labor situation and would also seriously prejudice the production of
                            strategic minerals in Mexico.</p>
                        <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0577"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador has asked me to assure you and Mr. McNutt of his deep
                            personal interest in this matter, and of his knowledge of and sympathy
                            with the problems with which you are confronted. In order to go further
                            into this subject he would be glad to have some person whom you might
                            wish to designate proceed to Mexico in order to discuss it with him. He
                            feels, of course, that if you should decide to send such a person, no
                            publicity should be given to his travel and the entire matter should be
                            handled with the greatest discretion.</p>

                            available because of the reported prevalence of racial discrimination

                            In reading this memorandum you will no doubt note that it contains
                            several incidents described in the communication which Dr. Padilla
                            recently wrote to the Governor of Texas for delivery by Messrs. Blocker
                            and McGregor. You will also no doubt share the opinion of the Department
                            that the delivery of this memorandum to the Secretary on July 24 by the
                            Mexican Ambassador, who came in at his request, is evidence that the
                            Mexican Government is using the request of Texas for Mexican
                            agricultural workers as the occasion for a strong drive to secure
                            energetic measures on the part of this Government to put an end to
                            racial discrimination.</p>

                            the following procedure was decided upon: 1) the Governor will address a
                            letter to all law enforcement agencies in the State of Texas calling
                            upon them to be especially vigilant in repressing cases of
                            discrimination against Mexicans as they arise (a copy of the letter is
                            an appendix to enclosure 5); 2) the text of such a letter having already
                            been cleared with the Mexican Foreign Minister and to be published in
                            Texas at a later date, the Foreign Minister agreed to two things: <hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) to entertain and approve the Embassy’s request
                            for certification of 5,000 Mexican workers for Texas provided some way
                            may be found to avoid such labor moving directly from Mexico to Texas,
                            and <hi rend="italic">b</hi>) to the simultaneous publication in Texas
                            and Mexico of the exchange of notes between the Governor and the
                            Minister. This last took place on July 29, 1943 and has already been the
                            subject of despatches Nos. 11,860 of that date and 12,012 of August 4,
                                1943.<note n="52" xml:id="d476fn53">Neither printed.</note> 3) The
                            formation of a Good Neighbor Commission by the Governor of Texas. This
                            Commission would receive complaints of discriminations and, working
                            through established civic organizations in Texas, such as the Chambers
                            of Commerce, Boards of Education and Parent-Teachers Organizations,
                            would carry on effective propaganda work of an educational nature. The
                            Governor will publicly announce the composition of this Commission about
                            August 10, 1943. 4) The Governor has tentatively accepted an invitation
                            conveyed to him informally by Mr. McGregor at the request of Dr. Padilla
                            to attend the Independence Day celebrations in Mexico City as a guest of
                            the Mexican Government. At this time an opportunity will be afforded for
                            discussions of this matter of discriminations.</p>
                        <p>I have noted with a great deal of interest the memorandum dated July 23,
                            1943 handed by the Mexican Ambassador to the Secretary of State on July
                                24,<note n="53" xml:id="d476fn54">Not printed, but see footnote 48,

                            sent with the Department’s instruction No. 3871 of July 31, 1943. Most
                            of the facts alleging discrimination found in the memorandum of the
                            Mexican Embassy are taken textually from a report prepared by the
                            Mexican Consul in Austin, Texas, Mr. Luis L. Duplan. This report was
                            originally drawn up in the form of a letter addressed by the Consul to
                            Dr. George I. Sanchez, a professor at the University of Texas and a
                            member of the Committee on Inter-American Relations in the Southwest.
                            The letter of the Consul was dated April 23, 1943. The fact that the
                            Mexican <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0580"/>Embassy waited three
                            months to use the facts assembled in the letter would seem to bear out
                            the contention of the Department in its instruction No. 3871 that the
                            Mexican Government is using the request of Texas for workers as an
                            excuse for bringing up the major issue of discrimination.</p>
                        <p>I have reason to know, however, that if it had not been for the
                            statesmanlike vision of the Mexican Foreign Minister and the President
                            this matter of discrimination would have been permitted to fester in the
                            body politic here. When I first raised this question of labor to Texas
                            with the Under Secretary of Foreign Relations, Dr. Torres Bodet, he made
                            it very clear that he did not consider that such a matter should be
                            presented at this time. The Minister, however, saw clearly that unless
                            this very fundamental problem of discrimination was tackled now, during
                            the war, when relations between our two countries are so closely
                            interconnected, the opportunity to tackle it later might not recur or,
                            if it did, not under such favorable circumstances. The Minister
                            obviously saw that there are powerful influences in Texas which are
                            bringing pressure on the Governor for this labor; he believed that the
                            Governor even if he was not disposed to do anything about discrimination
                            on humanitarian grounds, might be forced to do something about it if the
                            furnishing of Mexican labor was made contingent upon it. The Minister
                            also had the vision to see that relations between Texas and Mexico would
                            not improve but would get worse if he denied a petition of this
                            sort.…</p>

                        <p>The Department asks me to comment on the memorandum which the Mexican
                            Ambassador handed to the Secretary. I believe the Department could use
                            this despatch and its enclosures as the basis for a reply to the Mexican
                            Ambassador setting forth therein the steps already taken by the Governor
                            of Texas to handle cases of discrimination as they arise there. I
                            understand that the Coordinator’s Office has established an agency in
                            Austin headed by a competent person to work with established agencies of
                            the Texas State Government to bring an understanding of this problem to
                            the people of the State of Texas. Mention might be made of the tireless
                            work performed quietly by United States Consular officers (particularly
                            Consul General Blocker) along the border. The Foreign Minister has
                            received an entirely personal note from the Governor, a copy of which is
                                attached,<note n="54" xml:id="d476fn55">Letter of July 12; see
                                footnote 43, <ref target="#pg_561">p. 561</ref>.</note> which should
                            dispel from his mind any idea that might have been falsely planted there
                            that the Governor of Texas is not sincere in his desire to collaborate.
                            At the same time I believe it should be made clear to the Mexican
                            Ambassador that the solving of <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0581"
                            />this problem is one which depends upon the mutual collaboration of all
                            the officials involved. The feeling exists in Texas and I believe it can
                            be borne out by evidence, that Mexican Consuls are being over zealous in
                            the exercise of their protective functions. Entirely too much publicity
                            of an adverse nature pertaining to cases of discrimination can be
                            directly traced to Mexican Consular officials. This only magnifies the
                            problem and disturbs the work of agencies who must work carefully and
                            quietly to be efficient.…</p>

                        <p>Mr. McGregor telephoned about 7:00 last night to state that there was
                            much concern in Mexico City regarding the contracting of agricultural
                            workers for the United States, because <hi rend="italic"
                                >campesinos</hi><note n="55" xml:id="d477fn55">Rural workers.</note>
                            were leaving their properties, and because of the way applicants for
                            contracts were piling up in Mexico City creating many housing,
                            sanitation and other problems. He said that on August 5 the Government
                            started to weed out from the applicants all those from the states of
                            Michoacan, Guanajuato and Jalisco, and to send them back home (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) to reduce the problem in Mexico City, (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) to have them spread the word in those states
                            that no more jobs were available thus discouraging further influx of
                            workers to Mexico City and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) to prevent crop
                            losses from abandoned lands. (Probably 95 per cent of the experienced
                            candidates for contracts are from those three states).</p>
                        <p>Mr. McGregor said that Mr. Brown, Chief of the Selection Station, was
                            beginning to have his source of labor dry up.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador called upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs and was given
                            a memorandum in which the Mexican Government presented two alternatives: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>The Mexican Government would return genuine <hi rend="italic"

                                        rend="italic">residence</hi>] at the risk of having them
                                    disseminate scepticism about the prospects in Mexico
                                    City.</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                <item>The rate of contracting should be stepped up from 2500 to 6000
                                    a week.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>After studying the memorandum the Ambassador and Messrs. Brown and
                            McGregor called on the Foreign Minister. The Ambassador <pb n="568"
                                xml:id="pg_568" facs="0582"/>told the Foreign Minister that we would
                            try to settle the problem by the second alternative, duplication of the
                            rate of recruiting. He said, however, that this involved many
                            difficulties, one of which could be solved by placing the recruiting
                            facilities on a two shift basis. Another major difficulty,
                            transportation, was discussed and the Foreign Minister stated that if
                            the recruiting were speeded up the transportation problem in Mexico
                            could be taken care of by the Mexican Government.</p>
                        <p>In considering this problem it was also pointed out that approximately
                            38,000 agricultural workers have been contracted to date leaving a
                            balance of 12,000 to be contracted during August. The Foreign Minister
                            indicated that there would be no objection to increasing this number of
                            workers provided the existing instructions were changed to permit the
                            recruiting of physically capable workers but with no farm experience.
                            With such workers made acceptable, Dr. Padilla stated that there would
                            be no difficulty in getting more than the 50,000 workers agreed
                            upon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McGregor then said that it was the considered opinion there that if
                            plan (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) were not adopted, all recruiting in
                            Mexico City would fold up in about two weeks. He hastened to point out
                            that this statement was in no way an ultimatum.</p>
                        <p>I asked him how long recruiting could be expected to hold up on a double
                            shift basis. Mr. McGregor replied that if the War Food Administration
                            would lower its requirements, an unlimited number of physically capable
                            workers would be available and that recruiting could go on for six,
                            eight or ten weeks or even more. He emphasized that the War Food
                            Administration could be assured of getting good physical specimens. Mr.
                            McGregor then again stressed the point that the Mexican Government has
                            no desire to force this matter as an issue but was under the obligation
                            of presenting these alternatives in order to handle a most difficult
                            internal problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McGregor then informed me of the contents of the Embassy’s telegram
                            no. 784 of August 6<note n="56" xml:id="d477fn56">Not printed.</note>
                            which had just been filed for the Department and called particular
                            attention to the statement therein that the 5000 workers for Texas
                            should form a part of any stepped up recruiting program for August and
                            that this was particularily important because of the discussions with
                            the Governor of Texas which resulted in an understanding looking to the
                            control and eventual wiping out of discrimination in Texas.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McGregor stated that Mr. Brown had studied the personnel needs which
                            must be met in the event of establishing a second selecting and
                            contracting shift. The list follows:</p>

                            so many adverse reports of poor treatment of Mexican track workers are
                            being received from Mexican Consuls and workers themselves that the
                            Mexican Government has gone as far as to consider denouncing the
                            agreement with the War Manpower Commission, dated April 29, 1943. Mr.
                            Tello said that in addition to the wage difficulty with the Santa Fe
                            Railroad concerning which the Mexican Government feels it has received
                            no satisfaction, complaints are being received daily alleging poor food
                            and lodgings, lack of sanitation and in general inadequate disposition
                            on the part of those responsible for administering the program to
                            consider the welfare of the workers. Mr. Tello added that he had
                            prepared telegraphic instructions to the Mexican Embassy at Washington
                            to make urgent and pressing representations to the State Department
                            seeking a transfer of all track workers now in the U. S. to either
                            various industries or agriculture.</p>
                        <p>The officer of the Embassy made it clear that the U. S. Government would
                            consider it most unfortunate if the track worker program had to
                            terminate for the reasons set forth by Mr. Tello; that an opportunity to
                            discuss difficulties should be afforded and a way found to avoid or to
                            remedy.</p>
                        <p>The officer suggested that rather than place the matter in the hands of
                            the Mexican Embassy it might be better to have a qualified
                            representative of the War Manpower Commission come down here to take
                            part in such discussions. Mr. Tello seemed pleased with the <pb n="570"
                                xml:id="pg_570" facs="0584"/>suggestion and added that the Mexican
                            Government for its part would consider requesting its Inspector General
                            of Consulates in the U. S. to come to Mexico City for the proposed
                            deliberations.</p>
                        <p>There can be no doubt that the Mexican Government is seriously concerned
                            over the treatment of its track workers in the U. S. Mr. Tello says that
                            he and other Mexican officials are delighted with the manner in which
                            the Mexican farm labor is being handled but the fact that this latter
                            type of labor is so well treated makes the position of the track labor
                            all the more impossible. It was pointed out to Mr. Tello that the
                            sincerity and desire on the part of the War Manpower Commission to carry
                            out to the full its commitments under the agreement should not be
                            doubted and that therefore, there must be some way by which the major
                            objects of the Mexican Government can be met.</p>
                        <p>In view of the attitude of the Mexican Government I consider it of the
                            utmost importance that someone high in the War Manpower Commission with
                            a knowledge of the workings of the agreement and authority to speak in
                            the name of the Commission come to Mexico City as soon as possible in
                            order to participate in these discussions. I will appreciate an urgent
                            reply to this message.</p>

                        <p>962. As a result of my conversations with the President and the Ministry
                            of Foreign Relations we have secured authorization to recruit
                            agricultural workers up to 70,000 which I think we can get augmented to
                            75,000 shortly. We can proceed with commitments at home and recruitment
                            here on this basis.</p>
                        <p>I also have a tentative authorization to increase the recruitment of
                            railway workers by at least 5,000 but before we can proceed with this
                            certain situations, which have arisen with respect to the railway
                            workers and with which the Mexican authorities are definitely
                            dissatisfied, will have to be clarified. There can for the moment be no
                            further recruitment of railway workers.</p>
                        <p>I have covered the whole situation in a full despatch number 13,283 of

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Ambassador</hi>: I acknowledge the
                            receipt of your letter and despatch of September 29, 1943,<note n="59"
                                xml:id="d480fn59">Neither printed.</note> regarding the increased
                            quotas for Mexican workers which have been established as a result of
                            your conversations with President Avila Camacho. These quotas and
                            especially the refillable basis on which they now stand represent real
                            progress in the manpower situation.</p>
                        <p>The War Food Administration has been informed of the new figure on the
                            basis of your telegram no. 962 of September 30, 1943, and Colonel Bruton
                            has requested that sincere appreciation be passed along to you. He
                            stated that the Administration has currently under study the question of
                            the number and distribution of agricultural workers which will be needed
                            in the next few months. He indicated that present estimates are that
                            only about 20,000 workers will be utilized in agriculture throughout the
                            winter, and the studies being made are to provide for the others now
                            here and those who may come in the next few weeks. The War Food
                            Administration and the War Manpower Commission hope to hit upon an
                            arrangement satisfactory to the Mexican Government to provide work in
                            other industries during the winter for those workers not needed in
                            agriculture. It has been stressed to them that any plans made must be
                            cleared with the Mexican Government.</p>
                        <p>The railroad problem, however, from all indications, is serious. From the
                            Embassy’s despatch no. 12,987 of September 13, 1943,<note n="60"
                                xml:id="d480fn60">Not printed.</note> which reports the discussions
                            held in Mexico City between representatives of the two Governments, I
                            note that the basic point of difference is the question of salaries paid
                            to Mexican workers by the railroads. Apparently early in the
                            conversations the Mexicans made the point that these salaries were
                            discriminatory because higher salaries were being paid in certain
                            regions to other workers who were doing the same type of work but as
                            employees of contracting companies. The fifth and last paragraphs of the
                            memorandum of the last meeting with the Mexicans, enclosure two of the
                            despatch under reference, indicate that the Mexicans sustained their
                            demand for wage increases which were not in the power of the
                            representatives of this Government to give.</p>
                        <p>In this regard I note that Mr. Motley<note n="61" xml:id="d480fn61">Chief
                                of Employment Office Service Division, War Manpower Commission, and
                                participant in the stalemated conversations at Mexico City on
                                recruitment and wages.</note> pointed out to the Mexicans that this
                            Government did not consider the wages discriminatory since <pb n="572"
                                xml:id="pg_572" facs="0586"/>they were the same as those paid to the
                            105,000 track workers who do this particular job with the Mexicans. He
                            also stressed the fact that these wage rates were frozen under the
                            President’s hold the line order, and that the War Manpower Commission
                            was therefore unable to meet the Mexican demands for increased
                            wages.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Motley also told them that a proposal to increase wages for track
                            workers by eight cents an hour had been submitted to the President. It
                            was probably the hope of the War Manpower Commission that this increase,
                            involving back pay of approximately $100.00 for the majority of Mexican
                            railroad workers, would help in securing the withdrawal of Mexican
                            objections to wages at present levels. However, Office of Defense
                            Transportation representatives have now informed the Department that Mr.
                                Vinson<note n="62" xml:id="d480fn62">Fred M. Vinson, Director of the
                                Office of Economic Stabilization.</note> has stopped this proposal.
                            It is possible that the portion of the proposal referring to track
                            workers will receive further consideration, but it is now too late for
                            any psychological benefit to be derived therefrom.</p>
                        <p>The fact must therefore be faced by the interested agencies of this
                            Government, who continue to press the Department to secure more workers
                            from Mexico, that a way must be found to meet the Mexican demands. To
                            bring this matter before these agencies a letter is being addressed to
                            Governor McNutt, a copy of which is enclosed.<note n="63"
                                xml:id="d480fn63">Not found in Department files.</note> You will
                            note that he is being informed of your suggestion that representatives
                            of the Commission go to Mexico to continue discussion of the points at
                            issue. It is then stated, however, that it is the Department’s opinion
                            that a continuation of the discussions will not be productive of further
                            workers unless such representatives are empowered to meet the Mexican
                            wage demands at least to the extent of placing these railroad workers on
                            a wage par with the Mexican agricultural workers in California who
                            receive a minimum of about sixty cents.</p>
                        <p>With cordial regards,</p>

                            Transportation, has consistently held that it is impossible to meet the
                            Mexican demand that wage adjustments be given certain workers on the
                            Santa Fe Railroad who for a time worked beside employees of a
                            contracting company who received much higher pay. The number of workers
                            is comparatively small, perhaps 200, and the amount involved has been
                            estimated as from $20,000 to $50,000. The agencies mentioned hold that
                            no wage adjustment can be made for workers, Mexican or domestic, except
                            through the procedure set up under the Railway Labor Act<note n="66"
                                xml:id="d481fn66">Act of June 21, 1934; 48 Stat. 1185.</note> and
                            have pointed to the President’s “hold the line” order<note n="67"
                                xml:id="d481fn67">Executive Order No. 9250, October 3, 1942, on

                            an adjustment. This situation is explained in Governor McNutt’s letter
                            of October 28 and Mr. Joseph B. Eastman’s letter of October 13,<note
                                n="68" xml:id="d481fn68">Neither printed.</note> both of which
                            stressed that it was hoped that the Mexican Government would realize
                            this difficulty and would permit contracting and renewal of contracts to
                            proceed. The letters also stated that while no special adjustment could
                            be arranged, every effort was being made to secure a blanket increase of
                            wages for all maintenance of way workers, domestic and Mexican, of at
                            least eight cents per hour.</p>

                                printed.</note> which stated that he had proposed to the Mexican
                            Government the formation of a commission of two representatives from
                            each Government to “determine names and amounts and that the Santa Fe
                            would assume responsibility for this particular compensation to the
                            particular workers”. The Ambassador stated that the <pb n="574"
                                xml:id="pg_574" facs="0588"/>Mexican Foreign Office had informed him
                            in reply to his proposal “that if agreement was reached to the naming of
                            such a committee and agreement that the compensation for such workers …
                                <note n="71" xml:id="d481fn71">Omissions indicated in the original
                                memorandum.</note> would be paid … the Mexican Government would
                            remove objections to the further recruitment of Mexican labor … and
                            would also permit the renewal of the contracts of such track workers in
                            the United States who wished to remain”.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy advised me of the above proposal by telephone on October 30,
                            at which time I said that the Department’s instruction on this subject,
                            the general nature of which had been previously invited to the attention
                            of the Embassy, was en route. I expressed serious doubts that this
                            Government could agree to a commission for the objectives proposed.</p>
                        <p>The War Manpower Commission and the Office of Defense Transportation, to
                            whom copies of the Ambassador’s despatch were given on Monday November
                            1, immediately expressed grave doubts as to the possibility of accepting
                            the proposal, and a letter dated November 4 has now been received from
                            Governor McNutt<note n="72" xml:id="d481fn72">Not found in Department
                                files.</note> which states that a commission for the special
                            objective set forth by the Ambassador cannot be accepted.</p>
                        <p>Governor McNutt states that the commission is willing, however, to accept
                            the appointment of a four man commission which “would be responsible for
                            considering any differences between our two Governments as to the
                            interpretation of the existing agreement, for studying the operation of
                            the agreement with a view to making recommendations to our two
                            Governments with respect to necessary changes in the agreement, and for
                            recommending such administrative action as will minimize further
                            individual complaints”. At the same time he requested that the Mexican
                            Government be asked to give immediate consent to the renewal for 30 days
                            of Mexican railroad worker contracts which begin to expire on November
                            13.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has been informed by telephone of this counter-proposal by
                            the War Manpower Commission, and is ready to submit it to the Mexican
                            Government upon receipt of instructions from the Department. While the
                            counter-proposal has less immediate promise from the Mexican viewpoint,
                            it apparently does not exclude the possibility of an eventual settlement
                            of the Mexican claim for wage adjustment. A later and delayed settlement
                            under recommendations from the special commission might be less
                            embarrassing for the War Manpower Commission because it would be
                            distinctly on a Government <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0589"/>to
                            Government basis and it might come at a time of less tension in the
                            railroad labor wage field. The War Manpower Commission would expect to
                            have a representative on the committee, while the Department would be
                            free, apparently, to name the other representative of this
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>I recommend the establishment of the proposed commission, with duties as
                            outlined by Governor McNutt, and, subject to your approval thereof, I
                            shall authorize Ambassador Messersmith to make such an arrangement with
                            the Mexican Government.</p>

                        <p>The Embassy in Mexico City was informed late yesterday afternoon that the
                            Department authorized presentation to the Mexican Government of the War
                            Manpower Commission’s statement of functions for a proposed joint
                            mission to consider problems in regard to Mexican railroad workers.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy this morning reported that the Mexican Foreign Office reacted
                            very favorably to this counter proposition, but this afternoon at three
                            p.m. the Embassy reported by telephone that the Ministry of Labor had
                            informed the Foreign Office by telephone that it would accept no other
                            function for a joint commission than that of determining (<hi

                            workers were discriminated against as to wages on the Santa Fe, (<hi

                            settlement of the account, that it would have no further claims to make
                            regarding adjustments as long as Mexican workers were not put along side
                            of American workers who were receiving higher wages, and that no
                            objections were made to present wage rates as determined by collective
                            bargaining.</p>

                            become available for such transfer between November 1 and December 31.
                            In his letter he lists a variety of industries in which these workers
                            could perform a valuable service in the production of materials of

                            taken by the President’s Committee on Fair Employment Practices. It is
                            not clear, however, from Mr. Blocker’s despatch, a copy of which was
                            forwarded directly to the Embassy, whether action was also taken on this
                            matter by the Texas Good Neighbor Commission, to which the complaint was
                            also referred through the Governor of Texas. If a further report on this
                            matter is received from the Good Neighbor Commission the Embassy will be
                            informed thereof.</p>

                        <p>Mr. O’Donoghue<note n="79" xml:id="d485fn79">Sidney E. O’Donoghue, Second
                                Secretary of Embassy in Mexico.</note> telephoned at noon today to
                            inform the Department that the Embassy had received from the Mexican
                            Foreign Office permission for the War Manpower Commission to renew
                            contracts of Mexican railroad workers, which contracts begin to expire
                            today, and for further recruiting of 5,000 Mexican railroad workers in
                            Mexico City under the agreement of April 29, 1943. In reply to a
                            question, Mr. O’Donoghue stated that it was his understanding that the
                            permission to recruit 5,000 additional workers meant that the Mexican
                            Government agreed that 20,000 Mexican railroad workers could now be
                            maintained in this country. (This understanding is in accordance with
                            the Ambassador’s despatch no. 13,283 of September 29, 1943.)<note n="80"
                                xml:id="d485fn80">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>I told Mr. O’Donoghue that all concerned here would be very happy to have
                            this definite clearance, and that I would immediately inform the War
                            Manpower Commission that they could proceed with further recruiting in
                            Mexico City at any time and could proceed with the renewal of contracts
                            of workers now here, as those contracts expire.</p>
                        <p>Mr. O’Donoghue said that there had been some delay in securing the above
                            commitment from the Mexican Foreign Office because Mr. Manuel Tello <pb
                                n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0592"/>of the Foreign Office, who has
                            been handling the matter, had been sick and absent from the office.</p>
                        <p>Mr. O’Donoghue stated in regard to the Mexican members of the commission
                            and the place of meeting that the Mexicans had apparently not reached a
                            decision. He expected to receive this information the first of next
                            week. I told him that the clearances mentioned above were of course the
                            matter of first interest and that our representatives were ready to meet
                            the Mexican representatives at any time. He said he would inform the
                            Department as soon as further word was received from the Foreign
                            Office.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of a letter from the War Food Administration, I then asked
                            him to seek the approval of the Mexican Government to permit the
                            Administration to use up to 2,000 Mexican agricultural workers in
                            packing plants of the Pacific Northwest, which were having an
                            unprecedented receipt of cattle and which had heavy orders for allied
                            and domestic consumption to meet in the near future. I said that the War
                            Food Administration would continue to take care of these men under the
                            full terms of the international agreement of August 4, 1942, as amended
                            on April 26, 1943, and especially see that wage rates, which vary from
                            60 to 80 cents per hour according to the task performed, would be the
                            same as those paid to domestic workers in the packing plants under
                            consideration. Mr. O’Donoghue said that he would immediately present
                            this request to the Mexican Government and that he would follow this
                            request early next week with a request, the subject of a recent
                            instruction from the Department, that permission be given to transfer
                            workers from the agricultural agreement to the non-agricultural
                            agreement for railroads and industry during the next few months.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Department’s instruction no. 4739 of November 11, 1943,
                            transmitting a copy of a letter dated November 1<note n="81"
                                xml:id="d486fn81">Latter not printed.</note> from Governor Paul V.
                            McNutt, Chairman of the War Manpower Commission, in which he requests
                            that the Mexican Government be approached with a view to securing its
                            permission to the transfer of approximately 10,000 agricultural workers
                            who may not be needed during the winter months to employment under the
                            non-agricultural agreement. The Department directed <pb n="579"
                                xml:id="pg_579" facs="0593"/>me to discuss this proposal with the
                            Mexican Foreign Office with a view to securing the desired
                            permission.</p>
                        <p>In this same connection I desire to refer to the Department’s instruction
                            no. 4789 of November 17<note n="82" xml:id="d486fn82">Not
                                printed.</note> respecting the desire of the War Food Administration
                            to transfer from 1000 to 2000 surplus agricultural workers to certain
                            meat packing houses in the Pacific Northwest. The Department will recall
                            that when this question was discussed with officials of the Foreign
                            Office and the Ministry of Labor, they made it a <hi rend="italic">sine
                                qua non</hi>, before even considering the proposal, that the packing
                            plants guarantee to provide lodging and feeding facilities equivalent to
                            those which the agricultural workers enjoy under the existing
                            agricultural workers agreement.</p>
                        <p>Governor McNutt states that the War Manpower Commission is interested in
                            obtaining agricultural workers for employment in war essential
                            industries, in which there is a shortage of workers, and “which can
                            provide suitable working conditions”. He indicated that in his opinion
                            the approach to the Mexican Government should be on the basis of the
                            transfer of agricultural workers “to all war essential industries,
                            rather than to specific industries”.</p>
                        <p>I have not discussed this matter with the Mexican Government officials in
                            view of the fact that even should they prove agreeable to the transfer
                            of such agricultural workers to war essential industries, there could be
                            no guarantees given that lodgings and feeding facilities would be
                            exactly the same as those which they now have in agricultural
                            employment. It would seem to me that from the very nature of the
                            employment to which it is proposed to transfer these workers, it would
                            be impossible to provide them with the facilities which can be afforded
                            them on the farms where they are now employed.</p>
                        <p>I am likewise disturbed over the project of transferring agricultural
                            workers to non-agricultural employment, especially in war essential
                            industries. If I am not mistaken, the average wage rate of employees in
                            essential war industries is considerably higher than that paid to
                            agricultural workers. It would appear to be only reasonable to conclude
                            that when the need for agricultural workers again becomes apparent, it
                            would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to re-transfer workers
                            from essential war industries to agricultural employment. If I am
                            correct in my opinion that the need for agricultural workers is of the
                            first importance to us, then I think we should explore every possiblity
                            to locate existing surplus agricultural workers in other areas where
                            agricultural employment may be possible during the winter months.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the instruction under reference, I do not propose to take
                            any steps vis-à-vis the Mexican authorities unless otherwise directed by
                            the Department, and then only if guarantees can be given <pb n="580"
                                xml:id="pg_580" facs="0594"/>with respect to food and lodging for
                            such Mexican workers as may be transferred to war essential
                            industries.</p>

                            Mexican workers in the United States were requesting members of their
                            families in Mexico to write letters declaring that members of the family
                            in Mexico were ill and that the worker in the United States should
                            therefore return immediately. Two intercepts of this kind are
                            transmitted herewith for your reference.<note n="83" xml:id="d487fn83"

                        <p>The War Food Administration has written to the Department a letter under
                            date of November 17, 1943<note n="83" xml:id="d487fn84">Not
                                printed.</note> in which it is pointed out that the rapidly
                            increasing repatriation of Mexican nationals before completion of their
                            contracts is a matter of serious concern. The Administration points out
                            that large numbers of workers have been using various excuses to return
                            home before the expiration of their contracts, and then have promptly
                            reappeared for recruitment in Mexico City for return to this country for
                            further employment under the agricultural agreement. This practice is
                            now apparently reaching alarming proportions, and the Department concurs
                            with the statement of the War Food Administration that this Government
                            cannot continue to assume the rapidly increasing costs in terms of
                            wasted manpower, crops and travel expenses.</p>
                        <p>The communication from the War Food Administration states that many
                            requests have also been received from workers in this country who wish
                            to go home at their own expense for short vacation periods, after which
                            they would return again to this country for further employment. This
                            plan involves no direct expense for the War Food Administration, and the
                            Administration has made arrangements with the Immigration and
                            Naturalization Service so that the individual worker may re-enter the
                            United States without difficulties. There is enclosed herewith for your
                            information a copy of the War Food Administration’s letter under
                            reference, as well as copies of its enclosures, instructions and

                        <p>The War Manpower Commission has apparently been making use of a similar

                            non-agricultural agreement, according to a letter dated November 15,
                            1943 from the Acting Chief of the Bureau of Placement of the Commission,
                            a copy of which is also transmitted herewith.<note n="84"
                                xml:id="d487fn85">Not printed.</note> However, railroad workers
                            returning to Mexico under leaves of absence have encountered unexpected
                            difficulties with the Mexican immigration officials, according to the
                            War Manpower Commission. The individuals concerned have been requested
                            to pay five pesos or to turn in their passports to Mexican immigration
                            authorities. Some of the men have paid, but those who refused to do so
                            have had their passports picked up.</p>
                        <p>The War Manpower Commission requests that this matter be brought to the
                            attention of the proper officials of the Mexican Government, with a view
                            to reaching an understanding that Mexican nationals who have been
                            granted leaves of absence to visit their families in Mexico may return
                            to the United States to complete their contracts without any charges
                            being imposed by the Mexican Government for their re-entry. You are
                            therefore authorized, in your discretion, to discuss this matter with
                            the Mexican Foreign Office with a view to effecting the arrangement
                            requested. It is suggested that you may wish to make this arrangement
                            applicable to both agricultural and non-agricultural workers, although
                            the War Food Administration has not yet reported difficulties of this
                            kind.</p>

                            to make it possible for the workers to visit their families for
                            legitimate reasons without canceling their contracts and without causing
                            unjustifiable expense to this Government.</p>

                            of November 19, 1943, in answer to your communication of November 9,

                            regarding <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0596"/>the functions of a
                            four man commission to consider a claim of the Mexican Government on
                            behalf of Mexican railroad workers in this country under the agreement
                            of April 29, 1943.</p>
                        <p>I now enclose for your information a copy of despatch no. 14,248 of
                            November 16, 1943, from our Embassy at Mexico City, to which are
                            attached as enclosures copies of the notes exchanged<note n="86"
                                xml:id="d488fn86">None printed.</note> by the Embassy and the
                            Mexican Foreign Office setting up the four man commission referred to
                            and specifying the duties which are assigned to it. The note from the
                            Mexican Foreign Office expresses agreement to the renewal of individual
                            work contracts, subject to the consent of the workers themselves, and
                            refers to the contracting of 5,000 additional maintenance of way
                            workers, which, I understand, are now being selected in Mexico City.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that the Mexican Government, while accepting the duties
                            of the commission as proposed in your letter of November 9, expresses
                            the hope that the commission will not be limited to considering the
                            incident at Fullerton, California, but that the labors and the
                            competence of the commission may be made extensive to all other cases of
                            wage discrimination which may have arisen. The Embassy has been given no
                            instructions regarding this point raised by the Mexican Government since
                            it was agreed in the meeting of November 9 in the War Manpower
                            Commission that it would be best to limit this four man commission to a
                            solution of the present differences, leaving future problems to be
                            settled through usual diplomatic channels.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Department’s instruction no. 4841 of November 26, 1943,
                            stating that the War Food Administration has become concerned regarding
                            the rapidly increasing repatriation of Mexican nationals before
                            completion of their contracts. The Administration pointed out that large
                            numbers of workers had been using various excuses to return home before
                            the expiration of their contracts and had then promptly reappeared for
                            recruitment in this capital for return to the United States for further
                            employment under the agricultural agreement. The Department <pb n="583"
                                xml:id="pg_583" facs="0597"/>directed the Embassy to bring this
                            matter to the attention of the Foreign Office here and also to arrive at
                            an understanding that Mexican nationals, who have been granted leaves of
                            absence to visit their families in Mexico, might return to the United
                            States to complete their contracts without any charges being imposed by
                            the Mexican Government for their re-entry.</p>
                        <p>As of December 1, the Embassy brought the above to the attention of Señor
                            Manuel Tello, Oficial Mayor of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Señor
                            Tello expressed himself as being in accord with the arrangements made
                            whereby Mexican workers were granted leave of absence without pay and
                            for their return to the United States. Señor Tello was informed orally
                            as to the charges being made by Mexican immigration officials at border
                            ports of entry and he said that he would look into this phase of the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has been shown a copy of instructions which have been issued
                            to Mexican workers, agricultural and non-agricultural, in the United
                            States by the representatives there of the Mexican Ministry of Labor.
                            These instructions point out the increasing number of repatriations
                            being demanded by the workers on flimsy excuses and states that these
                            cannot be tolerated; that in the future workers who desire to be
                            repatriated before the termination of their contracts may be so
                            repatriated only on the most urgent personal family matters, such as
                            illness or death and that such illness or death must be attested by a
                            reputable physician in the home district of the worker and certified to
                            by the competent Mexican civil authority. It is hoped that with the
                            strict enforcement of these instructions the number of repatriations of
                            which the War Food Administration is concerned will be considerably
                            decreased.</p>

                            a telegram to Mexican officials. The telegram protested that Mexican
                            workers brought into this country under existing agreements were by the
                            terms of those agreements prevented from becoming members of labor
                            organizations and that they were therefore being discriminated
                            against.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>You will be interested in knowing that since that conversation between
                            Mr. O’Donoghue and an officer of the Department this matter has been
                            discussed with both the War Manpower Commission and the War Food
                            Administration, both of which share the Department’s opinion that there
                            is nothing in the agreements which would prevent Mexican workers from
                            joining unions if they so wished. Colonel Philip G. Bruton, Deputy
                            Administrator of the War Food Administration in charge of labor matters,
                            telephoned Mr. William G. Anglim at San Francisco, in charge of the
                            field administration of Mexican agricultural workers, who confirmed that
                            in field practice the War Food Administration had been neutral in regard
                            to this question. Mr. Anglim further stated that it was his
                            understanding that the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of
                            Industrial Organizations had been interested at the time of the
                            negotiation of these agreements that there would be no displacement of
                            American laborers by workers brought in from Mexico, and that Section 4
                            of the General Provisions reflected this interest. It may be further
                            stated that at the time the agreements were negotiated, the Mexican
                            Government, because of the temporary nature of the migration, had
                            reservations about Mexican workers being involved with American unions
                            and that the American unions apparently shared these reservations.</p>

                            commission composed of two representatives of the Mexican Government,
                                <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0599"/>and two representatives of
                            the Government of the United States, to consider problems raised in
                            relation to the Mexican railroad workers employed in the United States
                            under the agreement of April 29, 1943.</p>
                        <p>I now have the honor to inform the Department that in a note dated
                            December 16, 1943 the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has informed the
                            Embassy that the Mexican representatives on the commission will be Lie.
                            Luis Padilla Nervo, the Oficial Mayor of the Ministry of Labor, and Mr.
                            Manuel Aguilar, a Mexican Consul assigned to the Consulate General in
                            Los Angeles.<note n="90" xml:id="d491fn90">The American members were
                                Judge Charles M. Hay, General Counsel of the War Manpower
                                Commission, and William G. MacLean of the Department of
                                State.</note></p>
                        <p>The Ministry added that the Mexican commissioners will be glad to join
                            the United States commissioners in El Paso, Texas on January 17, 1944.
                            It is presumed by the Embassy that the Mexican representatives can be
                            located through the Mexican Consulate General in El Paso.</p>

                        <p>It is stated in the Embassy’s memorandum under reference that, with a
                            view to concluding a final arrangement with respect to the matter, the
                            Mexican Government “might agree to release the petroleum companies from
                            the obligations which the Zevada–Cooke award left against them” if the
                            Government of the United States would be prepared to regard as included
                            in the settlement claims with respect to the properties of certain
                            companies not named in the Expropriation Decree of March 18, 1938 or in
                            the joint report of Messrs. Cooke and Zevada. However, it is also stated
                            that the proposed release would be applicable only with respect to such
                            of the above-mentioned claims against the companies as are under the
                            “exclusive” jurisdiction of the courts of Mexico.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that some, if not all, of the claims in question may
                            not be regarded as subject to the “exclusive” jurisdiction of the courts
                            of Mexico the proposed arrangement would appear to leave the companies
                            subject to suit in the courts of the United States on account of such
                            claims.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, in order that the Department of State and the interested
                            companies may be in a position to consider the proposals of the
                            Government of Mexico with full understanding of their purport, the
                            Department of State would greatly appreciate receiving a more
                            comprehensive statement of the position of the Mexican Government in
                            relation to the scope of the proposed release.</p>

                        <p>The Government of Mexico has given most attentive consideration to the
                            Memorandum of February 16, 1943 submitted by the Department of State of
                            the United States of America in connection with the arrangement—under
                            negotiation—intended to determine the interpretation <pb n="587"
                                xml:id="pg_587" facs="0601"/>and the scope of the valuation which
                            fixed the compensation due to the United States nationals whose
                            properties, rights and interests in the petroleum industry in the
                            Republic were affected by acts of the Mexican Government subsequent to
                            March 17, 1938.</p>
                        <p>With the purpose of obtaining a definitive solution of this matter, in
                            the broadest spirit of collaboration, the Government of Mexico desires
                            to define its attitude by means of the examination of the antecedents
                            which it summarizes below:</p>
                                <p>1. According to the engagement contracted in the notes which were
                                    exchanged at Washington, November 19, 1941<note n="96"
                                        xml:id="d493fn96">For texts of notes, see Department of
                                        State Executive Agreement Series No. 234, or 55 Stat. (pt.
                                        2) 1554.</note> the International Commission of Experts was
                                    formed for the purpose of fixing a just compensation for the
                                    United States nationals affected by the petroleum expropriation.
                                    The said Commission was empowered, by paragraph 10 of the
                                    agreement mentioned, to render a joint opinion in which it
                                    should fix precisely the indemnities which it might consider
                                    proper and recommend the manner and terms of payment thereof.
                                    Furthermore, it will be recalled that—in accordance with
                                    paragraphs 12 and 16 of the same notes—it was determined that
                                    the joint opinion would be not subject to appeal and the
                                    compensation and interest fixed by the experts would be of a
                                    final character; leaving to the Chancelries only the final
                                    decision concerning the form and terms of the payment.</p>
                                <p>2. On April 17, 1942 the Commission of Experts submitted to
                                        the Governments of Mexico and the United States of America a
                                        joint opinion resulting from the agreement of the experts.
                                        This opinion concludes with five proposals, of which the
                                        fourth makes a recommendation while the others are expressed
                                        in clearly conclusive form.</p>
                                    <p>Everything seemed to indicate that, with the settlement and
                                        the scale of payments which the Government of Mexico
                                        submitted to the Department of State on June 30 and July 25,
                                            1942,<note n="97" xml:id="d493fn97">Not printed.</note>
                                        the case should be deemed to be settled.</p>
                                <p>3. Nevertheless, the Department of State thought that the
                                        conclusions of the joint expert opinion were susceptible of
                                        interpretation and, in its Memorandum of September 9,
                                            1942<note n="97" xml:id="d493fn98">Not printed.</note>
                                        it characterized as recommendations the second and third
                                        conclusions of the above-mentioned decision. In its
                                        judgment, the experts recommended: <list>

                                        Government of Mexico was called to the fact that six
                                        companies whose properties had been affected by acts of
                                        expropriation had not been listed in the experts’ opinion
                                        and that, of these, the Compañía Petrólera Titania S.A. and
                                        the Compañía de Petróleo Mercedes, S.A. had obtained a
                                        decision of the Mexican Supreme Court of Justice which
                                        implied the return of their properties and rights.</p>
                                    <p>Finally, with the purpose of reaching a definitive solution,
                                        the Government of the United States proposed to conclude an
                                        agreement along the following lines: <list>

                                                the same Government in the course of the formal and
                                                informal conversations that were held in the

                                                additional concessions and giving them facilities
                                                for the resumption and increase of their

                                <p>4. The Mexican Chancelry replied to the foregoing proposal in
                                        its Memorandum of November 17, 1942.<note n="99"

                                        the first place, the sixth point, regarding the Titania and
                                        Mercedes Companies, as being completely foreign to the
                                        negotiations for the purpose of giving execution and
                                        practical application to the opinion of the experts, Messrs.
                                        Zevada and Cooke. Next, it referred to the manner of the
                                        payment of the indemnity and interest fixed by the experts,
                                        stating that for it properly to be perfected, the agreement
                                        already reached by both Governments only needed to be set
                                        forth formally. Lastly it emphasized <pb n="589"

                                        modifying the experts’ opinion so far as concerns: <list>

                                    <p>As a basis for its attitude on this last point, the
                                        Government of Mexico indicated that the experts, Messrs.
                                        Zevada and Cooke, when they fixed the indemnity, had in view
                                        the existence of certain liabilities against the companies
                                        and that, consequently, if the latter were subsequently
                                        released from those obligations, the indemnity would be
                                        increased by the amount of such charges in violation of the
                                        Agreement constituting the expert arbitration, which
                                        prescribed that the compensation fixed by the experts
                                        jointly could not be changed. So far as concerns the
                                        companies which were apparently omitted, it was pointed out
                                        that, unless it was shown that the experts failed to comply
                                        with the obligations which the Agreement of November 19,
                                        1941 imposed on them, it was evident that all properties of
                                        which they had knowledge—including those of the companies
                                        which were not listed as appears from the detailed inventory
                                        which served as a basis for the valuation—were taken into
                                        account when the indemnity was determined and were covered
                                        by it.</p>
                                    <p>In spite of the legal strength of the arguments invoked by
                                        its Chancelry, the Government of Mexico, in view of the
                                        attitude of beneficent compromise and friendly reciprocity
                                        which has characterized all the negotiations and agreements
                                        for the purpose of putting an end to this matter, made the
                                        counter-proposal that: If the Government of the United
                                        States of America agreed to consider as included in the
                                        expert opinion the six companies not listed (including the
                                        Titania and the Mercedes), it would agree in turn to waive
                                        the obligations of the petroleum companies which the
                                        Zevada–Cooke opinion left against them; and it made clear
                                        that there would only be understood as included in the
                                        waiver the claims which were within the exclusive
                                        jurisdiction of the Mexican courts and not those suits which
                                        had been submitted or might be submitted in the future to
                                        foreign courts.</p>
                                <p>5. Now, in the last Memorandum of the Department of State, dated
                                    February 16 of the current year, the Government of the United
                                    States of America expresses its desire “to receive a more
                                    detailed exposition of the attitude of the Mexican Government in
                                    relation to the scope of the proposed waiver of
                                    obligations”.</p>
                        <p>Acceding to the request of the Department of State, the Government of
                            Mexico sets forth the following in detail: In exchange for considering
                            the firms Cía. Petrolera Titania, S. A.; Cía. de Petróleos Mercedes,
                            S.A.; J. A. Brown, S. en C; Green y Cía., Doheny, Bridge <pb n="590"

                            their demands and claims being covered by the indemnity and interest
                            indicated in the same opinion, the petroleum companies affected by the
                            acts of expropriation to which these negotiations refer shall be deemed
                            to be liberated from: <list>

                        <p>In virtue of the principle of immunity, universally accepted in
                            international law, the Government of Mexico is not disposed to subject
                            itself to the decisions of foreign courts. Consequently, it finds it
                            impossible to assume the obligation of answering for the suits brought,
                            or which in the future may be brought, in United States courts against
                            the expropriated petroleum companies.</p>

                            <p>As will be clearly seen from reading all the foregoing, the attitude
                                of the Government of Mexico is most strictly within the spirit and
                                letter of the engagements entered into November 19, 1941. In
                                agreeing to the modification, in the terms of section 5 of this
                                Memorandum, of the third decision of the joint expert opinion of
                                April 17, 1942 (which, from its expressions and purposes, is
                                conclusive and unappealable) the Government of Mexico does so with
                                the purpose of settling discrepancies and concluding this matter on
                                the basis of cordial understanding on which it has been discussed by
                                the two Chancelries.</p>
                            <p>Being convinced that the American authorities are animated by the
                                same friendly disposition, the Government of Mexico makes bold to
                                hope that the reasoning set forth in this Memorandum will receive
                                from them all the attention it merits and that a conclusion of the
                                negotiations initiated November 19, 1941 may soon be achieved.</p>

                            petroleum properties in Mexico in which certain American companies were

                        <p>In the joint report evaluating the companies’ claims at approximately
                            $24,000,000, Messrs. Cooke and Zevada recommended (<hi rend="italic"

                            release each other of all pending claims, except certain alleged claims
                            of the Government against the companies and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                            that the companies remain responsible for private claims then pending
                            against them in the Mexican courts.</p>
                        <p>Attempts made by the Department to obtain information regarding the
                            probable total amount of such claims have proven futile. It and the
                            companies have been apprehensive that such claims might be determined by
                            Mexican judicial or administrative authorities to be valid in amounts
                            possibly equaling or exceeding the $24,000,000 which Cooke and Zevada
                            found to be due the companies. However, the Mexican Government has
                            finally expressed its willingness (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) to regard
                            as cancelled the alleged claims of the Government against the companies
                            and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) to relieve the companies of
                            responsibility with respect to any private claims against them which may
                            be determined as valid claims by the Mexican courts. It is not willing
                            to assume responsibility for private claims against the companies which
                            may be prosecuted in American courts.</p>

                        <p>The above-mentioned proposal of the Mexican Government is conditioned on
                            our agreement that there be included in the $24,000,000 settlement the
                            claims of the Titania and Mercedes Companies (subsidiaries of Standard
                            Oil of New Jersey) whose properties have been evaluated by Messrs. Cooke
                            and Zevada and included in their total appraisal. Subsequently, the
                            Supreme Court of Mexico held that the properties of those Companies had
                            not been expropriated and at the request of Standard the Department has
                            been endeavoring to induce the Mexican Government to return these
                            extensive but undeveloped properties to the Companies, thus giving
                            effect to the decision of the Mexican Supreme Court. However, shortly
                            prior to the receipt of the recent Mexican note, in which it is insisted
                            that the properties be included in the general settlement, an official
                            of Standard indicated orally to an official of the Department that the
                            Company was apparently willing to forego its claim to those properties
                            if such action on its part would tend to facilitate a final settlement
                            of the claims arising out of the expropriations.</p>

                            should be accepted, thus effecting a final settlement of the claims
                            growing out of the expropriations of 1938. It is their belief that most,
                            and possibly all, of the companies will go along with the settlement
                            made on the proposed basis. It is also believed that a settlement of
                            these claims will greatly facilitate negotiations in relation to the

                        <p>160. From Duggan. I refer to your letter of January 19, 1943, in which
                            you submitted a draft reply to the Mexican memorandum of December 31,
                                1942<note n="6" xml:id="d495fn6">None printed. The Mexican
                                memorandum of December 31, 1942, indicated the Mexican expectation
                                that conversations on the water problem would proceed on a
                                percentage of distribution basis, that new proposals would be
                                forthcoming from the Department of State, and that the negotiations
                                would be transferred to Mexico City (711.1216M/2242).</note>
                            relative to your recent informal conversations regarding the water
                            problem.</p>
                        <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0607"/>
                        <p>Because of, first, apparent tendency in Foreign Office to construe as
                            formal negotiations your personal, informal talks; second, increasingly
                            delicate situation in Basin created by recent upsurge of rumors and
                            suspicions; third, probably disastrous effect upon present efforts if
                            idea spreads that negotiations are being transferred to Mexico City;
                            and, fourth, the necessity of making additional technical studies in the
                            field, it is believed advisable to suggest that your next conversations
                            await a more opportune moment. The further fact that intensive studies
                            here and in El Paso are being conducted in closest possible
                            collaboration with the Committee makes it impracticable to transfer the
                            initiative to Mexico City. This suggests desirability of changing your
                            third paragraph and also affords satisfactory explanation.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the fourth and fifth paragraphs of the Mexican
                            memorandum it would appear desirable to suggest in your reply that when
                            the two Governments begin formal negotiations an arrangement entirely
                            satisfactory to the Mexican Government can no doubt be reached as to the
                            seat of the “final conversations.” We understand that this quoted phrase
                            refers only to the formalities of signature once the two Governments
                            have agreed upon the text of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>Your proposed fifth paragraph is in conformity with suggestions already
                            made to the Mexican Ambassador<note n="7" xml:id="d495fn7">Francisco
                                Castillo Nájera.</note> and to Fernández Mac-Gregor.<note n="8"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Larry</hi>: A few days ago when I was at the
                            Foreign Office, just as I was leaving Torres Bodet’s<note n="9"
                                xml:id="d496fn9">Jaime Torres Bodet, Mexican Under Secretary for
                                Foreign Affairs.</note> office after talking to him about other
                            matters, he brought up the question of the distribution of the waters of
                            the Colorado River again, emphasizing in a number of ways the keen
                            interest of the Mexican Government in a prompt solution. He said that it
                            was really imperative for the Mexican Government to have a solution.</p>
                        <p>What I consider the most important point raised by Torres Bodet—although
                            it was not the first point in the conversation—was that the <pb n="594"
                                xml:id="pg_594" facs="0608"/>Mexican Government, while it would be
                            very reluctant to do so, had decided that in the event it could not
                            reach a solution as between governments, it would have to ask us to
                            submit the question to arbitration. He said that he realized this would
                            be a very difficult and unfortunate step to take, given the excellent
                            relations between the two countries and the fact that they had been able
                            recently to work out so many problems. He said it would not look well
                            for the Mexican Government to resort to this step. He also stated that
                            the questions such as claims which had been settled were really
                            transitory and not fundamental, and that accordingly the water question
                            was far more important. He suggested that a solution would really cement
                            good relations, and in this connection I understood him to say that it
                            would not be prudent for the Mexican Government to do anything about
                                Chamizal<note n="10" xml:id="d496fn10">A tract of some 600 acres at

                            this information in a discreet way in talking to the representatives of
                            the Colorado River Basin States. It might, however, make something of an
                            impression on them.</p>
                        <p>Torres Bodet asked me whether it would help us were the Mexican
                            Government to bring up this matter in a written communication, and I
                            told him I thought it would be better for the present not to present
                            this suggestion of a possible demand for arbitration to us in any formal
                            way.</p>
                        <p>I told Torres Bodet that I had been in correspondence with you regarding
                            our reply to the informal memorandum handed to Ambassador Messersmith by
                            Señor Padilla some time ago,<note n="11" xml:id="d496fn11">Ezequiel
                                Padilla, Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs. Presumably reference
                                is to memorandum of December 31, 1942, not printed.</note> and that
                            I thought our reply would be forthcoming very soon.</p>
                        <p>He asked me whether the Ambassador was discussing the water problem in
                            Washington and I said that I doubted that he was dealing with any of the
                            technical aspects, but no doubt he was discussing with the appropriate
                            officials in Washington the well-understood desire of the Mexican
                            Government to have the question solved.</p>
                        <p>I took advantage of this opportunity to say that the Department was
                            awaiting the Foreign Office’s reply to the Department’s memorandum of
                            November 4, 1942;<note n="12" xml:id="d496fn12"><ref

                                    561</ref>.</note> in this connection I said that it had been my
                            understanding that in requesting Ambassador Messersmith to have me
                            engage in informal conversations with officials of the Ministry on the
                            water problem, it had been the desire of the Foreign Minister that I
                            cooperate with these officials in the formulation of a <pb n="595"
                                xml:id="pg_595" facs="0609"/>reply with a view to mutual
                            understanding. Torres Bodet said that his understanding of the motives
                            behind the Minister’s request was that the Minister desired to
                            accomplish two objectives: namely, to expedite negotiations and
                            particularly to try to avoid exchanges of polemics on the subject. (It
                            seems to me that this is a rather revealing statement and explains the
                            subsequent action of the Foreign Office in endeavoring to precipitate
                            matters much more than had been the Department’s intention or mine. If
                            the Ambassador is still available, I wish you would be good enough to
                            check with him as to the Minister’s explanation of why he wanted this
                            Embassy to have informal collateral talks to supplement the activities
                            going on concurrently in Washington.)</p>
                        <p>I also said to Torres Bodet that I imagined our reply to Padilla’s
                            informal memorandum would probably indicate a willingness on our part to
                            have the eventual water treaty signed in Mexico City, but that I thought
                            the Department, because of the greater accessibility of data and its
                            missionary work with the Committee of Sixteen,<note n="12a"
                                xml:id="d496fn12a">Committee composed of two representatives of each

                            negotiations remain in the United States as at present. Torres Bodet
                            said that he thought it would be helpful to Mexico were the treaty
                            signed here, but he appeared to be convinced that some of the
                            negotiations could take place in Mexico City, although he did indicate
                            that it might possibly be a good idea to take no further action until
                            the Ambassador returns here.</p>

                            <p>P/s—In reading over the third paragraph to begin on page 2, I find
                                that I have not made as clear as I had intended the distinction
                                between what I had understood to be Padilla’s desire, and the
                                Minister’s desire as explained by Torres Bodet. The distinction is
                                this: It was my understanding that a reply would go forward to our
                                memorandum of November 4, but that it was thought advisable to have
                                me go over the Mexican reply with officials of the Foreign Office
                                before it was in final form; as I understood the statement of Torres
                                Bodet, it was to the effect that the Minister thought a lot could be
                                accomplished orally without the necessity for further written
                                exchanges. I think the Ambassador understood that the conferences
                                were primarily with a view to having the reply to the memorandum of
                                November 4 as satisfactory as possible to us, or at least to explore
                                the possibility of having it as satisfactory as possible. If it is
                                the case that the Minister did not explain accurately to the
                                Ambassador his, the Minister’s, desires in the matter, this would
                                seem to be the whole nub of the misunderstanding which seems to have
                                developed. However, by dwelling on this point I do not mean to
                                suggest that any harm has been done or that the Embassy is in a
                                position from which it cannot withdraw. HSB.</p>

                        <p>The Government of Mexico has given most careful attention to the
                            Memorandum of the Department of State dated November 4, 1942<note n="17"

                            the waters of the Colorado River.</p>
                        <p>Before commenting in detail concerning each of the points contained in
                            the Memorandum under reference it is pertinent to analyze certain
                            fundamental discrepancies which may perhaps explain the little progress
                            made to date in the negotiation of a water Treaty between Mexico and the
                            United States of America.</p>
                        <p>At the outset the Government of Mexico reiterates its stand of dealing
                            uniformly with the problems arising from the utilization of the waters
                            of the Bravo<note n="18" xml:id="d498fn18">Mexican name for the Rio
                                Grande River.</note> and Colorado Rivers since, as will hereinafter
                            be made manifest, the application of differing standards to the <pb
                                n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0611"/>two international currents
                            mentioned would lead to inequitable solutions.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it cannot accept that the theory of a supposed right based upon
                            priority of use should become a fundamental rule to decide the problem
                            of distribution of the waters of international rivers, and it also
                            considers inadmissible that the proposal of the United States of America
                            for the delivery of waters of the Colorado River to Mexico should base
                            itself exclusively upon compliance with and protection of Mexican uses
                            prior to the completion of Boulder Dam. The reasons for the foregoing
                            attitude derive from the fact that if in the case of ownerless things or
                            things over which there is no established right, the mere occupation and
                            priority of use thereof can produce the erection of a right over such
                            things, this does not apply as regards those properties concerning which
                            there is a right prior to any occupation or utilization; this latter
                            right implying the faculty, precisely, of using or utilizing the thing
                            as occasion may permit, or at the will of the holder thereof. In the
                            case of the waters of the Colorado and Bravo Rivers Mexico has the right
                            to their use and utilization, derived from existing Treaties between the
                            two countries and from the norms of International Law which regulate the
                            joint relations of neighboring countries with relation to international
                            rivers flowing between them and, therefore, this right is prior,
                            principal and independent in relation to any act, and against it there
                            can prevail neither occupation nor priority of use. Furthermore, the
                            thesis expressed by the Department of State does not appear to be very
                            fair since, if it were applied in the case of the Bravo River it would
                            produce the conclusion that the United States of America shall receive
                            only the waters indispensable to satisfy the needs of utilization in the
                            Brownsville Valley prior to the construction of hydraulic works on the
                            Conchos River;<note n="19" xml:id="d498fn19">A tributary of the Rio
                                Grande River in Chihuahua state, Mexico</note> which, having
                            regularized the principal supply of water flowing in the Lower Bravo
                            River and having supplied the most permanent stream in the dry season,
                            made possible the greater part of present uses in the American region
                            mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, neither can the Government of Mexico admit that the question be
                            reduced exclusively to determining what would be the volume of excess
                            water in the Colorado River after satisfying all present utilizations
                            and all projects for future uses in American territory; so that Mexico
                            would be constrained to receive only the excess volume which would not
                            be utilizable for the United States of America. Application of this
                            principle to the Bravo River situation would result in the conclusion
                            that Mexico would be authorized to utilize all the current of the
                            Mexican tributaries, even to the employment of their waters—especially
                            those of the Conchos—in tappings outside of their <pb n="598"
                                xml:id="pg_598" facs="0612"/>basins; the Lower Bravo users to be
                            content with the volumes which might be left over even though thereby

                            River might be rendered impossible. The Government of Mexico considers
                            that both situations are absolutely unfair and reiterates its opinion
                            that the waters of international rivers must be distributed among the
                            riparian countries in proportion to the areas susceptible to irrigation
                            in equality of hydraulic conditions; in such a manner that if there
                            should be insufficient water to satisfy them all there be mutually
                            eliminated projects which present the same characteristics of high cost
                            and difficulty of realization. It is not clearly seen why, with the
                            object of fixing American needs to the waters of the Colorado, there are
                            considered future projects of costly execution and extractions from the

                            are eliminated not only easier realizations and its urgent needs for the
                            immediate future, but even projects under development and even a certain

                                        territory of the United States of America; therefore the
                                        irrigation of a considerable surface of good land has been
                                        abstained from, susceptible of easy and economic
                                        cultivation, and its pretension has been limited to
                                        2,468,000,000 cubic meters (2,000,000 acre-feet).
                                        Unquestionably, if the irrigable surface, the necessities,
                                        and the absolute right of Mexico should be attended, it
                                        would be necessary to fix a volume much greater than that
                                        mentioned, derived from the irregular and uncontrolled flow
                                        of the Colorado River.</item>

                                    the control and regularization supplied by the American works.
                                    Similarly, due consideration was given to the fact that this

                                    imply insufficiency of the available flow in spite of the
                                    storage systems, Mexico is willing to a reduction of its

                            reporting the receipt of a memorandum from the Foreign Office<note
                                n="26" xml:id="d499fn26">Memorandum of February 16, <hi
                                    rend="italic">supra.</hi></note> regarding the Colorado River
                            matter. I have had a rough translation made of the memorandum and
                            enclose it as a precaution against there being any discrepancy in the
                            drafts delivered to the Department and presented to me,
                            respectively.</p>
                        <p>I have found time to give several readings to the memorandum, but not to
                            study it thoroughly. Therefore all I can say regarding it for the moment
                            is what follows:</p>
                        <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0616"/>
                        <p>There may be no disadvantage in the linking of the Colorado River and the
                            Rio Grande problems in the memorandum, if the linking goes no further.
                            But I should think that even one step more, if it were known, would
                            cause misunderstanding in the Lower Basin of the Colorado. I get the
                            very general impression that the memorandum of February 16th is none too
                            strong technically but that morally it might carry considerable weight
                            in the minds of arbitrators. The Foreign Office seems to have gotten
                            away from the wholly unsound idea of transferring negotiations down
                            here, but it has gone back to the proposal to have the Boundary
                            Commissioner find a solution. Despite all that has been said in Mexico
                            City, El Paso, and Washington, the Foreign Office still does not seem to
                            realize, or be willing to understand, that although the problem has many
                            technical aspects it has some complicated political aspects in the
                            United States which simply cannot be resolved by engineers dealing with
                            engineering data, however competent they may be and however great their
                            good will.</p>
                        <p>I am greatly relieved by the general cordial tone of the Mexican
                            memorandum.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Herb</hi>: Your letters of February 10 and 11,
                            1943 in reference to the Colorado River problem give additional evidence
                            that the Foreign Office attempted, no doubt with the best intentions, to
                            steer the matter along lines that might well have proved disastrous.
                            Needless to say, the Department, no less than the Mexican Foreign
                            Office, is desirous of finding an equitable solution; but before
                            deciding upon a formula we must know pretty definitely what the cost to
                            the United States would be in terms of limitations upon the future of
                            the Colorado River Basin.</p>
                        <p>Torres Bodet’s suggestion that the Mexican Government might ask us to
                            refer the matter to arbitration was not unexpected. This possibility has
                            been discussed more than once with and among members of the Committee of
                            Sixteen. The elaborate arguments presented by the California members to
                            the effect that no arbitral body could properly hold against us afford
                            some cause for suspicion that they really fear the consequences of an
                            arbitral proceeding. On this point you may recall paragraphs, page 27,
                            of the Report of December 23, 1942,<note n="33" xml:id="d501fn33">Report
                                by Charles A. Timm, of the Division of the American Republics (not
                                printed), of meetings with Bureau of Reclamation and International
                                Boundary Commission officials and with a sub-committee of three of
                                the Committee of Sixteen.</note> on the Denver and El Paso meetings.
                            All things considered, it would appear to be highly inadvisable for the
                            Mexican Government to bring up at this juncture the question of
                            arbitration. However, in our discussions with the Committee we shall not
                            fail to keep in mind the possible dangers to us of an arbitral
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>In your letter of February 11 you made an interesting comparison between
                            Federal Project No. 5 and the proposed Mexican heading below the Upper
                            Boundary. I detect what seems to me to be a substantial difference. As
                            was noted in the memorandum of conversation <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606"
                                facs="0620"/>of January 25<note n="34" xml:id="d501fn34">Not
                                printed.</note> (page 4), a cut in the right bank of the Colorado
                            would greatly increase the flood danger in that it would create a
                            situation wherein the river might once more break through to the Salton
                            Sea. You will recall that there is a rapid drop in altitude from the
                            Alamo heading in the river to the Imperial Valley (California). No
                            comparable danger to either country is inherent in Federal Project No.

                        <p>Sometime ago, in a conversation with Mr. Bonsal, I undertook to prepare a
                            memorandum setting forth some of the basic factors of the Colorado River
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>A previous memorandum (November 12, 1942)<note n="38" xml:id="d502fn38"
                                >Not printed.</note> summarized the position taken by the several
                            States of the Colorado River Basin in regard to the proposed water
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>The present memorandum has as its purpose an analysis of the more
                            essential factors that must be considered in drawing up the terms of a
                            treaty. Also it presents some tables<note n="38" xml:id="d502fn39">Not

                            plans of allocation.</p>
                        <p>This memorandum and the accompanying tables have been examined by Mr.
                            Duggan, Commissioner Lawson, Judge Clifford H. Stone, Chairman of the
                            Committee of Sixteen, and Mr. R. J. Tipton, Consulting Engineer of the

                        <p>It has been tentatively agreed that a formula, based upon Table III
                            (1,500,000 a.f. on a base release of 10,000,000 a.f.), will be submitted
                            to the Committee. This proposed formula has these features: <list>

                                    water available in the river up to the requirements of Mexico or
                                    to the full capacity of such canals.</item>

                                    be the subject of conferences during the week of March 8 with

                            is thought that it represents a stage through which the negotiations
                            must go, both with the Committee and with Mexico, assuming it meets with

                                    specified in (1) above. The United States agrees to make

                            Mexico. Under present conditions demand water under Section I would
                            amount to about 450,000 a.f. The additional assured water would be
                            available for Mexico but would not be delivered on demand. This demand
                            water could easily be used to firm up all of the remainder of the

                            and power interests, were represented by approximately 50 people.</p>
                        <p>We presented, on April 14, a proposal in brief guaranteeing (<hi

                            of water equal to 10% of the diversions for that year from the Colorado

                            California and Nevada (this amount is estimated at around 750,000
                            acre-feet, the maximum amount used by Mexico prior to construction of
                            the Boulder Dam, and may, if necessary, be taken from the reservoir),
                            and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the delivery of an additional amount of
                            not less than 750,000 acre-feet in any year from other water arriving
                            and being available at the International Boundary from the river (this
                            water represents that which may be divertible from the surplus water now
                            going to Mexico through <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0623"/>the
                            river channel under ordinary conditions). The proposal stated that the
                            maximum deliveries under (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) and (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) should not exceed 2,000,000 acre-feet in any
                            one year, and that deliveries in excess of the amount specified in (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) and the minimum amount specified in (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) shall be subject to the availability of such
                            excess water at the International Boundary. In other words, the proposal
                            does not contemplate a guarantee of water in excess of approximately
                            1,500,000 acre-feet.</p>
                        <p>It was generally considered that for the time being and for some years to
                            come most, if not all, of the guaranteed 1,500,000 acre-feet referred to
                            in (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) can be
                            taken from the river at the border without interfering with power and
                            irrigation projects in the United States, but that should this prove to
                            be insufficient at any time to meet the needs of Mexico, other water
                            shall be released from the Dam to make up the deficiency, there being
                            certain qualifications with respect to Mexico’s ability beneficially to
                            use the water, and the possibility of extraordinary drought or serious
                            accident to the irrigation system in the United States. There would be a
                            certain amount of so-called “wild water” which Mexico could capture from
                            time to time but we would enter into no undertaking regarding it.</p>
                        <p>The Committee of Sixteen representing the Basin States adopted a
                            resolution approving in principle our proposal and specifying, that it
                            is the consensus of the Committee that the quantity of water required to
                            be delivered shall be treated as a maximum quantity and that the
                            ultimate quantity of water to be delivered under the provisions of any
                            treaty be kept within such limitations. Five States, Arizona, Colorado,
                            New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, voted in favor of the resolution. Nevada,
                            whose representative arrived late and was unable to participate in all
                            the discussions, did not vote. California, and the power and irrigation
                            interests in that State, cast two negative votes, there being a sharp
                            difference of view between the Californians and the representatives of
                            the other States.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the foregoing the Basin States, other than California,
                            presented a “Statement of Policy”<note n="42" xml:id="d504fn42">Not
                                printed.</note> providing that the facilities constructed and to be
                            constructed and used for the delivery of water to Mexico under any
                            treaty should be under the control of and operated by the United States;
                            that the channelization of at least the international section of the
                            Colorado River and the construction of flood control facilities on the
                            Gila River are of paramount importance; and that these matters should be
                            included in the negotiations with Mexico and made a part of any treaty
                            relating to the allocation <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0624"/>of
                            waters of the Colorado between the United States and that country. This,
                            if carried out, would, among other things, result in the taking over by
                            the Federal Government of certain facilities now operated by the
                            California interests. The proposal was strongly opposed by the
                            representatives from California but was approved by the other States.
                            The discussion, in which we took no part, was somewhat heated. The
                            action taken both on the resolution referred to above and on this
                            “Statement of Policy” constitutes the first decisive step taken by the
                            six Basin States against the opposition of California.</p>
                        <p>The California interests are relying upon contracts concluded with the
                            Secretary of the Interior relating to irrigation and power,<note n="43"
                                xml:id="d504fn43">The Secretary of the Interior entered into a

                            been floated. They realize that if a certain amount of water is
                            guaranteed to Mexico, the time may come when they will be required to
                            give up some of the water they are now using or may use under these
                            contracts. They desire that some provision shall be incorporated in the
                            treaty safeguarding the contracts. I told those who spoke to me about
                            the matter that we could make no commitments in that respect but would,
                            of course, consider any statement which they might desire to present.
                            One or two had asked permission to file a statement with the

                                the approach to be made to the Mexican Government, it being the
                                understanding that we shall not, at least in the first instance,
                                offer Mexico the maximum amount which we might eventually be
                                prepared to make available. There are a number of questions to be
                                discussed in connection with the negotiations, such as facilities to
                                be provided for delivery of water to Mexico, protective works in
                                that country to safeguard the Imperial Valley of California, etc.,
                                all of which will involve considerable expenditures of money.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sumner</hi>: Padilla called me to the Foreign
                            Office last evening and when I got there I found a meeting in progress
                            in his office. It broke up shortly after I arrived and Suárez, Garfías,
                            Zevada and General Jara<note n="45" xml:id="d505fn45">Mexican Cabinet
                                officers.</note> were among those who came out. When I got in to
                            Padilla’s office I found Marte Gómez, the Minister of Agriculture, still
                            there.</p>
                        <p>Padilla opened the conversation by saying they had just had a special
                            meeting of various members of the Cabinet and officials of the
                            Government in order to discuss, at the urgent instructions of the
                            President, the question of water for the Mexicali district. He said that
                            in the meeting which had just ended they had gone into the situation as
                            it stood very fully under these instructions of President Avila Camacho
                            and he had asked Marte Gómez to remain for the conversation with me as
                            Marte Gómez was the member of the Cabinet primarily interested and
                            responsible.</p>
                        <p>He then went on to say that in the district of Mexicali there are some
                            36,000 hectares of cultivated land which are almost entirely dependent
                            upon waters from the United States for the irrigation system, the
                            unusually dry season in both that region of the United States and Mexico
                            had aggravated the water situation and that the people living on these
                            36,000 hectares and their crops were in <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi>
                            danger of catastrophy.</p>
                        <p>In order to meet this situation the Mexican Government had entered into
                            an arrangement with the Imperial Valley Irrigation District for supply
                            of some urgently needed water for which Mexico would pay at the rate of
                            25 cents an acre foot. It now appeared that difficulties had developed
                            about the delivery of this water and in view of the urgency of the
                            matter the Mexican Government had sent several people up to Washington
                            to talk over the matter, I believe with the Department of the Interior.
                            Apparently grave obstacles had arisen so that the Foreign Office here
                            urgently instructed the Mexican Embassy in Washington to take up the
                            matter with the Department of State and Padilla said that Colina<note
                                n="46" xml:id="d505fn46">Rafael de la Colina, Mexican Minister
                                Counselor.</note> had been in the Department twice to talk with us
                            but he was not able to say with whom. The replies which Colina got,
                            Padilla said, were not very encouraging.</p>
                        <p>In view of the really disastrous situation which was arising in the <pb
                                n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0626"/>Mexicali district the President
                            had called some of them in for a meeting yesterday morning and
                            instructed them to have a Cabinet meeting in the afternoon. This meeting
                            had just terminated and it was the unanimous opinion of those present
                            that the situation was serious from many points of view and that I
                            should be asked to come in so that I could take up the matter with you.
                            It seems that yesterday morning the President indicated to Marte Gómez
                            that he considered the situation in Mexicali of sufficient importance to
                            take it up directly himself with President Roosevelt, in view of the
                            fact that a disaster in the Mexicali district could have such
                            unfavorable repercussions on the policies both Presidents were trying to
                            follow.</p>
                        <p>I think the Cabinet meeting last evening was held on [<hi rend="italic"
                                >in</hi>] order to see if such direct intervention by President
                            Avila Camacho with President Roosevelt could not be avoided.</p>
                        <p>Padilla and Marte Gómez said that they did not like this arrangement with
                            the Imperial Valley Irrigation District any more than perhaps some of us
                            did. They were obliged to enter into this agreement because of the
                            urgent necessities of the case and to pay an exorbitant sum for the
                            water and in entering into this agreement with the Imperial Valley
                            Irrigation District the Mexican Government did not intend in any way to
                            create a precedent. They were acting only under immediate and urgent
                            necessity. They said that if there were a water agreement so ardently to
                            be hoped for they should be getting this water for nothing.</p>
                        <p>Padilla asked me to get in touch with you immediately and impress upon
                            you the really urgent and immediate importance of this matter, for if
                            there is no water in the immediate future all the crops in this district
                            will be ruined and he and Marte Gómez emphasized the unfavorable
                            impression the ruin of these people and their crops would have in Mexico
                            and how much more difficult it would make the policies which they are
                            following with us.</p>
                        <p>After Marte Gómez left the room Padilla told me that he had particularly
                            wanted Marte Gómez there, as had the President, as it was necessary that
                            Marte Gómez know that he, Padilla, and the Ministry were making all
                            possible efforts to get this water immediately. As you know, Padilla is
                            criticized a good deal by some of these Ministers, and quite improperly,
                            and the President knows this also.</p>
                        <p>There is no doubt as to the importance of this matter and as the
                            arrangements which the Mexicans have made with the Imperial Valley
                            Irrigation District are not to be considered a precedent and are only
                            caused by dire necessity there is in my mind no doubt that we should
                            make possible the delivery of this water this season. I can assure you
                            that they were not staging a show for me but that this matter is a
                            serious one for the Government here, as well as for the Mexicali <pb
                                n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0627"/>area. The fact that President
                            Avila Camacho considered taking up the matter directly with President
                            Roosevelt gives you, I think, sufficient indication as to the importance
                            the President lays on the matter here.</p>
                        <p>I gave the substance of the foregoing to Larry Duggan over the telephone
                            a few moments ago, who said he would immediately go into the matter and
                            try to have some word for me today. I have, however, wished to give you
                            this more full information in view of the fact that it is likely that it
                            may be difficult to arrange this matter, but I feel that in some way it
                            must be arranged and without delay. The important thing is that the
                            Mexican Government has clearly stated that it considers no precedent of
                            any kind is involved but that they are acting under dire necessity.</p>
                        <p>With all good wishes,</p>
                        <p>Cordially and faithfully yours,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Larry</hi>: I have to refer to my letter of May
                                13<note n="47" xml:id="d506fn47">Not printed.</note> with which I
                            sent you a copy of my letter of the same date to Mr. Welles<note n="48"

                            to the water problem in the Mexicali district.</p>
                        <p>I also have to refer to a conversation which I had with you last evening
                            on the telephone and to a previous conversation on this matter which I
                            had with Joe McGurk this morning when he called me on another
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>I called on Dr. Padilla and Dr. Torres Bodet early this morning and
                            conveyed to them the substance of our conversation over the telephone
                            last evening and that contained in your telegram of May 14<note n="47"
                                xml:id="d506fn49">Not printed.</note> on this matter, just
                            received.</p>
                        <p>I said that the information which you had in the Department was that some
                            2,700 second feet were passing Rockwood Heading<note n="49"
                                xml:id="d506fn50">Rockwood Gate on the Colorado River at Andrade.
                                This quantity of water was larger than at any time for some
                                weeks.</note> to Mexico these days. …</p>
                        <p>I told them that De la Colina was to see you today when you could give
                            him a more full picture of the situation than I could and he would
                            undoubtedly advise them.</p>
                        <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0628"/>
                        <p>I told them that Lawson too had instructions to get in touch with
                            MacGregor and Torres Bodet said that he would immediately get in touch
                            with MacGregor so that he would be sure to see Lawson.</p>
                        <p>I gather that one of the problems is that they have put more ground under
                            cultivation in the Mexicali area and that the 2,700 second feet may not
                            be enough and that they made this emergency arrangement with the
                            Imperial Valley people for this additional water—not liking it any more
                            than we do. Torres Bodet said that a principal pre-occupation of the
                            Mexican Government and of the President was that this program of more
                            intensive cultivation in the Mexicali area which the Government had
                            fostered should be impeded through lack of water and that there should
                            not be unfavorable publicity at this time which could affect our
                            relationships developing in so happy a way. In other words I think that
                            an additional amount other than the 2,700 second feet is involved.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that the conversations which you will have with De la Colina
                            will help to clarify the situation so far as what they are thinking here
                            is concerned. I am sure also that the conversations between MacGregor
                            and Lawson will give you more data on which to work.</p>
                        <p>In some way or other I think we must see that they get the water they
                            need because I am sure that the matter is viewed here seriously or the
                            President would not have taken up the matter here in the way that he
                            did.</p>
                        <p>I am not saying anything more for the present here until I hear from you.
                            Appreciating very much the consideration which you are giving the matter
                            when I know there is so much on your hands.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear George</hi>: I appreciate your personal letter
                            to me of May 13 with regard to the conversation you had with Padilla
                            concerning the rumored shortage of water in the Mexicali District.</p>
                        <p>I understand that as a result of your telephone call to Duggan the Bureau
                            of Reclamation engineer at Yuma, Arizona, made an inspection and
                            reported that more water was passing through the Rockwood Heading and
                            into the Alamo Canal<note n="51" xml:id="d507fn51">The Canal ran from
                                Rockwood Heading to the upper boundary, then down through the
                                Mexicali Valley and back to the boundary some 80 miles west of Yuma.
                                Mexico was entitled to 50% of the flow through the Canal.</note>

                            by telephone to you and, at your request, was also passed on to de la
                            Colina here. Since that time you have received the Department’s telegram
                            of May 14<note n="52" xml:id="d507fn52">No. 773, not printed.</note>
                            giving additional information from Mr. Lawson.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>It is our determination, shared by the Department of the Interior, that
                            the water shall be delivered to Mexico without handling charges and that
                            the only way this can be done is for the United States Government to
                            own, control, and manage the facilities.</p>
                        <p>If this type of scare tactic is tried again I suggest that you delicately
                            recommend to the Mexican authorities that first of all they check with
                            their own people along the border to ascertain the true facts. Had they
                            done so in the present case they would have found that there was no
                            shortage of water. Mr. Lawson assures us that Señor MacGregor, the
                            Mexican Commissioner, is fully apprized of the exact facts, as must be
                            the Mexican irrigation representative in the Mexicali Valley.</p>

                        <p>2. Although I have kept Commissioner Fernández MacGregor advised
                            regarding current diversions at Rckwood Heading, as reported by our
                            field engineer at Calexico, I do not know what he may have reported to
                            the Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>3. As explained in the fourth paragraph of my letter to the Secretary of

                            <hi rend="italic">a copy of which was sent directly to you</hi> it seems
                            probable that it will not be possible to divert sufficient water at the
                            Rockwood Heading intake to meet anticipated peak demands of between
                            3,500 and 4,000 s. f. during July and August, unless a temporary
                            diversion dam is placed in the river at that point. The water which
                            would be thus diverted would, of course, consist entirely of surplus
                            flow in so far as concerns required present uses in the United

                                <item>If the Mexican figure of 1,700,000 acre feet is an irreducible
                                    minimum, the prospects of an agreement may be poor. On the other
                                    hand, if it is a bargaining figure, it may not be too difficult
                                    to bridge the gap between that figure and Mr. Lawson’s tentative
                                    suggestion of 1,250,000; that is, the average of the two
                                    approximates the ultimate minimum of the Department’s Santa Fe

                                <item>Commissioner Lawson has, of course, not yet exhausted the
                                    possibilities of “sweetening up” the offers of water. If the
                                    Mexican figure can not be reduced otherwise, it may be advisable
                                    to give still more attractive financial inducements rather than
                                    go back to the Committee and ask for a new and higher limit on
                                    the quantity of water. There is, for example, the possibility of
                                    assistance in the development of Mexico’s entire irrigation
                                    program, thus not limiting the assistance to Baja California. It
                                    should be borne in mind that the Basin States would, in all
                                    probability, rather see the United States pay a large amount of
                                    money than allot to Mexico a quantity of water that would almost
                                    certainly have a markedly injurious effect upon the future

                        <p>Mr. Lawson’s report regarding diversion into the Alamo Canal is quite
                            encouraging in view of the fears heretofore expressed that it might be
                            impossible to get enough water through Rockwood Heading to supply the
                            peak Mexican demand. Recent conversations with officials of the Bureau
                            of Reclamation indicate that unless power production at Boulder is
                            deliberately curtailed, in view of the water supply situation, the
                            releases for power production will hardly fall below 16,000 c.f.s.,<note
                                n="61" xml:id="d510fn61">Cubic feet per second.</note> thus insuring
                            a relatively high river flow this summer below Yuma. Apparently,
                            therefore, the Department need not fear that Mexican peak demands can
                            not, for the most part, be met during this growing season. Power
                            releases are now running from 19,000 to 20,000 c.f.s.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Herb</hi>: As you suggested in your letter of
                            July 12,<note n="62" xml:id="d511fn62">Not printed.</note> there is some
                            reason to hope that progress is being made in the Colorado River <pb
                                n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0632"/>negotiations. However, as will
                            be noted below, not all the news is good.</p>
                        <p>The Mexican memorandum of July 1<note n="63" xml:id="d511fn63">Not
                                printed.</note> did not indicate any reduction in the Mexican demand
                            for water. However, Fernández MacGregor has apparently been authorized
                            to discuss figures below 2,000,000 acre feet. As I understand the
                            present situation, the two Governments are not directly to undertake to
                            reach an agreement concerning the amount of water but have authorized
                            the two Commissioners to make recommendations, the expectation being
                            that if they can agree on some amount, the concurrence of the two
                            Governments will be highly probable.</p>
                        <p>The latest reports from El Paso indicate that there is still a wide gap
                            between the positions of the two Commissioners. If we could feel
                            justified in giving as much as 1,700,000 acre feet, it is probable that
                            rapid progress could be made. However, it is difficult to see how, as
                            matters stand, we can go above the Santa Fe formula, which envisages an
                            ultimate guarantee of approximately 1,500,000 acre feet to Mexico per
                            year. The Basin States went a long way when they approved a formula that
                            virtually doubled the Committee’s formula of June 1942.</p>
                        <p>It is to be hoped that our Mexican friends will not conclude that Mexico
                            has more to gain through arbitration than through negotiations. In some
                            respects arbitration may offer some alluring prospects to Mexico, but a
                            realistic appraisal of the situation should make them beware of that
                            method.</p>
                        <p>The best news today is that diversions through Rockwood Heading have
                            reached approximately 3,500 c.f.s. This is due partly to continued high
                            river flow but more to improvement in operations at the Heading. This
                            provides its own commentary on the late April-early May flurry about
                            diversions.</p>
                        <p>We shall keep you informed. As you suggest, and especially in view of the
                            broad discretion that each Government has given to its Boundary
                            Commissioner, it would appear inadvisable to encourage discussions in
                            Mexico City or, for that matter, with the Mexican Embassy here.</p>

                            possible to adjust by diplomacy and which are juridical in their nature
                            by reason of being susceptible of decision by the application of the
                            principles of law.</p>
                        <p>I agree with Mr. Lawson that there is at present no question to
                            arbitrate.</p>
                        <p>I say this for the reason that we have offered to negotiate a treaty
                            allocating to Mexico a fair share of water, even more than Mexico was
                            using or would have been able to use with the river in a state of
                            nature, and there is not now any reason to suppose that the matter
                            cannot be adjusted by diplomacy if Mexico takes a reasonable attitude.
                            Should these negotiations prove abortive because Mexico claims more
                            water than we are willing to make available, she might then say that
                            there exist differences of an international character by virtue of a
                            claim of right which it has not been possible to adjust by diplomacy;
                            that those differences are juridical in their nature since they are
                            susceptible of decision by the application of principles of law, and
                            demand arbitration. While the principles of law in this particular field
                            are somewhat vague and nebulous, we probably would not feel disposed to
                            decline arbitration. I should not in that event greatly fear
                            arbitration, although we can never be certain how an arbitral tribunal
                            may react to a given state of facts, for the following reasons: <list>

                        <p>The attached memoranda<note n="66" xml:id="d513fn66">Not printed.</note>
                            regarding the oil seeds projects illustrate some of the difficult
                            aspects of the United States-Mexican water treaty negotiations.
                            Attention is directed to the following points: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>It is noted that although the Department has been engaged for
                                    several years in building up a situation that, it was hoped,
                                    eventually would end in a favorable water treaty, other agencies
                                    of the Government have carried on negotiations with the Mexican
                                    Government with results that might unfortunately have a very
                                    adverse effect upon the negotiation of this proposed treaty. The
                                    zeal of these other agencies in furthering production of
                                    strategic materials in Mexico is, of course, commendable; but it
                                    is illustrative of the grave difficulty faced by the Department
                                    in the conduct of foreign relations when it apparently does not
                                    have an opportunity to integrate and coordinate all the facets
                                    of the foreign relations of this Government In the present
                                    instance long and complicated negotiations for the development
                                    of certain agricultural projects in Mexico had apparently been
                                    carried on in Mexico without any regard to and knowledge of
                                    other and possibly conflicting negotiations being carried on by
                                    the Department. Unfortunately the Department might be held
                                    responsible for certain consequences that it was not in a
                                    position to prevent. For example, it is not contemplated that
                                    the United States will be able to allocate to Mexico from the
                                    Colorado River any more water than is now being used by Mexico.
                                    However, if other agencies of our Government help Mexico develop
                                    projects in the delta requiring the use of approximately 800,000
                                    additional acre feet of Colorado River water,<note n="67"
                                        xml:id="d513fn67">A marginal note by C. A. Timm reads:
                                        “Apparently abandoned but no proof of this exists in RA
                                        [Division of the American Republics]”.</note> how will it be
                                    possible in the future to say to Mexico that, our need of these
                                    products having ceased, we shall cut off this additional
                                    quantity of water? On the Rio Grande the problem is perhaps
                                    worse. From this river we hope to secure from Mexico an
                                    allocation by treaty of approximately 1,000,000 acre feet per
                                    year. The possible effects of these Rio Grande oil seeds
                                    projects upon these hopes for a fair share of Rio Grande water
                                    should be studied. In all candor it must be asked whether all
                                    these projects contemplated by certain agencies of this
                                    Government will, in the long run, help or hinder the development
                                    of good relations along the border.</item>

                                <item>In all of these matters it is, of course, important to prevent
                                    the <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0635"/>development of an
                                    active spirit of contention and dissension along the border. It
                                    may be thought necessary to implement the program of economic
                                    assistance to Mexico, but this program should assuredly be
                                    closely coordinated and integrated by the Department and not
                                    dispersed among various agencies. Furthermore such a program
                                    should in some manner be tied in with the important water
                                    negotiations. In fact, it should afford a good opportunity to
                                    secure a reduction of Mexican demands on the Colorado and an
                                    increase in Mexico’s offer of water from the Rio Grande. Above
                                    all it should be recognized that the water problem is a life and
                                    death matter in our Southwest, and its solution will have vital
                                    effects upon the long future of both the United States and
                                    Mexican portions of the basins of these boundary streams. It may
                                    even be stated that in the long run good general relations with
                                    Mexico can not be maintained without a satisfactory solution of
                                    the boundary water problems.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The factual situation regarding the San Juan and the Retamal
                                    developments should be pointed out. The San Juan enters the Rio
                                    Grande opposite Rio Grande City, Texas. With an average annual
                                    contribution of nearly 1,000,000 acre” feet, it is the most
                                    important Mexican tributary with the possible exception of the
                                    Conchos. Azúcar Dam, providing a storage capacity of nearly
                                    2,000,000 acre feet will, therefore, be able to hold two years
                                    run-off. Once the reservoir is filled, it can be said that the
                                    effects of the dam will be favorable for Texas as long as the
                                    Mexicans do not use too much of the water supply, for the dam
                                    would tend to provide a more reliable flow of the Lower Rio
                                    Grande in the dry season. Compared with the San Juan Dam the
                                    Retamal heading is, for the time being, more dangerous in that
                                    it can divert the entire flow of the river at a point opposite
                                    Weslaco, being thus above the points of diversion for some of
                                    the largest irrigation districts on the Texas side. Both these
                                    Mexican developments underline the importance of Federal Project
                                    no. 5.</item>

                                <item>Finally, there appears to be ample reason to believe that the
                                    Department will be held very largely responsible by the American
                                    people for any lack of clarity, coherence, unity, and balance in
                                    our foreign policies, not to mention any lack of success in
                                    their prosecution. It stands to reason, then, that the authority
                                    possessed by the Department should be commensurate with its
                                    responsibility.</item>

                            Lawson, acting under authorization, has suggested to Fernández <pb

                        <p>Absence of any agreement, temporary or otherwise, governing diversions of

                            view of both countries to reach an early understanding.</p>
                        <p>Present idea is that Duggan, McGurk, and Timm, together with Lawson and

                            send to El Paso–Juarez representatives similarly authorized.</p>
                        <p>Mexican Embassy has been informed in the sense of the foregoing but, as
                            stated, proposal is being made through Mexican Commissioner, who, it is
                            understood, discussed with Padilla a few days ago a similar
                            procedure.</p>

                                Division of International Stream Waters</hi></p>
                        <p>These discussions started Monday, September 6, with representatives
                            attending from the two sections of the Boundary Commission, the Mexican
                            Foreign Office and the Department.</p>
                        <p>The discussions opened with respect to the division of the Colorado River
                            waters. The offer previously advanced by Commissioner Lawson <pb n="623"
                                xml:id="pg_623" facs="0637"/>of 1,250,000 acre feet was reiterated.
                            The Mexicans made a vague counterproposal which seemed to be based upon
                            an average of 1,700,000 acre feet. On Friday, September 10, we made a
                            new proposal to the Mexicans which was well within the maximum limits of
                            the formula approved at the Sante Fe Conference. Although at the time I
                            left on Tuesday afternoon no reply had been given by the Mexicans to
                            this proposal it is known that the Mexican representatives recommended
                            to the Foreign Office that they accept the formula with certain
                            modifications. The extent of these suggested modifications is not known.
                            The Mexican representatives indicated that the pressure for 1,700,000
                            acre feet came from the Department of Agriculture and that that
                            Department therefore might be expected to be least easy to convince of
                            the desirability of a settlement based upon our formula presented on
                            Friday, September 10.</p>
                        <p>Since last Friday discussions have revolved around division of the waters
                            of the Rio Grande. In the first conversations, each side presented its
                            well-known position. Technical studies made by engineers of the two
                            groups brought out the existence of sufficient water to meet the
                            reasonable demands of both countries. The difficulty was to find a
                            formula satisfactory to both countries that would make available to each
                            country water necessary to cover existing uses and for a reasonable
                            expansion. Our position was that an agreement with Mexico, in order to
                            be attractive to us, would have to provide at least as much water as
                            that which could be available to the United States with the development
                            of Project No. 5 providing for taking flood waters from the Rio Grande
                            through a gravity canal for storage and distribution in the United
                            States. At the time I left each side was endeavoring to devise a formula
                            that would satisfy both the principles for which each country stood and
                            the practical necessities of the case.</p>
                        <p>In general, I am most encouraged by the tenor of the conversations.
                            Although they were slow getting under way, they have now reached a point
                            where both sides are using their best efforts to work out formulas and
                            plans that will present acceptable solutions for both rivers.</p>
                        <p>In the event that agreement in principle is reached, which should be
                            known within another week or two, approximately six weeks to two months
                            would be required to make certain preliminary engineering studies
                            essential to a well founded treaty and for the drafting of the treaty
                            itself. In other words, provided an agreement can be arrived at by
                            October 1, the treaty should be ready for signature by December 1.</p>

                            18, 1943 to Mr. Duggan<note n="69" xml:id="d516fn69">Not printed.</note>
                            you summarized and briefly discussed the present differences between
                            United States and Mexican representatives on the subject of the proposed
                            water treaty. These points have already been the subject of long
                            distance telephone conversations with you; hence this reply to your
                            letter will serve primarily as a confirmation of views already expressed
                            and as a statement of conclusions reached in conferences here. As you
                            already know, the Department concurs with your position in regard to
                            these several points of difference.</p>

                            <item><hi rend="italic">Yuma Drain and Surplus Waters</hi>. It is not
                                yet seen how we can recede from our position that these waters
                                should be charged to Mexico’s allocation. The only alternative would
                                seem to be for the United States to dispose of them in some other
                                manner so as to insure credit for them. It may be, however, that
                                certain concessions might be made in regard to the technical or
                                financial aspects presently governing their disposition; if true,
                                the Department is in need of additional information on this point.
                                Insofar as the position of the Bureau of Reclamation is concerned, I
                                suggested in my conversation of October 19 with Commissioner Bashore
                                that the larger interests involved might make it necessary for the
                                Department to have a free hand in the disposition of the waters in
                                question. It is assumed that this matter is one of the subjects of
                                conversation this week between Mr. Ainsworth and the Bureau
                                officials in Denver.</item>

                                    on the Rio Grande</hi>. It is true that in one of our drafts in
                                El Paso there was presented the idea of a fifty-fifty division of
                                costs and revenues of hydro-electric plants. On the other hand, we
                                attempted from the first to establish the principle that the costs
                                of storage works should bear some relationship to assigned storage
                                capacities. There appears to be some opportunity for compromise on
                                this matter. Nevertheless, it seems that the Mexicans are trying to
                                assure themselves of enough power revenues to pay for their
                                proportion of the costs, with the possibility, even, of future
                                profits. On the other hand, as regards the cost of the major storage
                                reservoirs, the basis of benefits received or to be received, as
                                urged by the Mexicans, would seem to insure that the United States
                                would bear a disproportionate part of the cost. <pb n="625"
                                    xml:id="pg_625" facs="0639"/>At the same time, as I have already
                                stated, it is believed that a fair compromise on the matter of costs
                                should be possible.</item>

                                much opportunity for a compromise. It is not believed that our
                                people would find tolerable any degree of Mexican control over such
                                diversions or diversion works, nor would such control seem to serve
                                any useful purpose so long as diversions were within the allocation
                                of water as provided in the treaty.</item>

                                representatives of the Bureau of Reclamation; hence, there is little
                                that can or need be said at this time. If, as you have suggested,
                                the Bureau of Reclamation tends to favor the location of the Mexican
                                diversion dam in the international section of the river, the
                                suggested figure of 1,000 second feet should suffice to take care of
                                all the Mexican lands lying at too high an elevation to be served
                                from the Mexican dam.</item>

                            <item><hi rend="italic">Surplus Waters of the Colorado</hi>. This point,
                                apparently introduced at the very last by the Mexicans, has, it may
                                be, some dangerous aspects. It seems to be an additional indication
                                that the Mexicans are making every effort to leave certain loopholes
                                in the treaty whereby they will be able in effect to get more than
                                the stated amounts of 1,500,000 and 1,700,000 acre feet. As their
                                proposition appears to us, assuming that the Mexicans develop
                                considerable non-summer uses for water, they could divert without
                                charge large quantities of surplus waters in the fall, winter and
                                spring and then demand during the summer the full amount of A water
                                without exceeding, as a total charge, the technical allocation under
                                the treaty. As you suggest, this proposal would seem to warrant very
                                careful study. If it appears sufficiently dangerous, it may be
                                thought advisable to take a firm position against it in its present
                                form, even at the cost of modifying certain comparable phraseology
                                in the provisions regarding the Rio Grande.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>These points of difference do not appear to present insuperable obstacles
                            to a final solution. At the same time it is not believed that the United
                            States can afford to concede all of them, or all of any one of them.</p>
                        <p>It is our hope that the conversations in Denver will clear the decks as
                            far as the interests of the Bureau of Reclamation are concerned. The way
                            should then be open for the resumption of conversations with the
                            Mexicans in El Paso–Juarez early in November. It has never been our
                            expectation here that any of the differences with the Mexicans could be
                            left to settlement in Mexico City. Furthermore, as you stated, “the
                            exchange of drafts and the adoption of principles are based <pb n="626"
                                xml:id="pg_626" facs="0640"/>on complete approval and not an
                            acceptance of particular paragraphs or principles, since there is a
                            correlation of ideas that presupposes complete and not partial
                            concurrence.”</p>
                        <p>As to whether anyone from the Department will participate in the next
                            meetings will be the subject of immediate consideration. It is
                            understood, however, that the Mexicans desire such participation;
                            consequently, it is assumed that one or more will go from here.</p>

                            the Department’s representatives are determined not to accept terms that
                            make unreasonable demands upon the United States or that go beyond the

                        <p>My letter to you of November 13, while not altogether optimistic in tone,
                            was nevertheless a bit too hopeful. The reasons for this were covered by
                            yesterday’s telephone conversation, and on that general point I should
                            like to make a few additional comments.</p>
                        <p>The major difficulty centers, as we said yesterday, around the effort of
                            the Mexicans to find loopholes by which they could demand virtually all
                            of the 1,500,000 acre-feet at points above the lower boundary, thus
                            insuring, first, that most of the allocation would be practically fresh
                            water, and second, that in time they could be virtually assured of
                            having the use of several hundred thousand acre-feet of usable water
                            without charge against their allocation. This last named quantity would
                            be available for their Sonora lands, which, we understand, may in time
                            reach 100,000 acres in extent.</p>
                        <p>On our part, we went on the assumption that the basic point of an
                            over-all quantity of 1,500,000 acre-feet had been accepted by the
                            Mexicans and that this total would include water made available for them
                            at all points. We introduced the question of the point of diversion on
                            the lower boundary and also diversions through the All-American only in
                            order to evidence our desire to be of such practical assistance to the
                            Mexicans as was feasible. …</p>
                        <p>During a conference yesterday afternoon, lasting from four until
                            six-thirty, the Mexicans (especially Orive Alba), gave further
                            expression to their views; but they also made it clear that they were
                            loath to break off negotiations. They proposed that we present a draft
                            treaty and that they take this draft to Mexico City for further
                            discussion and instructions, after which they would promptly return to
                            El Paso. In this same conference we adopted a somewhat firmer tone in
                            regard to our basic proposition. Also, in a few well chosen words, Joe
                            made it abundantly clear to them that the Commissioner’s proposals
                            represented the views of the Department. This they finally and
                            explicitly recognized. Today we are drawing up a clear-cut statement of
                            our position on the basic points at issue. This will be discussed with
                            the Mexicans this afternoon at four.</p>
                        <p>Without elaborating too much, it may be that the following conclusions
                            are warranted: <list>

                                    that is, to the effect that Maxico would not be charged with
                                    more than 60,000 acre-feet of Yuma drain and waste water.</item>

                                <item>There is, I believe, no reason for us to go beyond the Santa

                                    from the tentative agreements regarding the Rio Grande, even if
                                    the conferences threaten, by reason of our firmness, to break up
                                    for a while with the Department having, as a result, to report
                                    failure to the Committee of Fourteen and Sixteen. I believe that
                                    the result would strengthen the department, both as against
                                    Mexico and as regards the Committee. Although it is by no means
                                    certain that the discussions will not terminate for the present,
                                    it seems clear to me that the Mexicans are very desirous of
                                    getting a treaty and that, all things considered, they need a
                                    treaty more than we do.</item>

                                    believed that any competent, fair tribunal would give to Mexico
                                    an award more favorable than or even as favorable as our
                                    proposals. Much might depend upon the composition of the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Stettinius</hi>: On November 24, 1943,
                            representatives of the Department and of the Foreign Office agreed, as
                            the result of negotiations in El Paso–Juarez lasting several weeks, upon
                            the terms of a draft treaty on apportionment, control, and use of the
                            waters of the Colorado River and of the Rio Grande below Fort Quitman,
                            Texas.</p>

                                substantially the same as the treaty signed on February 3, 1944,
                                Department of State Treaty Series No. 994; 59 Stat. (pt. 2)

                            are attached hereto. More briefly stated, the draft agreement, in
                            respect of the Rio Grande, allocates to the United States somewhat more
                            than one-half of the waters reaching the main stream of this river each
                            year. The two Governments undertake to build three major storage dams
                            and the necessary auxiliary works on this river.</p>
                        <p>As for the Colorado River, the United States guarantees to Mexico

                            formulated by Mexico under certain limitations that adequately protect
                            United States uses on this river. Both Governments undertake <pb n="629"

                            recall, I sent you by regular mail and without a covering letter a copy
                            of the memorandum of conversation of December 10, 1943,<note n="78"
                                xml:id="d520fn78">Not printed.</note> between Mr. McGurk and Mr.
                            Torres Bodet in regard to the desire of Mexico to bring about a
                            “regularization” of the “illegal” Mexican diversions in the Juárez
                            Valley. Under date of December 20, 1943, Mr. Duggan sent Ambassador
                            Messersmith a letter<note n="78" xml:id="d520fn79">Not printed.</note>
                            approving the position that the Ambassador and Mr. McGurk had taken to
                            the effect that the Juarez water problem cannot be discussed, either by
                            exchange of notes or otherwise, until the water treaty has been
                            ratified, but that thereafter, this problem might be explored by the two
                            Boundary Commissioners.</p>
                        <p>In my own conversations regarding this matter, I have taken the position
                            that the Mexicans should be given no reason to hope for a solution,
                            favorable to them, of the problem they have created by their own illegal
                            operations. In developing this subject, I have pointed out two or three
                            reasons why it will be difficult to agree with the Mexican position. In
                            the first place, no more water above El Paso can be made available. In
                            the second place, the time may come when the water users of the El Paso
                            Valley may consider it feasible and <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630"
                                facs="0644"/>economically justifiable to construct such works as
                            will take from the river virtually all the quantity of water now being
                            illegally diverted by the Mexicans. In the third place, even if this
                            water, legally the property of the United States, were not used in the
                            El Paso Valley, it would, if left in the river, have the effect of
                            relieving certain unfavorable conditions farther down the river,
                            especially in the upper part of the Presidio Valley. In the fourth
                            place, there is, of course, a very important political aspect of the
                            matter, since any attempt to reopen the Treaty of 1906<note n="79"
                                xml:id="d520fn80">Convention providing for the equitable
                                distribution of the waters of the Rio Grande for irrigation

                            very likely raise a storm of protests in the El Paso Valley and in the
                            valley above El Paso.</p>
                        <p>I have summarized these points in the hope of getting your comments on
                            them. I should like also to know whether you believe that, in an effort
                            to settle the matter, we could safely go so far as to offer terms by
                            which the Mexican water users would be allowed to divert from this same
                            reach if [<hi rend="italic">of</hi>] the river roughly the amount of the
                            estimated return flow and drainage from their treaty allocation of
                            60,000 acre-feet. Would this give them a total, including the 60,000
                            acre-feet, of 80,000–90,000 acre-feet? I am not advocating this
                            concession, but I do want your opinion of it.</p>

                        <p>The Mexican Ambassador called at his request. He had just returned from
                            Mexico and reported that everything was coming along very well in his
                            country.</p>
                        <p>I brought up the question of the tentative water power agreement in
                            respect to the Colorado and the Rio Grande Rivers. I explained to him
                            how emergency engagements, and for some days the flu, have thwarted our
                            constant efforts to lay the whole water treaty proposal before Senator
                            Connally and the other Senators from the interested states, and that
                            therefore it would be impossible for us to sign the treaty during this
                            year. The Ambassador said that he had heard of this situation and that
                            since the Mexican Congress will adjourn at the end of December until
                            next September, he suggested that we go along as rapidly as possible in
                            securing the ratification of the treaty by the United States Senate, and
                            then his President could call the Mexican Senate into special session
                            for similar ratification. I said that we would do our best along these
                            lines.</p>

                            nos. 734 of February 13, 1943, 790 of February 26, 1943, and 829 of
                            March 9, 1943<note n="1" xml:id="d522fn1">None printed.</note> relative
                            to Emergency Decrees of Nicaragua imposing supervision and control over
                            the property of enemy nationals, and to report that the new legislation
                            anticipated in those despatches has been prepared. The draft has been
                            delivered to a member of the Embassy staff by the Minister of Hacienda,
                            Dr. Ramon Sevilla Sacasa, and a copy of it in Spanish, together with an
                            informal translation, is transmitted herewith.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d522fn2">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>The proposed legislation has been incorporated in drafts of two
                            ostensibly unconnected laws. The first relates exclusively to the future
                            administration, taxation, expropriation, and sale of the property of
                            enemy aliens and the investment of sale proceeds in defense bonds; the
                            second authorizes the issuance of such bonds and prescribes their terms.
                            In many respects the proposed legislation is modeled on that enacted by
                            Costa Rica for similar purposes. It will require a more drastic
                            occupation of and intervention in the business enterprises of enemy
                            aliens in all instances, and is expected to result in decrees for the
                            forced transfer and total liquidation of them in most. It will hence <pb
                                n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0647"/>be seen that the Nicaraguan
                            Government has elected to adopt the more effective of the two
                            alternatives for control of business enterprises required by Resolution
                            VII of the Inter-American Conference on Systems of Economic and

                        <p>As stated in the prior despatches, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>, Dr.
                            Leopoldo Arguello Gil, attorney to the Minister of Hacienda, was charged
                            with the preparation of the drafts early last March. After many
                            consultations with a member of the Embassy staff he stated early in
                            April that his work had been completed; that he would submit the draft
                            to the Minister of Hacienda, who was not expected to change it on any
                            material point, and would then send a copy to the Embassy for
                            examination and criticism. Delivery of any copy to the Embassy was
                            postponed from day to day, and no satisfactory explanation of the delay
                            was offered. Rumors were current that no such law would be decreed;
                            later, that President Somoza intended to present it to Congress with
                            instructions for its defeat there. About the middle of April, when
                            pressed for delivery, Dr. Arguello Gil stated that he was himself at a
                            loss to understand what had happened to his draft; that he had requested
                            the Minister to return it, and was delaying a planned vacation to Mexico
                            on that account. He left for Mexico the latter part of April.</p>
                        <p>As the Embassy received no information about the draft or prospects of
                            its enactment, I mentioned the matter to President Somoza on May 25. He
                            assured me that he was confident that the law would pass, and promised
                            to mention it to members of Congress the following day. A member of the
                            Embassy staff called lately on the Minister of Hacienda and received
                            from him a copy of the draft. The Embassy’s views and criticism were
                            invited. As it is expected that the bill will soon be presented to the
                            Nicaraguan Congress, it is requested that the Department transmit its
                            comments as expeditiously as possible.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State refers to the Embassy’s despatch no. 1130 of June
                            7, 1943 which transmits a draft<note n="4" xml:id="d523fn4">Draft not

                            enemy nationals in Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>As a general comment, the proposed drafts appear to have been the subject
                            of thorough and careful study and seem well adapted to meet the end
                            desired. The present draft, it is noted, relies much more upon
                            administrative discretion than the previous draft legislation,<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d523fn5">The draft transmitted by despatch No. 1130
                                refers to Decree No. 70 of December 16, 1941, No. 77 of February 17,
                                1942, and supplementary decrees of February 15 and March 1, 1943,
                                Decrees Nos. 71 and 72 of December 16, 1941, also apply.</note> and
                            the effectiveness of the new law, if adopted, will therefore depend to a
                            greater extent upon the energy with which the administrative bodies in
                            charge of its being carried out attack the problem and prove themselves
                            resistant to political and other pressures.</p>
                        <p>The granting of administrative discretion under the law will, however,
                            afford opportunity to limit the expropriation to the property of
                            Proclaimed List nationals who are, in the terms of the Department’s
                            present categories “inherently bad”. The Department’s views on the
                            undesirability of extending expropriation to persons not on the
                            Proclaimed List are well known to the Embassy and need not be discussed
                            here. In addition, it is noted that the earlier economic warfare
                            measures adopted by Nicaragua will remain in full force and effect
                            except as the same may be repealed by implication by the new law. As a
                            result, interventorship or other action of a lesser degree of severity
                            than expropriation will be permissible in those cases where such action
                            is deemed desirable.</p>
                        <p>While the proposed drafts deal, primarily with the expropriation of
                            properties owned by Proclaimed List and enemy nationals, it is noted
                            that other provisions of the proposed laws, if effectively administered,
                            should permit the closing of other previous gaps in the Nicaraguan
                            control laws. Specific comments on such provisions are made below. As
                            the proposed legislation seems to follow closely, in its essential
                            aspects, the legislation heretofore adopted by Costa Rica, a copy of the
                            proposed legislation is being forwarded by the Department together with
                            a copy of this instruction, to the Embassy at San José, with the request
                            that it forward to the Embassy any suggestions it might have on the
                            proposed legislation. Since the Embassy at Costa Rica has dealt with the
                            practical application of the comparable Costa Rican law for a period of
                            over six months, it should be in a unique position to make suggestions
                            as to possible improvements in the proposed Nicaraguan legislation.
                            Nevertheless, many of the comments made in this instruction are based
                            upon problems which have arisen out of the Costa Rican law as reported
                            to the Department by the Embassy at San José.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0649"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft">The Embassy may wish to consider the desirability of
                            discussing such suggestions with the appropriate Nicaraguan authorities
                            for such action as they may deem appropriate. The Department would
                            appreciate being kept fully informed of the status of the adoption of
                            the proposed legislation and any changes therein which are suggested or
                            made from time to time. It should be noted that the Department has not
                            attempted to pass upon the legal procedure set forth in the proposed
                            legislation, as such matters depend primarily upon the provisions of the
                            local civil code, with which the Department is not sufficiently familiar
                            to pass judgment.</p>

                            describing discussions being held by the Nicaraguan officials and
                            members of the Embassy staff with regard to proposed Nicaraguan
                            legislation providing, among other things, for the expropriation of
                            properties owned by Proclaimed List nationals in Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>The Department, of course, will be pleased to see the passage of
                            legislation implementing more fully the Washington and Rio de Janeiro
                                Resolutions<note n="7" xml:id="d524fn7">For correspondence on the
                                Third Meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the American Republics,
                                held at Rio de Janeiro January 15–28, 1942, see <ref

                            The Department nevertheless deems it appropriate to interject a note of
                            caution which should be borne in mind in discussions between members of
                            the Embassy staff and the Nicaraguan officials concerning the proposed
                            legislation. As you know, the Department has always taken the position
                            that economic warfare legislation, particularly when providing for
                            expropriation or liquidation of Proclaimed List enterprises, should
                            permit a high degree of selectivity in its operation. The Department
                            appreciates the difficulties inherent, under the circumstances existing
                            in Nicaragua, of granting broad administrative discretion in providing
                            for expropriation or liquidation and that legislation, although
                            mandatory in form, will be applied selectively in its actual
                            administration. Notwithstanding these circumstances, however, it is felt
                            that members of the Embassy staff should not suggest that the proposed
                            legislation should be mandatory in terms so as to avoid taking a
                            position which might be inconsistent with the selective approach which
                            this Government has always deemed highly desirable.</p>

                        <p>In view of the changes in the proposed Nicaraguan legislation as a result
                            of the suggestions made by the Embassy<note n="8" xml:id="d524fn8"
                                >Suggestions outlined in despatch No. 1216 of June 25, 1943 (not
                                printed), were designed to (1) clarify the scope of business
                                enterprises subject to expropriation, (2) speed administrative
                                action on expropriation proceedings, (3) designate more clearly
                                which native Nicaraguans would not be exempt from expropriation
                                action, (4) provide for the purchase of expropriated property by a
                                limited number of approved nationals of allied countries, (5)
                                withhold from expropriation property more than half owned by
                                non-effected nationals, and (6) impose stiffer penalties on those
                                concealing goods subject to expropriation.</note> pursuant to the
                            request of the Nicaraguans, it is the Department’s view that the
                            proposed legislation, if adopted and effectively administered, will
                            permit a fairly complete implementation of the Washington Resolutions by
                            the Nicaraguan Government. If the proposed legislation is passed,
                            therefore, it is suggested that it might be appropriate for the Embassy
                            to express this Government’s gratification at the cooperation which has
                            been shown by the Nicaraguan Government in matters affecting the war
                            effort of the United Nations. The Department wishes to emphasize,
                            however, that the matter of enacting legislation is a matter for the
                            sovereign determination of Nicaragua. The Embassy should therefore
                            refrain from offering advice with regard to the details of proposed
                            legislation except as it may be requested, and should not insist upon
                            the enactment of specific legislative provisions which the Nicaraguan
                            authorities are reluctant to adopt.</p>

                            Hacienda to incorporate the various changes and amendments approved by
                            the House and Senate, but as this text may not be available for some
                            time, a report is sent without further delay.</p>
                        <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0651"/>
                        <p>Note was promptly taken by the staff member of the Department’s
                            precautionary suggestion that expropriation legislation should permit a
                            high degree of selectivity in its operation and that the Embassy should
                            refrain from offering advice with regard to details except as it might
                            be requested and should not insist upon the enactment of specific
                            legislative provisions which the Nicaraguan authorities are reluctant to
                            adopt. In this connection I wish to point out that the mandatory
                            character of existing control decrees, which the Ministry of Hacienda
                            carried into the original draft of the present bill, was not a
                            suggestion of the Embassy but a preference of the Nicaraguan
                            administration for reasons set forth in despatch no. 1295. As the
                            nationality of many foreign-born residents and native Nicaraguans born
                            of one or two foreign parents was unsettled and controversial, the
                            committee on nationality created by Art. 47 of Decree no. 77 could fail
                            to certify that an unobjectionable person was of enemy nationality and
                            thereby exempt him from control without exposing itself to a charge of
                            inconsistency with the determination of some other branch of the
                            government.</p>
                        <p>Early in the summer, however, the Defensa Nacional de Nicaragua required
                            all foreign residents to register, prescribing a penalty for failure to
                            do so. As a result the nationality of each person in the country became
                            a matter of official record. After the House committee to which the
                            expropriation bill was referred had recommended in a proposed report
                            that a Consulting Commission be authorized to make exemptions, Dr.
                            Leopoldo Arguello Gil, the attorney to Hacienda, informed the staff
                            member that the administration was now disposed to accept that
                            recommendation since Defensa Nacional had already passed on all
                            questions of nationality in the country and a failure to adopt its
                            finding for control purposes would expose the government to a charge of
                            inconsistency. The staff member agreed to its propriety, suggesting,
                            however, that the Consulting Commission be empowered to grant exemptions
                            only on the approval of Defensa Nacional. Dr. Arguello accepted the
                            amendment as a means of spreading responsibility and relieving the
                            Commission <hi rend="italic">pro tanto</hi> of personal pressure in that
                            its refusal to exempt could be imputed to Defensa Nacional. The bill as
                            passed retains these provisions which will, it is hoped, meet with the
                            Department’s approval.</p>
                        <p>In reference to the Department’s caution against offering unsolicited
                            advice to Nicaraguan officials or insisting on details of proposed
                            legislation, it may be said that the staff member has been careful not
                            to do so in any instance. His problem, on the contrary, has often been
                            to refrain from making solicited suggestions on matters in which the
                            United States has no interest. Dr. Arguello frequently calls on him at
                            the Embassy or requests him to come to the Ministry for consultations
                                <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0652"/>not only relating to the
                            bill but also to obtain his views on administrative questions which the
                            National Bank has referred to the Minister. All of his conferences with
                            the Minister have been at the Minister’s request. His relations with Dr.
                            Arguello, moreover, are close personally as well as officially, and
                            their exchange of ideas is in an atmosphere of informality.</p>
                        <p>On July 24, 1943 Dr. Arguello brought him a copy of the proposed House
                            Committee Report on the expropriation bill before it had been submitted
                            to Congress. This report had been given to the Minister of Hacienda for
                            his reaction. It was left in the strictest confidence with the staff
                            member for detailed study. A few days later Dr. Arguello called to
                            review and discuss with him the proposed changes. Both agreed that the
                            committee’s revision of the first two articles emasculated the bill by
                            restricting the properties subject to expropriation to those which could
                            not be otherwise used in commerce; by injecting unnecessarily a hearing
                            which could postpone expropriation indefinitely; and by permitting the
                            exclusion of proclaimed Nicaraguans from any effective control. After
                            they had agreed that these and a few other revisions were objectionable,
                            the staff member called on the Minister by invitation and in Dr.
                            Arguello’s presence reviewed the criticisms. The Minister listened
                            attentively and stated that he would discuss the report privately with
                            the committee. He did so and the committee made revisions to conform in
                            large measure to the suggestions. A translation of the report is
                            submitted herewith.<note n="10" xml:id="d525fn10">Not printed.</note>
                            Portions of the original draft which were deleted on the Minister’s
                            recommendation are enclosed in parentheses; additions to the original
                            draft are underscored. It will be noted that the committee did not
                            recede from its recommendation that a hearing be given the affected
                            party, but it did make some changes in procedure which should expedite
                            expropriation sales. Dr. Arguello stated that the criticisms were
                            received and discussed by the committee in a judicial manner; that the
                            committee members were in favor of the bill as a whole as a necessary
                            war measure, and this attitude was clearly manifest in their defense of
                            it in the Chamber. A translation of the reported debate in the Chamber
                            is attached.<note n="10" xml:id="d525fn11">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>The bill was approved by the Chamber of Deputies on August 6, 1943; was
                            thereafter referred to a Senate committee which made a few minor changes
                            and reported favorably. The Senate approved the bill so revised on
                            August 20. On August 30 Dr. Arguello called the staff member to say that
                            the bill had been assembled by the Ministry of Hacienda to incorporate
                            the changes made and had been sent to the Presidential Mansion, but no
                            copy was yet available. For the Department’s <pb n="639" xml:id="pg_639"

                            This copy was compiled by the Embassy staff member on the basis of the

                        <p>274. Your 224, May 21, 7 p.m. The Panamanian Cabinet discussed the Senate
                            bill yesterday and this morning the Acting Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs<note n="4" xml:id="d527fn4">Victor F. Goytía.</note> gave me
                            a note<note n="5" xml:id="d527fn5">Note No. 5253, May 25, 1943, not
                                printed.</note> setting out the Panamanian point of view, that it
                            would be contrary to the text and spirit of article IV of the Defense
                            Sites Agreement for the civil courts of the Canal Zone to exercise
                            jurisdiction in relation to the defense sites; and that the retention of
                            sovereignty of Panama over the sites as set out in article IV of the
                            Agreement is incompatible with a consolidating policy of general
                            character applicable to civilian communities in which the United States
                            acts as territorial sovereign. The note suggests consultation between
                            the two Governments regarding this matter. It seems to be the point of
                            view of Panamanian Government that the jurisdiction granted the United
                            States by article IV should be exercised only by military tribunals.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Minister assured me that the Panamanian Government had not the
                            slightest intention of contesting or calling into question the
                            jurisdiction specifically granted the United States in article IV. On
                            the contrary, he said, that the Panamanian Government reaffirmed this
                            grant of jurisdiction, and considered that it was simply a question of
                            having such jurisdiction exercised in a manner compatible with the
                            provisions of article IV.</p>
                        <p>Copy of the note is being forwarded by airmail. The Panamanian Government
                            would greatly appreciate it if no action were taken by Congress on the
                            bill until the United States Government has considered the note and
                            opportunity been afforded for consultation between the two
                            Governments.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 4156 of May 26, 1943, which transmitted copy of Foreign Office note
                            No. 5253 of May 25<note n="6" xml:id="d528fn6">Neither printed.</note>
                            in reference to Senate Bill S. 1115 providing for the exercise by <pb

                        <p>I have discussed this matter with the Commanding General<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d528fn7">Lt. Gen. George H. Brett.</note> who informs me
                            that investigation discloses that the Bill, as now presented to
                            Congress, was initiated in the Panama Canal Department<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d528fn8">One of the overseas departments of the War
                                Department.</note> on June 18, 1942, “and was caused by certain
                            legal conditions that had to be handled”. In this connection General
                            Brett has furnished me copies of two memoranda dated respectively May 26
                            and May 29, 1943, prepared by the Judge Advocate, Panama Canal
                                Department.<note n="9" xml:id="d528fn9">Col. Eugene F. Smith.</note>
                            Copies of these memoranda are enclosed herewith.<note n="10"
                                xml:id="d528fn10">Neither printed.</note></p>
                        <p>In thinking over this matter, certain observations occur to me which I am
                            jotting down herewith for whatever they may be worth:</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that we are not perhaps primarily concerned with insisting
                            upon our unilateral interpretation of the nature of the rights which we
                            consider were obtained by the United States in Article IV of the May 18,
                            1942 Agreement. Rather, it seems to me, it may be primarily a matter of
                            conciliating the rights of jurisdiction under Article IV which we
                            consider essential to the defense of The Panama Canal, with the
                            essential attributes of sovereignty which Panama considers were retained
                            by Panama under Article IV.</p>
                        <p>The Judge Advocate’s memorandum of May 26 states that while it would be
                            possible without such legislation as that contemplated in S. 1115 for
                            criminal offenses committed by military personnel and civilian employees
                            of the War Department and such other persons as may come within the
                            provisions of Article of War 2 to be tried by courts-martial, there
                            would be no forum short of a court in the United States and in some
                            cases not even there in which civil actions which might arise from acts
                            of military or civil personnel and their families committed on those
                            sites could be tried. In considering this matter, the question at once
                            arises as to the procedure followed in the case of civil actions of the
                            nature cited which arise from acts of military or civil personnel on
                            defense sites made available to the United States in other countries of
                            Latin America, for instance, on the Galápagos Islands, at Salinas, in
                            Costa Rica, Guatemala, etc., as well as in the bases in the British West
                            Indies. I have inquired of the military authorities here regarding this
                            point but have been informed that they have no information concerning
                            it. Presumably, I was informed, such actions have to be taken to some
                            court in the United States. If this is the case, it would seem that a
                            similar procedure might well be considered as regards such actions
                            occurring on the defense sites in the Republic of Panamá.</p>
                        <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0657"/>
                        <p>I am informed that the main purpose of the military authorities in
                            drafting the Bill was to insure that United States personnel on the
                            defense sites have the same opportunity to have recourse to United
                            States civil courts in the Canal Zone as have United States personnel
                            residing within the Canal Zone. This would seem to constitute exactly
                            the case which the Government of Panamá makes against the Bill. That
                            Government considers that the defense sites in the Republic of Panamá
                            can in no way be assimilated to the Canal Zone. Panamá considers that it
                            granted the United States the temporary use of these defense sites not
                            for the permanent and broader objectives relating to the Canal Zone, but
                            for purposes strictly limited not only in time but in nature, ie.,
                            purposes of national defense during the present emergency. Obviously it
                            would be more convenient for United States personnel on the defense
                            sites to have the Canal Zone courts exercise jurisdiction over civil
                            questions affecting them, rather than have to take their cases to some
                            court in the United States, perhaps after the end of the war. But as
                            against this matter of personal convenience—which seems indeed to have
                            little relation to the essential purpose of national defense—there is,
                            from the point of view of the Government of Panamá, a principle at stake
                            which it regards as important inasmuch as it affects the sovereignty of
                            the Republic.</p>
                        <p>It would seem rather that the essential purpose of the United States
                            Government in seeking by Article IV to obtain exclusive jurisdiction in
                            all respects over the civil and military personnel of the United States
                            situated on the defense sites, and their families, was to insure that
                            there would be no attempt by Panamanian authorities to assert
                            jurisdiction over such civil and military personnel of the United States
                            and their families, since such attempt might prejudice our defense
                            effort in those areas. We were not primarily concerned with providing a
                            readily accessible forum in the Canal Zone to which military or civil
                            personnel on the defense sites could have recourse for divorce
                            proceedings and the probate of wills.</p>
                        <p>The Judge Advocate also points out in his memorandum of May 26 that
                            without the proposed legislation there is no forum in which a person
                            other than a Panamanian citizen, charged with maliciously committing any
                            crime against the safety of the military installations in any of the
                            defense sites, may be tried if that person is not one of those subject
                            to trial by a military tribunal. He points out for example that a
                            national of a friendly country (other than Panamá) not an employee of
                            our Government, who wilfully and without authority entered one of the
                            sites and stole or destroyed defense equipment could not be tried by a
                            military tribunal. It occurs to me that an appropriate remedy for this
                            situation, since in any case legislation must be enacted by the United
                            States Congress for the trial of such <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644"
                                facs="0658"/>offenders, would be to empower United States military
                            tribunals to try such offenders within the defense sites in the Republic
                            of Panamá during the period of temporary occupation contemplated by the
                            May 18, 1942 Agreement. Or it may be that the jurisdiction of military
                            tribunals could be extended in this respect by order of the Secretary of
                            War, without necessity of legislation—I am not informed on this
                            point.</p>

                            4156 of May 26, 1943 enclosing a note, no. 5253 dated May 25, 1943,<note
                                n="11" xml:id="d529fn11">Neither printed.</note> from the Ministry
                            of Foreign Affairs with relation to S. 1115, a bill to provide for the
                            exercise by the United States of certain jurisdiction over persons
                            within areas in the Republic of Panama, the temporary use of which for
                            defense purposes is granted to the United States.</p>
                        <p>The note states that the Government of Panama considers that the exercise
                            by civil courts of the Canal Zone of jurisdiction in the areas covered
                            by the Defense Sites Agreement is not in accordance with the text and
                            spirit of Article IV of the Agreement and that the extension to the
                            defense sites of legislation of a general character applicable to
                            civilian communities in which the United States acts as territorial
                            sovereign is incompatible with the retention by Panama of sovereignty
                            over the defense sites as provided for in Article IV of the Agreement.
                            You state that it is the desire of the Government of Panama to avoid the
                            creation or the appearance of the creation of any “little Canal Zones”
                            in Panamanian territory or the extension to territory under the
                            jurisdiction of Panamá of the Canal Zone regime. The Ministry of Foreign
                            Affairs apparently considers that the jurisdiction granted to the United
                            States by Article IV of the Defense Sites Agreement should be exercised
                            by its military tribunals.</p>
                        <p>The questions raised have been discussed with the War Department at whose
                            instance S. 1115 and its companion bill, H.R. 2822, were introduced. The
                            War Department has indicated its willingness to amend the proposed
                            legislation in such a way as to make it clear that the United States is
                            not endeavoring to create “little Canal Zones” on Panamanian territory
                            but is simply enacting the minimum legislation necessary in order to be
                            able to exercise the right granted by Article IV “to arrest, try and
                            punish all persons who, in such areas, maliciously commit any crime
                            against the safety of the military installations <pb n="645"
                                xml:id="pg_645" facs="0659"/>therein”. Courts-martial of the United
                            States exercise jurisdiction only over members of the armed forces of
                            the United States and civilians connected with such forces. It would
                            thus be impossible at present for such courts to punish offenses against
                            the safety of military installations in the defense sites if committed
                            by other persons. It is not considered desirable to attempt to amend the
                            Articles of War to extend the jurisdiction of courts-martial to punish
                            civilians generally even for offenses of the nature indicated. In order
                            therefore to punish persons over whom courts-martial have at present no
                            jurisdiction and who commit offenses against the safety of military
                            installations in the defense sites it is necessary to extend American
                            law to offenses committed in such areas. It is also necessary to give to
                            the nearest United States court jurisdiction of such offenses in much
                            the same way that jurisdiction to punish crimes committed on the high
                            seas rest in the district court of the United States of the first
                            district into which the offender is brought. In this connection it is
                            pointed out that there is nothing in Article IV which requires the
                            “exclusive jurisdiction” conferred on the United States to be exercised
                            in any particular way or by any particular type of tribunal.</p>

                            is prepared to make out of deference to Panama are as follows: <list>

                                    view of the Panamanian objection, may safely be eliminated from

                        <p>The Department feels that the amendment of the bills in the manner
                            indicated should allay any apprehension of the Panamanian Government
                            that it is the intention or desire of the United States to extend the
                            Canal Zone regime in any manner to the areas covered by the Defense
                            Sites Agreement. It is necessary in order to protect the military
                            installations in such sites that the United States be able to exercise
                            the jurisdiction granted to it by Article IV of the Agreement which it
                            is observed from your telegram no. 274 of May 26, 1943 the Acting
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs has assured you the Panamanian Government
                            has “not the slightest intention of contesting or calling into
                            question”.</p>
                        <p>The bills referred to above are before the Judiciary Committees of both
                            Houses of Congress and while the Department can give no assurance that
                            action will not be taken thereon it will endeavor to have such action
                            deferred until you have had an opportunity to discuss the matter with
                            the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in the sense indicated <pb n="647"
                                xml:id="pg_647" facs="0661"/>above. If the solution suggested is
                            acceptable to the Ministry you will please inform the Department by
                            telegraph in order that legislation which will permit this Government to
                            punish offenses against military installations in the defense sites may
                            be provided as expeditiously as possible.</p>

                        <p>As reported in my airgram I discussed this matter the, morning of July 3
                            with the Foreign Minister. I left with him the text of the amendments to
                            S. 1115 and its companion bill which the War Department is prepared to
                            make, as given on pages 2–3 of the Department’s instruction. I also
                            urged the Minister, in line with the last paragraph of the Department’s
                            instruction, to give me a reply in this matter as quickly as possible.

                                the defense sites as equivalent to residence in the Canal Zone, and
                                to treating as defense sites areas conceded under “substantially

                            assuming that this will take place in the next few months, it would seem
                            that immediate consideration should also be given to the form and
                            phraseology of the documents that will be drawn up to affect the legal
                            transfer to Panama of the water and sewerage systems and the railroad
                            lots. Officers of the Department in a preliminary way discussed with Mr.
                            S. W. Wang, the Executive Secretary of The Panama Canal, during his
                            recent visit to Washington, some of the questions which undoubtedly will
                            arise in the preparation of whatever instruments of conveyance are used.
                            Mr. Wang was definitely of the opinion that the drafting of these
                            documents should be initiated by Canal Zone authorities in Panama where
                            easy consultation could be arranged with employees of your staff. He
                            expressed his willingness to begin this draft immediately upon his
                            return to the Canal Zone.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the transfer of the railroad lots,<note n="21"
                                xml:id="d532fn21">Point 2 of the Twelve Point Agreement provided for
                                the transfer to Panama, without cost, lands of the Panama Railroad
                                Company not needed for operating the canal, its auxiliary works, or
                                the railroad.</note> the instrument of conveyance presumably will be
                            drawn up in conformity with the laws of Panama. Whether this conveyance
                            is made by quitclaim deed or by warranty deed would seem to be
                            important, inasmuch as there may arise out of the very nature and type
                            of deed used to transfer the lots, the question of this Government’s
                            title to those lands which are being retained as necessary for the
                            operation of the railroad and the operation, maintenance, sanitation and
                            protection of the Panama Canal. Since Panama has constantly maintained
                            that the title to the railroad lots would revert to that Republic in
                                1966,<note n="22" xml:id="d532fn22">This claim was based on the
                                contention that Panama succeeded to the rights of Colombia and New
                                Granada with respect to the 99-year lease granted to the Panama
                                Railroad Company in 1867 by New Granada.</note> it seems advisable,
                            if possible, to draft the instrument of conveyance in such a way as to
                            gain recognition (even if by implication) from the Panamanian
                            authorities that this Government has full and legal title to the lots
                            which are not being transferred at this time. Mr. Wang seemed to think
                            that for the best interests of this Government a transfer by warranty
                            deed would be preferable. As you are aware, there appears to be no

                            1943, regarding the preparation of a concise proposal for a management
                            contract under the provisions of which The Panama Canal would continue
                            to operate the water and sewerage systems in the cities of Panamá and
                            Colón once the title to them has been transferred to the Panamanian
                            Government. (For a review of conversations with Canal Zone authorities

                        <p>Governor now furnished me, under date of a transmitting letter of
                            February 8, 1943, with a memorandum of February 5<note n="26"
                                xml:id="d533fn26">Neither printed.</note> prepared by Colonel C. G.
                            Holle, Assistant Engineer of Maintenance, on the subject of the proposed
                            transfer of the water and sewerage systems of the cities of Panamá and
                            Colón. Governor Edgerton has informed me that his memorandum was
                            submitted as a basis for discussions with me on the subject, and that
                            before formulating any conclusions more definite and final than it
                            presents, he desired to discuss this rather complicated subject with me
                            at more length. I have today had a discussion of the subject with the
                            Governor, and report hereinafter in more detail concerning such
                            discussion. In the meanwhile, and while recognizing that Colonel Holle’s
                            memorandum was prepared merely as a basis of discussion, I think it
                            advisable to transmit herewith a single copy for the Department’s
                            information, since the memorandum presents information which will be of
                            considerable interest to the Department. Incidentally, Governor Edgerton
                            expects to leave the Canal Zone in a few days for Washington to attend
                                <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0665"/>the hearings on The Panamá
                            Canal budget, and he will undoubtedly call at the Department, as is his
                            custom, in order to discuss with officials of the Division of the
                            American Republics matters relating to Panamá.</p>
                        <p>I shall cover hereinafter the more important points discussed this
                            morning with Governor Edgerton:</p>
                                <p>(1). <hi rend="italic">Question of authority for The Panamá
                                            Canal to enter into a management contract with the
                                            Republic of Panamá</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">Paragraph 3,
                                            Holle memorandum</hi>).</p>
                                    <p>It was agreed that statutory authority would probably not be
                                        required and that The Panama Canal could enter into a
                                        contract with the Republic of Panamá to manage the water and
                                        sewerage systems if authority to do so were conveyed to the
                                        Governor by the President of the United States. Presumably
                                        the President, after Congress has approved the pending
                                        legislation affecting Panamá, will issue an Executive Order
                                        authorizing the transfer of the railroad lots and the water
                                        and sewerage systems. In the Executive Order the President
                                        could also authorize the Governor of The Panama Canal to
                                        make appropriate arrangements, if desired by Panamá, to
                                        continue to operate the water and sewerage systems once they
                                        are passed to Panamanian ownership, as a measure of
                                        cooperation with Panamá, for such period as may be desired
                                        by Panamá. Probably the first document which should be
                                        drafted and considered by the State Department is the text
                                        of the Executive Order. Governor Edgerton’s office will
                                        draft this Executive Order and will consult with the Embassy
                                        regarding it, after which the draft will be forwarded to the
                                        State Department.</p>
                                <p>(2). <hi rend="italic">The water and sewerage systems of New
                                            Cristobal.</hi></p>
                                    <p>Colonel Holle’s memorandum treats in detail of this question
                                        (paragraph 5, K (3), pages 9–12). It will be noted that the
                                        recommendation is made that, because of the special
                                        situation of the water and sewerage systems of New
                                            Cristobal,<note n="27" xml:id="d533fn27">Most of the

                                        to Panamá but should be retained by the United States, and
                                        that this point be clarified in the Congressional hearings
                                        and the Joint Resolution amended accordingly. As a result of
                                        the conference this morning, Governor Edgerton is now in
                                        accord with me that, despite the special considerations
                                        which set the New Cristobal systems apart from the Panamá
                                        City and Colón systems, nevertheless the spirit and intent
                                        of the agreement between the United States and Panamá in
                                        this matter, as set forth in the May 18, 1942, exchange of
                                        notes, and reflected in the Joint Resolution introduced in
                                        the present Congress, would seem to have been to include the
                                        New Cristobal systems, and that it therefore would be
                                        inadvisable to urge on Panamá the contention that the New
                                        Cristóbal systems should be retained by <pb n="652"
                                            xml:id="pg_652" facs="0666"/>the United States. We
                                        agreed, however, that while the New Cristobal systems should
                                        be included in the transfer instrument and pass to Panamá,
                                        nevertheless an attempt should be made, when it comes to
                                        discussion of the management contract with Panamá, to make a
                                        separate arrangement covering the operation of the New
                                        Cristobal systems which would leave the operation and
                                        management of these systems entirely in the hands of The
                                        Panamá Canal. I agreed, at the Governor’s request, that at
                                        an appropriate time I would take this aspect of the matter
                                        up with the Panamanian officials and attempt to obtain their
                                        consent to it. The argument would be that, in the first
                                        place, the capital costs of these utilities in New Cristobal
                                        were not added to the capital costs of the Colón systems,
                                        and that Panamá has never been charged for amortization or
                                        interest on the New Cristobal systems. Furthermore, Panamá
                                        has never contributed to the cost of repairs and maintenance
                                        of the water and sewerage systems in New Cristobal, nor to
                                        the cost of repair and maintenance of pavements, nor to the
                                        cost of cleaning the streets and the collection of garbage
                                        in New Cristobal. The entire cost for all of these services
                                        in New Cristobal has been met by the United States, whereas
                                        in Colón and Panamá City the cost of these services has been
                                        charged against the water rates. Also the water into
                                        individual Panamá Canal quarters is not metered and it
                                        would, therefore, be impossible to bill the individual
                                        residents for the water consumed on a quantity basis. In
                                        view of the above considerations, and others brought out in
                                        Colonel Holle’s memorandum, it would be urged upon the
                                        Panamanian Government that an agreement be reached
                                        permitting The Panama Canal to continue to operate the water
                                        and sewerage systems in New Cristobal, collecting water
                                        rents from the United States employees living in that area,
                                        and applying such rates to the partial reimbursement of the
                                        cost of maintenance and repair of these systems, as well as
                                        of the maintenance and repair of pavements, and the cost of
                                        street cleaning and garbage collection. The balance of the
                                        cost of these services in New Cristobal would be met by the
                                        United States.</p>
                                    <p>I have some doubt whether Panamá will agree to the special
                                        status of the New Cristobal systems for operation purposes
                                        as outlined above. Such an arrangement might be regarded by
                                        Panamá with suspicion as an opening wedge in a renewed drive
                                        to obtain political jurisdiction for the United States over
                                        New Cristobal. The advantages, however, of such an
                                        arrangement are so obvious that they would seem to warrant
                                        an attempt to obtain Panamá’s agreement, and I shall
                                        therefore at some suitable moment broach the matter to the
                                        Panamanian authorities.</p>
                                    <p>As regards the operation of the water and sewerage systems of
                                        Colon and of Panamá City, there would be proposed to Panamá
                                        a draft management contract along the general lines of the
                                        outline set <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0667"/>forth
                                        on pages 16–19 of Colonel Holle’s memorandum. In addition,
                                        there would be stipulations in the contract for the training

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Phil</hi>: In my letter of yesterday, April
                                20,<note n="29" xml:id="d534fn29">Despatch No. 3990, not

                            trying to obtain the consent of the Panamanian Government to retention
                            by the United States of control <pb n="654" xml:id="pg_654" facs="0668"
                            />over the water and sewerage systems in New Cristobal, feeling that if
                            this can be done it will go far to remove a potentially important source
                            of friction in the future between the United States community in New
                            Cristóbal and the Panamanian authorities.</p>
                        <p>One point which has importance in connection with this matter has now
                            come up, of which I desire to inform you in order that you may be
                            posted, in the event the necessity for rapid decision and action by the
                            Department becomes necessary. In a further conversation with Dr.
                                Fábrega<note n="30" xml:id="d534fn30">Octavio Fábrega, Panamanian
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> concerning this question of the
                            special status of the water and sewerage systems in New Cristobal, he
                            mentioned that he was aware that the Panama Canal had collected in water
                            rates in the cities of Panamá and Colón during the past years a sum Over
                            and above the amount applied to expenses and to amortization and
                            interest, of some $500,000. He said that it was his understanding that
                            this sum belonged to Panamá and would be returned to Panamá at the time
                            of transfer of the water and sewerage systems. He said that this amount
                            of money, which had been collected by the Panama Canal as “excess
                            amortization” was almost equivalent to the existing unamortized balance.
                            In other words, if the United States should retain these monies it would
                            mean that Panamá had in fact paid complete amortization up to the date
                            of 1957 on the systems, and Panamá would receive no benefit from the
                            United States beyond advancing the date for transference of all of the
                            systems. He said that it had been generally understood in Panamá, and
                            this had been brought out in the hearings in Washington, that the United
                            States had desired to undertake a generous action towards Panamá as
                            regards the water and sewerage systems, and to waive the unamortized
                            balance which Panamá owed under the 1903 Treaty.<note n="31"
                                xml:id="d534fn31"><ref target="frus1904#pg_543"><hi rend="italic"
                                        >Foreign Relations</hi>, 1904, p. 543</ref>; Treaty Series
                                No. 431; 33 Stat. (pt. 2) 2234.</note> He pointed out that the rate
                            and rhythm of amortization of these systems was specified in Article VII
                            of the 1903 Treaty, which provided in effect that the United States
                            would collect water rates sufficient to amortize the principal cost of
                            the works within a period of fifty years. Any “excess” amortization over
                            and above the rate specified in the treaty, of course belonged to Panamá
                            and not to the United States. Dr. Fábrega then made the statement that
                            if Panamá were to agree that ownership of the New Cristobal water and
                            sewerage systems should not pass to Panamá but should be retained by the
                            United States, this would be more readily acceptable and understood by
                            Panamanian opinion if it were known that Panamá was in fact receiving
                            the benefit of waiver by the United States of the unamortized balance on
                            the Colón and Panamá City systems. If, on the other hand, the United
                            States should in effect pay itself as of the date of transfer of the
                            systems the <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0669"/>total amount of
                            amortization, contrary to the expectations of Panamá, then it would be
                            very difficult to understand why Panamá should be called upon to agree
                            that the New Cristobal systems should remain in the hands of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Immediately after my conversation with Dr. Fábrega I spoke with Governor
                            Edgerton, who confirmed to me that the Panama Canal had in fact
                            collected a sum considerably in excess of the $500,000 mentioned by Dr.
                            Fábrega from the water rates over and above the amount which had been
                            applied to amortization. In fact, the Governor said that there was on
                            hand today an excess sum of monies collected in water rates which almost
                            equalled the unamortized balance. Governor Edgerton said that he
                            believed there had been a phrase included in the exchange of notes of
                            May 18, 1942, relating to the accounts for the water works and which
                            provided in effect that the books would be closed as of date of transfer
                            of ownership with no refund to Panamá. We looked up the phraseology in
                            the exchange of notes and found the sentence reading: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It is understood that there will be no refund to Panamá of
                                    amortization and interest payments or charges of any kind based
                                    on the Convention of 1903 and on the contracts of September 30,
                                    1910.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It appears, however, that this excess amount collected by the Panama
                            Canal was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> applied to amortization or
                            interest, but has been held out as a separate fund. It has not been paid
                            into the Treasury as general receipts, and is still available for
                            disbursement by the Panamá Canal, although the Governor believes that
                            the consent of the Comptroller General would have to be obtained to pay
                            it out.</p>
                        <p>The Governor states that the contracts of September 30, 1910 provided
                            that water rates collected in excess of the treaty rate of amortization
                            could be applied to additional amortization. In fact, however, the
                            excess monies collected were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> so applied, but
                            have been retained, as stated above, as a separate fund.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances, it seems to me clear as a matter of good faith
                            and fair dealing with Panamá, that this sum collected by the United
                            States from the water rates in Panamá over and above the treaty rate of
                            amortization, and which has not been applied to amortization, should be
                            returned to Panamá at the time of transfer of the water and sewerage
                            systems. In fact, I think there can be no doubt, as I am at present
                            advised, that this sum of money belongs to Panamá and always has
                            belonged to Panamá and that there can be no justification for its
                            retention by the United States. Certainly it has been contemplated
                            throughout this negotiation concerning the transfer of the water and
                            sewerage systems, and this is brought out from the hearings on the
                            legislation in Washington, that the United States intended to forgive to
                            Panamá the unamortized balance of approximately <pb n="656"
                                xml:id="pg_656" facs="0670"/>$800,000. For the United States now to
                            seek to appropriate to itself a sum belonging to Panamá approximately
                            equal to this unamortized balance, and therefore in effect to make no
                            waiver whatsoever of the unamortized balance would be contrary to the
                            spirit and to the letter of what the United States and Panamá have
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p>Futhermore, and quite apart from the considerations of right and good
                            faith involved, it is quite obvious that if we should seek to retain
                            this sum of money belonging to Panamá, there would be no possibility
                            whatsoever of obtaining Panamá’s consent to continuing ownership by the
                            United States of the New Cristóbal water and sewerage systems. This
                            latter point is of utmost importance, in my judgment, and, apart from
                            all other considerations, we should make every effort to continue this
                            ownership.</p>
                        <p>It may be that, during future conversations with the President and the
                            Foreign Minister, the question may be raised definitely in the form that
                            Panamá will agree to continue United States ownership of the New
                            Cristobal systems provided it is clearly understood that no obstacles
                            will be placed in the way of return to Panamá of the excess amount
                            collected in water rates. In such case I may have to telegraph the
                            Department and urge an early and definite reply, and it is with this in
                            mind that I am outlining this question so that you may be giving
                            consideration to it.</p>
                        <p>With all best wishes,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Ambassador</hi>: I refer to your letter
                            of April 21, 1943 relative to the retention by the United States of
                            control over the water and sewerage systems in New Cristóbal and
                            particularly to that part of your discussion regarding the disposition
                            of the net surplus of approximately $500,000 resulting from water
                            revenue collections in the Republic of Panama. You state that this money
                            is being held by the Canal Zone authorities in a separate fund. Upon the
                            receipt of your letter I asked Mr. Wise<note n="32" xml:id="d535fn32"
                                >Murray M. Wise, Division of the American Republics.</note> to make
                            a study of the question of the surplus revenues. Attached for your
                            information is a copy of a memorandum dated May 1, 1943<note n="33"
                                xml:id="d535fn33">Not printed; Mr. Wise concluded that the United
                                States should not turn oyer the fund to Panama.</note> prepared by
                            him as a result of his investigation and discussion with the Legal
                            Adviser’s office.</p>
                        <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0671"/>
                        <p>It is my recollection that in choosing the phraseology for that part of
                            the Department’s note of May 18, 1942 relating to the accounts for the
                            water works, this Government intended to avoid the possibility of being
                            called upon to make any cash refund whatever to Panama as well as to
                            avoid any controversy with Panamá regarding our bookkeeping. You will
                            recall from the minutes describing the meetings between the Under
                            Secretary and the Panamanian Foreign Minister in Washington during the
                            summer of 1941,<note n="34" xml:id="d535fn34">For correspondence
                                concerning these meetings, see <ref target="frus1941v07#pg_442"><hi

                            latter indicated that he had some misgivings about our system of
                            accounts. We have of course no commitment whatever to Panama relative to
                            the amount of the value of the unamortized balance of the water
                            works.</p>
                        <p>It is my opinion that it would be a mistake to turn this $500,000 over to
                            the Government of Panama even if it were legally possible to do so.
                            Instead, since this sum was collected from users of water, I think it
                            should be expended for their benefit. Perhaps the management contract
                            now under consideration locally could include a provision regarding
                            expenditures to be undertaken by us from the amount in question. I
                            definitely feel that this sum should neither be devoted to the general
                            purposes of the Government of the United States, nor to the general
                            purposes of the Government of Panama, but should be spent in some way
                            which would directly benefit the consumers of water in both Colon and
                            the City of Panama.</p>
                        <p>I hope that the above will meet with your approval and that you will
                            endeavor to bring the Panamanian authorities around to this point of
                            view.</p>
                        <p>With best regards,</p>

                            correspondence regarding the disposition of the net surplus resulting
                            from the water revenue collections in the Republic of Panama and
                            acknowledge the receipt of your letter of May 7, 1943, with its enclosed
                            copy of a communication, dated May 4, from Governor Edgerton to
                                you.<note n="35" xml:id="d536fn35">Neither printed.</note> I note
                            that the surplus is considerably larger than we had thought; namely,
                            some $900,000 rather than $500,000. I feel, and believe that you agree
                            with me, that it would be highly undesirable for us to engage <pb
                                n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0672"/>in any discussion whatsoever
                            with the Panamanian Government relative to the amount of this
                            surplus.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately, Governor Edgerton is not strongly advocating that the
                            remaining unamortized capital cost of some $824,000 be liquidated from
                            the existing surplus for I concur fully with you that this would not be
                            the proper method of disposing of these funds In presenting the
                            legislation to the Congress it was made perfectly clear that the
                            enactment of the bill would relieve Panama of all further obligation of
                            amortization and interest payments. The House and Senate were never led
                            to believe that the unamortized value would be collected in any way from
                            Panama. It was contemplated that the legislation would wipe out all
                            Panamanian indebtedness, in so far as the water and sewerage
                            installations were concerned.</p>
                        <p>I was glad to note your reaction to my suggestion that this surplus fund
                            should be expended for the benefit of the users of water from whom the
                            monies were originally collected. I did not wish to imply, however, that
                            this fund should be applied to the cost of operation of the water and
                            sewerage systems, or to garbage disposal in the cities of Panama and
                            Colon. In fact, I feel strongly that the surplus water fund should be
                            used only for capital purposes.</p>
                        <p>I have examined again our files and find that in a memorandum of March
                            20, 1942<note n="36" xml:id="d536fn36">Not printed.</note> Dr. Stayer,
                            Chief Health Officer of The Panama Canal, pointed out the following to
                            Governor Edgerton with respect to the current condition of the water and
                            sewerage systems: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The aqueducts of both sewerage and water systems are old, the
                                    terra cotta of the sewers has resulted in seepage, and the
                                    corrosion of the water pipes is such that renewals in the near
                                    future will be required at considerable expense. It is not
                                    beyond some doubt that such deteriorated materials would lead to
                                    cross-infection from sewers to water system and since any
                                    cross-contamination would be a health hazard to Canal Zone
                                    residents as well as residents of Panama, it is best to keep
                                    control of the entire systems. The cost of replacing worn
                                    aqueducts would be prohibitive from the Republic of Panama
                                    standpoint.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>As you know and have pointed out to the Department so many times, it is
                            very necessary that these installations be kept in good repair in order
                            to avoid unsanitary conditions in such a vital and strategic area of the
                            Isthmus. Obviously, the Panamanians are not able either financially or
                            technically to make the repairs which are needed. Since the application
                            to repairs on the water and sewerage systems of the surplus under
                            discussion would apparently relieve Panama of appreciable expenditures
                            in the very near future I am inclined to feel that it will not be
                            difficult to obtain complete agreement from the interested parties
                            regarding this use of the surplus fund.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Phil</hi>: I acknowledge receipt of your letter
                            of May 17, 1943, in further reference to the disposition of the surplus
                            collected from the water rates in the Republic of Panamá.</p>
                        <p>I am glad to note that you are of the opinion that it would not be the
                            proper method of disposing of these funds to use them to liquidate the
                            remaining unamortized capital cost of the systems from this existing
                            surplus.</p>
                        <p>I also note that you feel strongly that this surplus water fund should be
                            used only for capital purposes. In this connection you will have seen
                            from my letter of May 19,<note n="37" xml:id="d537fn37">Not
                                printed.</note> which crossed your letter of May 17, that I had
                            already adopted the idea of devoting the surplus to needed repairs of
                            the systems, and that I had made a suggestion in this sense both to
                            President de la Guardia and to Dr. Fábrega.</p>
                        <p>Governor Edgerton tells me that without having made a detailed estimate
                            of the cost of repairs required by the systems and which have been
                            deferred during the emergency, he believes that the cost would be
                            between $200,000 and $300,000, certainly not beyond the latter figure.
                            He mentioned that as a matter of fact the amounts spent on repairs of
                            the systems during the emergency compare rather favorably with amounts
                            spent for similar purposes prior to the emergency. Nevertheless, he
                            believes that up to $300,000 could be well spent on additional repairs
                            to the systems. Inasmuch as the surplus is now something over $900,000,
                            and is being increased at the rate of about $25,000 a month, this would
                            mean that with the earmarking of $300,000 for repairs we would still
                            have a surplus at the time we transfer the systems to Panamá of close to
                            $700,000. Governor Edgerton also informs me that expenditures on capital
                            cost account of the water systems should be made in the residential
                            section of Panamá City beyond Bella Vista, where the Panamanian
                            Government installed water pipes too small in size to provide adequate
                            pressure. This residential section has been developed considerably of
                            late and will <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0674"/>receive much
                            greater development in the post-war period, and Governor Edgerton
                            believes it would be desirable to install additional water pipes in
                            order that that section may be properly serviced. We do not know as yet
                            what the estimated cost of such installation would be and presumably it
                            would still leave a balance available for capital purposes from the
                            surplus.</p>

                        <p>Governor Edgerton and I called today by appointment on the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs and handed him for his consideration the attached draft
                            of instrument of transfer to Panamá of the water and sewerage systems in
                            the cities of Panamá and Colón and agreement respecting incidental and
                            related matters (this draft is copied from the fourth draft enclosed
                            with Governor Edgerton’s letter to me of July 7, 1943).<note n="39"

                                its enclosures (memorandum of Acting General Counsel, dated June 16,
                                1943, and two drafts of instruments of transfer) were transmitted to
                                the Department by the Ambassador in Panama in his despatch No. 4349
                                of July 15; none printed.</note></p>
                        <p>We explained at the outset that this draft was prepared on the basis of
                            transferring only the systems in the cities of Panamá and Colón, and
                            retention by the United States of the New Cristobal systems. In this
                            connection I referred to the various conferences I had had with the
                            President and the Foreign Minister at which I had explained the reasons
                            which made this appear advisable, and to conversations which Governor
                            Edgerton also had had with the President on this subject. Dr. Fábrega
                            said that he recalled that we had discussed alternative ways of handling
                            this matter, one being a transfer to Panamá of the New Cristobal systems
                            as well but with provision in the transfer instrument for continued
                            operation and maintenance by the United States, the United States to
                            assume all cost of such operation and maintenance and Panamá agreeing
                            not to charge the United States for the water consumed in that area. He
                            said that he preferred an arrangement along this line rather than that
                            proposed in our draft, which provided for continued ownership by the
                            United States of the <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0675"/>New
                            Cristobal systems. He said, however, that he would study the draft and
                            would lay it before the Panamanian Government for consideration,
                            advising us as soon as possible of the Government’s views in the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>With reference to paragraph 4 of the draft, Dr. Fábrega pointed out that
                            the United States presumably would continue not only to maintain and
                            repair the pavements in New Cristobal, but also to provide for garbage
                            collection and street cleaning. We agreed to this—the omission of
                            reference to these matters had taken place inadvertently in preparing
                            the draft.</p>
                        <p>As regards the disposition of the surplus funds (paragraph 5 of the
                            draft), we had some discussion. We went over familiar ground discussed
                            in past conferences, Dr. Fábrega stating that it was his belief that the
                            phraseology employed in the exchange of notes of May 18, 1943 [<hi
                                rend="italic">1942</hi>], had protected the right of the Panamanian
                            Government to receive the surplus funds, and I pointing out the view of
                            the State Department that the phraseology of the exchange of notes
                            definitely relieved the Government of the United States of making any
                            refund to Panamá. Dr. Fábrega said that he would appreciate having in
                            writing a statement of the views of the Department of State so that such
                            views could be considered by the Panamanian Government. I said that I
                            would be glad to put these views in writing and send them to him.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that Dr. Fábrega would let us know when he was in a
                            position to discuss these questions further.</p>

                                    Government of the United States undertake to change the said
                                    station to a spot within the Canal Zone, or under Panamanian
                                    jurisdiction, as the Republic of Panama may decide at the time.

                            project would be undertaken. However, as you are aware, and as Governor
                            Edgerton has rightly pointed out to the Panamanian authorities, this
                            Government has considered the removal of the railroad terminal as an
                            undertaking for the future and as a matter not in any way connected with
                            the transfer to Panama under the provisions of recent legislation of
                            lands not needed for railroad purposes. This Department feels that the

                            being used for railroad purposes, was contemplated. In fact, the
                            documents show that the lots covered by the railroad station and yards
                            were marked “Property necessary for railroad business.”</p>

                            the present emergency the location of the railroad station and yards.
                            Furthermore, until a prudent interval has elapsed after the opening of
                            the Trans-Isthmian and Inter-American Highways, <pb n="664"
                                xml:id="pg_664" facs="0678"/>it would seem almost impossible for the
                            Canal Zone authorities to determine the exact requirements under normal
                            peace-time conditions of the Panama Railroad Company for its terminal
                            facilities on the Pacific side of the Isthmus. Then too, there is always
                            the possibility that development in air transportation following the end
                            of the present war may considerably affect the passenger and freight
                            business of the Railroad.</p>
                        <p>In view of these circumstances this Department is definitely of the
                            opinion that there is no possibility during the present emergency of
                            complying with the Panamanian request for the change in location of the
                            terminal facilities of the Panama Railroad Company in Panama City. For
                            your own information the Department considers that it is highly
                            ill-advised of the Panamanian authorities to raise this issue again at
                            this time. Accordingly, at an early opportunity you are requested to
                            discuss the Department’s attitude on this question with the Governor of
                            The Panama Canal and thereafter, in his company, you are requested to
                            make this Government’s position unmistakably clear to the appropriate
                            officials of the Panamanian Government.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Jiménez called at the Department this morning to discuss
                            matters relating to the removal of the terminal facilities of the Panama
                            Railroad Company from their present site to a new location in Panamá
                            City. He referred to this Government’s commitment, as recorded under
                            Point 10 of the Memorandum of May 18, 1942, to move the station, yards,
                            and appurtenances. The Ambassador called attention to that Section of
                            United States Public Law No. 48, 78th Congress, approved May 3, 1943,
                            which provides that the authority to convey to Panama the lands of the
                            Panamá Railroad Company “… shall not be exercised after June 30, 1944”
                            and, in that connection, stated that the President of Panama had asked
                            him to discuss with the Department the possibility of taking some action
                            now to earmark for transfer to Panama those lands which are at present
                            being used for railroad terminal facilities in Panamá City. (It will be
                            recalled that recently the Panamanian Government raised the question of
                            removing <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0679"/>the railroad station
                            and yards to a new site and that the Department instructed Ambassador
                            Wilson to inform the Panamanian authorities that there would be no
                            possibility during the present emergency of complying with the
                            Panamanian request.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bonsal explained to the Ambassador that in considering what lands
                            were to be transferred to Panamá under the provisions of Public Law No.
                            48, the Secretary of War had designated the lots occupied as railroad
                            terminal facilities in Panama City as necessary for railroad business.
                            (In seeking the authority of the Congress for the transfer of the
                            railroad property, as provided for in Public Law No. 48, it was clearly
                            shown in the documents and maps that the lots covered by the railroad
                            station, yards, and appurtenances were to be retained by this
                            Government.) He pointed out that in view of these circumstances there is
                            no authority under the terms of Public Law No. 48 for the transfer of
                            the railroad station lots. Mr. Bonsai then stated that it was his
                            definite opinion that should the Secretary of War find that these lots
                            were unnecessary for railroad purposes (in the event that a new site
                            were made available by the Panamanian Government and deemed by both
                            Governments to be suitable) the Executive Branch of this Government
                            would necessarily have to seek Congressional approval for their free
                            transfer to Panama.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bonsal took this occasion to point out to Ambassador Jiménez that
                            neither this Government nor the Government of Panama could justifiably
                            contemplate at this time the disruption of railroad traffic and freight
                            handling or the diversion of critical materials needed for the war
                            effort to the construction of a new railroad station and facilities. Mr.
                            Bonsal informed the Ambassador of his opinion that this Government would
                            wish to consider the moving of the railroad station as a part of a
                            general program of civic improvement which would affect property owners
                            other than the Railroad Company. In making these statements Mr. Bonsai
                            left the definite impression that under no circumstances could this
                            Government consider the moving of the railroad station to a new site
                            during the present emergency and that it was his opinion that the whole
                            question of the removal of the station and the disposition of the land
                            occupied by it was not a matter for further current negotiation.</p>

                        <p>Upon the Ambassador’s withdrawal, Mr. Bonsal stated that it was his own
                            personal opinion that the policy of this Government, as indicated by the
                            enactment of Public Law No. 48, would seem to be to transfer to the
                            Republic of Panama without charge real estate in the cities of Panamá
                            and Colón, now occupied by the Panama Railroad or by other agencies of
                            this Government, which may at some future time be found no longer
                            necessary for the operation of the railroad or for <pb n="666"
                                xml:id="pg_666" facs="0680"/>the operation, maintenance, sanitation,
                            or protection of the Canal. However, in accordance with the terms of
                            Public Law No. 48, he believed new Congressional authority would be
                            required for each such transfer.</p>

                            clearly stated to the Panamanian Foreign Minister this Government’s
                            position with respect to a change in the site of the Panama railroad
                            station and yards. Dr. Fábrega says he cannot see why these particular
                            lots should not be included in the deed of conveyance now under
                            preparation. He explained that his government was not especially
                            interested in seeing the station moved at this time but that it was
                            feared that unless the station lots were included in the present deed,
                            the whole question of their transfer at some future time would have to
                            be taken up with our Congress. Amb. Wilson said his instructions
                            definitely disposed of that point by emphatically stating that any
                            transfer of these lands would require Congressional approval.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said he would report our position to the President. Speaking
                            laughingly he said the Panamanians were obstinate negotiators and
                            probably would insist on their point of view. The Ambassador said he was
                            aware of Panamanian obstinacy but hoped that the Minister would advise
                            the President that the U.S. Gov’t had spoken definitively.</p>

                        <p>A–1527. Reference your despatch no. 4570 of September 1, 1943.<note
                                n="48" xml:id="d543fn48">Not printed.</note> The Department’s note
                            of May 18, 1942, to the Panamanian Government stated that in
                            transferring the water works and sewerage systems it was to be
                            understood that there would be “no refund to Panama <pb n="667"
                                xml:id="pg_667" facs="0681"/>of amortization and interest payments
                                <hi rend="underline">or charges of any kind based on the Convention

                            (Underlining supplied)</p>
                        <p>The Department believes that the underlined phraseology has only one
                            legal interpretation; namely, that this Government is in no way
                            committed to return to Panama the surplus water rates collected and now
                            being held by The Panama Canal. Furthermore, the Department agrees with
                            Governor Edgerton that The Panama Canal will need statutory authority to
                            expend the surplus funds on repairs or necessary extensions of the water
                            and sewerage systems in the cities of Panamá and Colón. Accordingly, the
                            Department believes that the Panamanian contention, as set forth in the
                            memorandum forwarded with the despatch referred to above, should not be
                            accepted, but that you and Governor Edgerton should definitely maintain
                            the position which you have already taken before the Panamanian
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>In connection with other points raised by Dr. Fábrega in the memorandum,
                            the Department is interested in knowing whether a draft management
                            contract has been prepared (your telegram 411 of August 3) and whether
                            it is contemplated that the management contract will be signed
                            simultaneously with the signing of the instrument of transfer.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Wilson and Governor Edgerton have conferred further with the
                            Panamanian Foreign Minister concerning the draft instrument designed to
                            transfer the water and sewerage systems. Dr. Fábrega insists that his
                            Government cannot understand our view regarding the “surplus” funds and
                            that a formal note will be sent the State Department through the
                            Panamanian Embassy at Washington setting forth the Panamanian point of
                            view. Ambassador Wilson assured him that the United States Government
                            would maintain its position.</p>
                        <p>Governor Edgerton told Dr. Fábrega that there was no question in his mind
                            that the spirit and intent of the exchange of notes of May 18, 1942 and
                            of Public Law 48 provided for the transfer to Panama of the New
                            Cristóbal systems, but that, as a practical matter, he felt it <pb

                            particularly since it would be difficult for him to expend United States
                            Government funds on the New Cristóbal systems once they had passed out
                            of ownership of the United States, if such ownership could, in fact, be
                            retained provisionally by the United States. Dr. Fábrega said this had
                            been carefully considered by the Panamanian Cabinet which had decided
                            that the New Cristobal systems should pass to Panama as intended by both
                            Governments. Ambassador Wilson pointed out that he could find nothing in
                            the Panamanian Constitution which would oblige the Panamanian Government
                            to limit an operation contract to a period of twenty years.</p>
                        <p>Governor Edgerton feels that the Panamanian figures relative to a 7½ cent
                            instead of a 9 cent water rate, are not convincing.</p>
                        <p>A further meeting with the Foreign Minister is contemplated and in the
                            meantime Governor Edgerton is preparing an informal memorandum setting

                                Panama City</hi></p>
                        <p>I had a talk with Governor Edgerton this afternoon regarding the above
                            subject. He stated that of course the Railroad could not consider moving
                            the station during the emergency, but added that if he were properly
                            approached by the Panamanians he would be glad to proceed with a survey
                            of the proposed site. He said the cost of the survey will run into
                            several thousand dollars, a sum which the Railroad Company will pay if
                            it is finally decided that this is not a cost which can justifiably be
                            charged to the Panamanians. He said that he would resent very much a
                            request asking for a survey of the site at our expense, since he prefers
                            offering to pay the cost only after he has asked the Panamanians to do
                            so and has been told that they desire to avoid this expenditure. In
                            other words, he wants the Panamanians to feel that our paying this cost
                            is not an obligation, but rather wants it to be considered as another
                            definite gesture or concession on the part of this Government. This puts
                            the Governor in a better light and may better his bargaining position on
                            some other phase of this negotiation.</p>
                        <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0683"/>
                        <p>The Governor states that he believes that the site being offered by the
                            Panamanians is a good one and is acceptable when considered in relation
                            to the Trans-Isthmian Highway, the Inter-American Highway and the
                            international airlines. He believes that if the survey turns out as he
                            believes it will, we can say to the Panamanians that the site will be
                            acceptable if properly prepared (improved) by the Panamanians at their
                            expense. This preparation will include filling, grading, building proper
                            approaches (streets), and installing water and sewer facilities. The
                            Governor further believes that negotiations can then be entered into for
                            the purpose of determining the conditions which will control the
                            transfer when it is made after the war. These details, among others,
                            will include disposition of the land now occupied and the sale of the
                            buildings on the present site.</p>
                        <p>I believe the foregoing is more or less what Mr. Duggan had in mind. The
                            Governor believes that if we are approached again by the Panamanians we
                            should state that these decisions rest principally with the Canal Zone
                            authorities and that they should be approached through our Embassy at
                            Panama. In other words the Governor feels that the “ball” is down there.
                            The Governor expects Dr. Fábrega to get in touch with him again after he
                            has discussed the matter fully with the Panamanian Minister of
                            Finance.</p>

                            of this Embassy, respecting Axis organizations in Paraguay, from which
                            it appears that the Paraguayan Ministry of the Interior proposes to
                            place an interventor in each German and Italian association or similar
                            entity in Asunción.</p>
                        <p>The salary of 10,000 Paraguayan pesos per month which each association
                            will be forced to pay to the interventor, while it may seem small, is
                            quite likely to result in the dissolution of a number of the
                            organizations listed, as they are now financially in poor shape. In any
                            event the new measure is calculated to be most helpful.</p>

                            armed forces has been favorable. Combined with American success in North
                            Africa and Allied military victories on other fronts, the arms shipments
                            have probably constituted a prime factor in an increasingly noticeable
                            shift of opinion in military circles in favor of the United States.</p>
                        <p>With the exception of a very few officers, military circles under the
                                Morinigo<note n="4" xml:id="d547fn4">President Higínio
                                Morínigo.</note> regime have not been friendly to the United States,
                            and the powerful cavalry division stationed near the capital has been at
                            times actively, and always passively, hostile. It was therefore in these
                            circles that disappointment may have lurked at the failure of delivering
                            the Lend-Lease arms promised to Paraguay. This delay was pointed to as
                            evidence of the various faults attributed to the United States, and
                            therefore served to keep alive pro-Axis and anti-American
                            sentiments.</p>
                        <p>Because there were many army and navy officers (in active service) who
                            were convinced that arms were unlikely to arrive from the United States,
                            the actual delivery of the first two shipments had a strong effect.
                            Searching for some means of softening this certain persons began saying,
                            after the news of the contents of the first shipment became known—that
                            the sending of trucks instead of guns revealed the duplicity of the
                            United States. As reported in my despatch No. 618, of December 15,
                                1942,<note n="5" xml:id="d547fn5">Not printed.</note> the Argentine
                            Embassy here was alleged to have encouraged the circulation of a rumor
                            to the above effect.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, after the impact of the news of the first shipment, opinion
                            in official and private circles began to reflect satisfaction over the
                            fact itself. When the second shipment was delivered a few weeks later, a
                            definite change in opinion toward the United States materialized in
                            military circles. Even the Cavalry Division Chief began to bestow social
                            and other attentions on this Embassy. Finally, about a week ago, a
                            prominent naval officer (noted for his aversion to definite statements
                            of fact or opinion, especially on international and political matters)
                            made a clear-cut, emphatic statement to Third Secretary Henderson. Its
                            substance was that this naval officer, who declared that he could speak
                            for the leaders of the armed forces, stated that the arrival of two
                            shipments of Lend-Lease material spoke louder than any words or
                            promises, and removed the last vestige of doubt as to our sincerity;
                            that the armed forces were genuinely impressed and even contrite over
                            their former suspicions; that these shipments had done more than
                            anything else to bolster friendship for us; and that he was frankly
                            amazed that the United States had “come through <pb n="672"
                                xml:id="pg_672" facs="0686"/>with the goods” in spite of Paraguay’s

                        <p>Events on world battlefronts have naturally contributed much toward
                            creating a propitious setting for the apparent change in sentiment
                            outlined above. American victories in North Africa and the Pacific, as
                            well as military successes of other United Nations, have finally made
                            Paraguayan Nazi sympathizers realize that the Axis’ winning streak has
                            come to an end, and that the United States in particular has now brought
                            into effective play its tremendous potential might. Hitler’s star has
                            consequently fallen measurably, especially among the military.</p>
                        <p>The sudden show of cordiality toward the United States may also reflect
                            the intense fear and hatred Paraguayans feel for Communism and which may
                            impel them to magnify the role of the United States in the war in an
                            attempt to overlook Russian victories.</p>

                        <p>85. For Under Secretary. President sent for me this morning to sound out
                            possibility of loan or aid to build hangars for planes and storehouses
                            for other Lend-Lease material, estimating cost at $185,000, and
                            stressing that inquiry was personal and tentative. I ventured suggestion
                            that such a request might make poor impression at Washington in view of
                            very special Lend-Lease terms<note n="7" xml:id="d548fn7">Presumably
                                this refers to the articles under which Paraguay was obligated to
                                repay $300,000 of the $11,000,000 authorized for defense articles
                                for Paraguay.</note> for this country and in view of fact that
                            economies of 3% in regular Paraguayan budget would yield sum indicated.
                            President said half heartedly that doubtless I was right. Interview was
                            cordial.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 797 of February 17, 1943 (File No. 800), which enclosed a
                            communication denouncing <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0687"
                            />American cooperation with the Morínigo Government and indicating that
                            no return cooperation has been secured.<note n="8" xml:id="d549fn8"
                                >Neither printed; the enclosed communication was anonymous. It
                                expressed the resentment of opponents of Morinigo that the aid given
                                by the United States to his Government strengthened the dictatorship
                                (711.34/32).</note> In this connection it may be reported that
                            certain American and other friends of democracy residing in Asunción and
                            cities in neighboring countries are known to feel that the Morínigo
                            régime has not adopted measures or attitudes which justify the aid it
                            has received. As the Department is aware the majority of the educated
                            Paraguayans who favor the Allied cause, both in Asunción and Buenos
                            Aires, are hostile to President Morínigo; so that Americans resident in
                            both cities find themselves in contact with criticism of the present
                            Government of this country as being essentially uncooperative and
                            anti-democratic. The Department will also recall that some three months
                            ago, in Despatch No. 597, of December 9, 1942,<note n="9"
                                xml:id="d549fn9">Not printed.</note> there was treated the absence
                            of helpfulness in official quarters here on local matters relating to
                            the war effort.</p>
                        <p>At the present time, fortunately, it may be said that recent favorable
                            actions have shown that previous such actions were in reality parts of a
                            considered policy of cooperation which is now plainly in full
                            development. In despatch No. 810, of February 20, 1943,<note n="9"
                                xml:id="d549fn10">Not printed.</note> a succinct list was supplied
                            of twenty helpful steps taken by the Morínigo Government, under the
                            guidance of Dr. Argaña,<note n="10" xml:id="d549fn11">Luis A. Argana,
                                Paraguayan Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> beginning last
                            September. Since the despatch was prepared this Government has (1)
                            issued a most cordial invitation to Vice President Wallace to pay an
                            official visit to Asunción,<note n="11" xml:id="d549fn12">For

                            agents of the Axis powers. While any mercantile calculation as to
                            exactly the amount of “aid” given on the one hand and “cooperation”
                            returned on the other would be invidious and ridiculous, it may
                            assuredly be said that the Morínigo-Argaña régime has now afforded much
                            collaboration.</p>
                        <p>I am impelled, further, to mention this Embassy’s increasing
                            comprehension of, and admiration for, the courage shown by Paraguay’s
                            rupture of relations with the Axis.<note n="13" xml:id="d549fn14"

                            régime <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0688"/>faced in forming and
                            putting through this decision have become more apparent as our knowledge
                            of the situation has grown, (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Our sustained and
                            detailed investigations and attempts at action in connection with the
                            Proclaimed List have revealed the strength and ramifications of the
                            German and Italian economic elements here. It cannot be too strongly
                            emphasized that a majority of the commerce and industries have been in
                            German and Italian hands, in this capital city of Paraguay. The
                            international public is familiar with the existence of large German
                            groups in the south of Chile and the south of Brazil, but these groups
                            are not actually omnipresent <hi rend="italic">in the capitals</hi> of
                            the countries in question. The percentage of Germans and Italians and
                            Paraguayans of German and Italian blood in and around Asunción is, I
                            firmly believe, much higher than in any South American center of
                            government. (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) In the second place the influence
                            of Argentina is phenomenally strong in Paraguay. As pointed out
                            recently, no country in the hemisphere has been so completely at the
                            mercy of any other country as Paraguay at that of Argentina. Every step
                            taken by Dr. Argaña in international affairs must be appraised in the
                            light of the Argentine influences here. When critics dismiss Paraguay’s
                            anti-Axis stand as meriting scant appreciation they ignore the
                            ubiquitous German-Italian strength here and the crushing pressure from
                            Argentina. Perhaps no one of the nineteen republics needed the fortitude
                            and resolution which this republic did in taking the step.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a discussion of the Paraguayan internal situation.] I also
                            wish to make the point that General Morínigo’s decision, adopted with
                            great firmness a few weeks prior to the Rio Conference, and the
                            subsequent pro-Ally steps taken by his Government have been largely due
                            to the influence of Dr. Argaña. I was told again this week, as coming
                            from the head of an English firm whose lawyer Dr. Argaña has been for
                            many years, the same story which Dr. Argaña himself told me twenty
                            months ago, namely that his attitude with regard to the war is based on
                            his religious convictions. Certain of the Nazi doctrines and acts
                            profoundly shocked his devout views, and his faith in Divine Providence
                            led him to the conclusion that it would not permit the triumph of the
                            barbarous and anti-Christian Nazi forces. I believe this is in very
                            truth his attitude; and I question whether any Foreign Minister named by
                            a Liberal or other <hi rend="italic">soi-disant</hi> pro-democratic
                            government would have a stronger or more ineradicable determination to
                            further the victory of the United Nations than that with which he is
                            imbued.</p>

                        <p>A–171. Your despatch no. 799, February 18.<note n="15" xml:id="d550fn15"
                                >Not printed.</note> Department has considered carefully the matter
                            of supplying publicity in the German language in Paraguay, realizing
                            that the presence of large numbers of German-speaking families in the
                            Encarnación and Villarrica regions presents a special circumstance.</p>
                        <p>Similar problems regarding publicity for foreign-language groups have
                            arisen in various other American republics. However, the Department has
                            opposed the distribution of material under United States Government
                            auspices in languages other than English or that of the republic
                            concerned. For one reason, it is desired to avoid any suggestion of a
                            United States Government appeal to racial or linguistic groups within a
                            republic over the head of the national government involved. This general
                            policy has been preserved even in cases such as that reported by the
                            Embassy, where the government involved seems to have no objection.</p>
                        <p>The Department would have no objection, however, to supplying a
                            pro-democratic German-language publication with copies of our regular
                            publicity material for its translation and use, should such a paper be
                            authorized and established in Paraguay.</p>

                            former, a Paraguayan citizen, asked a high ranking official of the

                            directly that he [was?] to accompany and open edifice for party. He did
                            not feel like protesting and accordingly complied. Parenthetically
                            nothing suspicious was found except few copies German-Argentine
                            propaganda “hechos.”</p>
                        <p>Above action was taken without consulting Naval Attaché<note n="21"
                                xml:id="d551fn21">Comdr. Peyton H. Park.</note> or while Ministry of
                            the Interior official did not consult his Minister, or Foreign Office.
                            Case was clearly one of zeal by all the young men concerned none of whom
                            has any considerable experience abroad. As entry seemed to constitute
                            grave infraction of rights of Spain as protecting power and might be
                            used by Germany to justify reprisals in kind, I called on Spanish Vice
                            Consul following morning to inform him that my subordinates had acted
                            without my knowledge or authorization and to suggest matter be kept
                            confidential pending Spanish Minister’s return. He had already
                            telegraphed Minister but otherwise refrained from complaint.</p>
                        <p>Minister returned March 20 and met me at social function. He took matter
                            up at once and I reiterated my regrets. His attitude was correct and he
                            professed desires to avoid likelihood of major incident but he felt that
                            his position necessitated some action. At his suggestion I called upon
                            him Monday morning and found he had already visited Foreign Minister to
                            lodge protest and had drafted cable to Madrid. On ground of newspapers
                            avoiding unpleasantness Paraguayan Government, I induced him not to
                            prepare the formal note to Foreign Office which Foreign Minister had
                            suggested. He also undertook to endeavor if possible to see that
                            incident should not come to attention of Berlin. He stated his telegram
                            to his Government was merely to recite facts and would suggest no
                            drastic steps be taken. Considering danger to his own standing, his
                            attitude has seemed definitely helpful and cooperative.</p>
                        <p>There is reasonable prospect that difficulties will be avoided but
                            present report is to place Department <hi rend="italic">au courant</hi>
                            against contingencies. Our defense if necessary could be that Paraguayan
                            Government is responsible for its acts and I may mention that Foreign
                            Minister indicated to Spanish Minister that Spanish Vice Consul should
                            have protested before opening edifice.</p>
                        <p>Department’s comments and guidance by telegram would be much
                            appreciated.</p>

                            Naval Attaché have been reprimanded for acting improperly and without

                            has communicated this incident to Berlin.</p>

                            incident should be submitted to the Department by telegram.<note n="22"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to request the
                            Department’s advice as to the procedure the Proclaimed List section of
                            the Embassy should follow and the attitude it should adopt toward the
                            local press in view of its acceptance of advertisements for Proclaimed
                            List firms.</p>
                        <p>The Department is aware of the fact that some time ago the local press
                            was at best neutral in its policy toward the Axis but that there has
                            been a decided change in its outlook, particularly during the last <pb
                                n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0692"/>year. The Embassy’s efforts in
                            this direction have been eminently successful; although at times more
                            positive cooperation could be asked for the situation on the whole is
                            gratifying. (See Embassy Strictly Confidential Despatch 1160 of July 8,
                                1943,<note n="23" xml:id="d553fn23">Not printed.</note> “Report on
                            the Daily Press in Asunción. Marked Change in the Attitude of <hi
                                rend="italic">El Paraguayo</hi> Recently”, in connection with the
                            editorial policy of the local press).</p>
                        <p>With the exception of one, <hi rend="italic">El Pais</hi>, all of the
                            local newspapers, however, have consistently carried advertisements for
                            Proclaimed List firms. The Proclaimed List section of the Embassy has
                            not taken any steps to discourage or prevent the local newspapers from
                            accepting such advertisements. The Embassy’s attitude has been adhered
                            to partly because of the difficult local political situation, partly
                            because there has been the belief that the local newspapers, never
                            financially strong, could not survive the loss of income from those
                            advertisements, and also because it has been felt that any attempt to
                            induce individual newspapers to refuse to accept such advertising would
                            adversely affect the favorable publicity they now give us.</p>
                        <p>It must be admitted, too, that many of the leading advertisers in the
                            local newspapers, despite the fact that they are included in the
                            Proclaimed List, are among the most important firms in the country, are
                            locally considered as purely Paraguayan, and can hardly be replaced by
                            existing local companies. It is the opinion of the Embassy that
                            inclusion in the Proclaimed List has very definitely diminished their
                            income but has not substantially harmed their leading position, much
                            less started them on the road to financial collapse.</p>
                        <p>During the past two weeks Ferretería Universal S. A., included in the
                            Proclaimed List since its publication, has occupied its newly completed
                            quarters. Its retail showrooms are without doubt the most modern and
                            luxurious in Asunción. From the stock on display it is apparent that the
                            company has been able to maintain its sources of supply despite our best
                            efforts to cut them off. Each of the four daily newspapers, including
                            the official organ of the National Department of Press and Propaganda,
                                <hi rend="italic">El Paraguayo</hi>, carried large ads publicizing
                            the occupation of the new quarters. It was rather disappointing,
                            however, when <hi rend="italic">El Paraguayo</hi>, the official organ of
                            the National Department of Press and Propaganda, gave the company more
                            than a full page write-up on its new quarters. A copy of that issue of
                            the newspaper is enclosed herewith. (See Page 2 of <hi rend="italic">El
                                Paraguayo</hi> of June 27, 1943). The Department’s attention is
                            particularly invited to marked portions of the article. The Embassy
                            submits this article in <hi rend="italic">El Paraguayo</hi> as the most
                            outstanding and admittedly the most extreme example of the fact that the
                            local press not only ignores the Proclaimed List—it must be kept in mind
                            that the Paraguayan Government <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0693"
                            />has not recognized the Proclaimed List—but also is willing to give its
                            active support to local business houses despite the fact that they may
                            be included in that list.</p>
                        <p>There are several other aspects to the local situation. In most countries
                            the Embassy believes that it has been possible to convince local
                            newspapers that it would be in their best interests not to carry the
                            advertisements of Proclaimed List firms by letting them understand that
                            if such advertisements were carried it might be that American firms or
                            advertisements of American products would not be offered them.
                            Unfortunately this argument would not be effective in Paraguay inasmuch
                            as only one American firm, the International Products Corporation, and
                            four English firms, (Liebig’s Extract of Meat Co., Ltd., Ferrocarril
                            Central del Paraguay, Banco de Londres y América del Sud, and Haywood
                            Hermanos) operate in Paraguay. These firms do not carry the amount of
                            advertising that is carried by the Proclaimed List advertisers here. The
                            Embassy is reluctant to bring up the question of restriction of
                            newsprint and other supplies for the local press inasmuch as this could
                            too easily be used by individual newspapers as an indication that the
                            American Embassy might be attempting to interfere with the freedom of
                            the press. Actually, the press is under rigid control of the National
                            Department of Press and Propaganda and everything published locally must
                            have the approval of that department. It would be possible to discuss
                            the situation with the National Department of Press and Propaganda but
                            the Embassy cannot help but feel that inasmuch as the Paraguayan
                            Government has not recognized the Proclaimed List, Press and Propaganda
                            could hardly undertake the suppression of Proclaimed List
                            advertisements. It is doubtful that it would be advisable even to
                            suggest to Press and Propaganda that the continuation of these ads might
                            have an effect on the availability of newsprint from the United States:
                            that department could easily take the stand that cutting off supplies
                            for such activities was in effect an attempt to control the press, or
                            alternatively could easily act as importer for those newspapers which
                            the Embassy might decide to be undesirable.</p>
                        <p>It is the feeling of the Commercial Section of the Embassy that steps
                            should be taken to prevail upon the local press to revise its attitude
                            and cooperate with us on Proclaimed List matters, but before embarking
                            upon such a policy it is requested that the Department consider the
                            matter and express its opinion.</p>
                        <p>There is to be considered also the extent to which a strong stand on this
                            matter might affect our at present cordial relations with all Paraguayan
                            newspapers, whom we are gradually but surely converting into extremely
                            helpful pro-Ally media the nature of whose support at <pb n="680"
                                xml:id="pg_680" facs="0694"/>present considerably offsets the
                            adverse effect of Proclaimed List advertising.</p>
                        <p>It is hoped that an early reply to this despatch will be received.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State refers to the Embassy’s despatch no. 1153–A of
                            July 8, 1943 requesting the Department’s advice as to the procedure the
                            Proclaimed List Section of the Embassy should follow and the attitude it
                            should adopt toward the local press in view of its acceptance of
                            advertisements for Proclaimed List firms.</p>
                        <p>The Department believes that although it is clearly desirable to gain the
                            cooperation of the press in Proclaimed List matters, no steps to achieve
                            that end should be taken which might jeopardize the success that the
                            Embassy has had in improving the attitude of the press toward the United
                            Nations or which might produce unfavorable political repercussions. For
                            whatever use the Embassy may wish to make of it and not as a suggestion
                            that it be employed as a model in dealing with the problem, there is
                            enclosed herewith a copy of a memorandum of July 17, 1943 to an officer
                            in the Department from the British Embassy at Washington,<note n="24"
                                xml:id="d554fn24">Not printed.</note> describing the action taken by
                            the American and British Embassies in Santiago with regard to acceptance
                            of Proclaimed List advertisements by local newspapers. The Department
                            realizes that the financial considerations described in the despatch
                            under reference probably would make it impossible for newspapers in
                            Asunción to follow the course adopted by the Santiago press even if they
                            were disposed to do so. However, it would seem that the newspapers
                            should not resent a frank approach whereby they were informed of the
                            Embassy’s awareness of the financial considerations involved but that
                            the Embassy cannot sanction active support of Proclaimed List
                            enterprises. The distinction is clearly illustrated by the full-page
                            article in the July 27 issue of <hi rend="italic">El Paraguayo</hi>,
                            describing the new quarters of Ferreteria Aleman; that is free
                            advertising, cannot be justified on the basis discussed herein, and
                            therefore should be a proper subject for an approach by the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>The Officer in Charge is requested to report from time to time any
                            developments in this matter and particularly the reaction of a newspaper
                            to an approach such as that suggested for <hi rend="italic">El

                            Department’s circular airgram of June 21, (1943) 11: 30 a.m.<note n="25"
                                xml:id="d555fn25">Not printed.</note> requesting that the Department
                            be informed of <hi rend="italic">specific</hi> cases in which Axis

                            espionage, sabotage, propaganda and related activities.</p>
                        <p>There is transmitted herewith a memorandum<note n="25" xml:id="d555fn26"
                                >Not printed.</note> prepared by the Acting Legal Attaché of this
                                Embassy<note n="26" xml:id="d555fn27">Charles E. Apple.</note> on
                            July 27, 1943, which was designed to respond to the Department’s
                            request. The memorandum has not been forwarded earlier because of the
                            impending arrival of Mr. Raymond W. Ickes of the Alien Enemy Control
                            Unit of the Department of Justice. It was also anticipated that Legal
                            Attaché Frank G. Siscoe would return from Washington; and that possibly
                            some specific cases could be discovered which would be more responsive
                            to the Department’s requisites.</p>
                        <p>The memorandum does show, however, that the black listed firms here are
                            furnishing a large part of the financial support of the Asociación
                            Alemana de Ayuda Social, the parent organization of most German
                            activities here. There is as yet nothing feasible to show that the
                            German bodies thus supported are engaged in espionage, sabotage or
                            propaganda, and indeed it is the impossibility of demonstrating this
                            which has been the principal factor against inducing the Paraguayan
                            Government to take definite steps against the Germans in Paraguay.</p>

                            September 21, 1943, I have the honor to transmit herewith a memorandum

                            regard to the present progress of our efforts to secure the dissolution
                            of the Deutscher Volksbund (Union Germánica del Paraguay) and the

                            Committee for Political Defense seems to have arranged to suspend in the
                            immediate future the existence of the Volksbund, but only for the
                            duration of the war. I have some hope of eliminating this latter
                            provision through the influence of Foreign Minister Argaña.<note n="28"
                                xml:id="d556fn28">The closing of the Union Germánica, until a new

                            Committee proposes to collect further data before taking action, but to
                            exercise a strait [<hi rend="italic">strict?</hi>] surveillance
                            beginning at once.</p>
                        <p>In the meanwhile it will be observed from my despatch No. 1386 of October
                            8, 1943, and from my despatch No. 1328 of September 17, 1943,<note
                                n="29" xml:id="d556fn29">Neither printed.</note> that the Paraguayan
                            Government has taken positive and most helpful action in placing both
                            the German Bank and the Japanese Colony in Paraguay under rigid control.
                            It has also been fairly cooperative with regard to the functioning in
                            Paraguay of the two censors sent here from the United States, Mr. Bealer
                            and Lieutenant Ripley. (It has not furnished the special funds which
                            would be necessary to enable Mr. Bealer to function permanently, but
                            this is due to its perhaps justifiable belief that his presence if
                            permanent would become generally known and thus drive dangerous
                            correspondence out of the mails.)</p>
                        <p>The matter of requesting that a selected number of German organizers be
                            sent to the United States for detention, or be detained in a
                            concentration camp in Paraguay, is awaiting the Department’s reply to my
                            despatch cited in the first paragraph above. It is also awaiting the
                            general development of the situation with regard to the German Bank and
                            the Asociación Alemana de Ayuda Social. Quite clearly, however, the
                            Paraguayan Government is showing a much fuller spirit of cooperation on
                            the general problem of curbing subversive and dangerous activities.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my confidential telegram No.
                            585 of October 28, 11 a.m., with reference to the East-West runway of
                            the Asunción airport now under construction, I have the honor to report
                            that I received a visit on the 19th instant from Mr. John Dwyer, Airport
                            Development Program representative, acting as general superintendent of
                            the current construction work on the airport here. I understood that Mr.
                            Dwyer was acting under instructions from his superiors at Miami. He
                            referred to the terms of the Paraguayan Decree-Law No. 13,365 of July 2,
                            1942, “Which grants to Pan American Airways, Inc. the use of the
                            Government property located at Campo Grande, etc.;” and particularly to
                            the second Article of that Decree Law which reads as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Art. 2nd. Pan American Airways, Inc. shall be obligated to erect
                                    on the said property, in addition to the constructions already
                                    installed by it, those necessary for converting the said field
                                    into a modern airport, capable of handling the traffic of modern
                                    and heavy commercial aircraft, even during the rainy season, and
                                    likewise for night traffic. These constructions will consist
                                    principally of the following: Leveling and drainage of the land;
                                    construction of hard surface runways in the direction of the two
                                    predominating winds; storage installations and facilities for
                                    refueling; illumination of the field, so as to permit of night
                                    landing, and the construction and improvement of the buildings
                                    according to the requirements of the air traffic, such as the
                                    passenger station, radio-communication building, storage
                                    facilities, shops, etc., when and as the increased volume of the
                                    services require,”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In the first place, with reference to the provision that hard surface
                            runways be constructed “in the direction of the two predominating
                            winds,” Mr. Dwyer advanced the contention that these two winds are <pb
                                n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0698"/>both almost north and south,
                            corresponding roughly with the direction of the main runway now under
                            construction, so that the transverse runway as shown in the plans on
                            which the negotiations with the Paraguayan Government were based need
                            not be constructed under the terms of the paragraph above cited. The
                            plans which figured throughout the negotiations with the Paraguayan
                            Government over a period of almost a year were prepared by the Airport
                            Development Program, the final blue-print having been certified by it
                            under date of May 1, 1942. They included a “wind flower” indicating (1)
                            a north-south wind with a spread of approximately 22° and (2) a second
                            predominating wind running from west-northwest and to east-southeast,
                            about 80° removed from the north-south wind, also having a spread of 15°
                            to 20°.</p>
                        <p>It was on this second predominating wind that the necessity for the
                            transverse runway, which ADP was then anxious to secure, was based in
                            the negotiations. The frequency of this wind is much less than that of
                            the north-south wind in a ratio of approximately 1 to 5; but it was
                            explained to the Paraguayan Government by the Airport Program engineers
                            and the Pan American Airways representative here that modern air traffic
                            would necessitate the transverse runway in order to prevent the
                            paralysis of the airport during one-sixth of the year. This explanation
                            was also made by myself and the Military Attaché, at the request of the
                            ADP representatives, to the President of Paraguay and to the Minister of
                            War and Chief of Staff.</p>
                        <p>There can be no question but that the construction of the east-west
                            runway was authoritatively declared to be necessary by and on behalf of
                            the representatives of the Airport Development Program and the Pan
                            American Airways; and that the Decree-Law was issued by President
                            Morínigo on the basis of these representations. The Paraguayan
                            authorities suggested that the north-south runway be deflected, and that
                            the east-west runway likewise be deflected, in order to obviate the
                            necessity of condemning land pertaining to the Cavalry Unit contiguous
                            to the airfield. If the ADP had not represented the transverse runway as
                            necessary the difficulties which consequently supervened with the
                            Cavalry, and which had international repercussions, would have been
                            greatly attenuated; but the ADP, acting under instructions from Miami,
                            took the attitude that the two runways must be built as shown in the
                            plan certified May 1, 1942. It would appear that the present contention
                            of the ADP representative here, Mr. Dwyer, is based upon new plans
                            recently drawn up at Miami which instead of showing the prevailing
                            north-south wind as a single wind with a spread of 22° show it as two
                            winds 22° apart. (Obviously no two such “predominating” winds could
                            exist so close together.)</p>
                        <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0699"/>
                        <p>As the Paraguayan Government will feel that its good faith has been
                            abused if the two runways are not constructed in accordance with the
                            plan and explanations presented to them, it may be suggested that the
                            Department consult the ADP plan of May 1, 1942 and seek a technical
                            explanation of the “wind flower” shown thereon. The question might be
                            studied as to why the north-south wind should be represented as a single
                            wind with a spread of 22° if in fact it consists of two winds 22° apart.
                            The question also presents itself of why the “wind flower” showed a
                            transverse wind predominating during 16 percent of the year, if such a
                            wind did not exist.</p>
                        <p>In the second place, Mr. Dwyer, acting presumably under instructions,
                            called attention to the last phrase of Article 2 above quoted,
                            consisting of the words “when and as the increased volume of the
                            services require.” The Paraguayan Government and the Embassy understood,
                            and still understand, that this phrase applies to the illumination of
                            the field and the construction and improvement of buildings according to
                            the requirements of the air traffic; but Mr. Dwyer advances the
                            interpretation that it applies to all the construction work of the
                            entire project. The Department may be interested in securing from its
                            Legal Adviser a juridical interpretation of the language in question, or
                            in otherwise reaching a view with regard to the extent of the
                            applicability of the phrase. It is the Embassy’s understanding that the
                            Airport Development Program now wishes to avoid constructing the
                            transverse (east-west) runway on the ground that there has been no
                            “increase in the volume of the service.”</p>
                        <p>As indicated by my telegram No. 585 of October 28, 11 a.m., the failure
                            by the Airport Development Program to effect the construction in
                            accordance with the representations which it made, and which it
                            requested myself and the Military Attaché to make, based on the plan
                            which it submitted, would be interpreted by the Paraguayan Government as
                            an attempt to evade obligations formally assumed. The matter has not yet
                            been raised, either by the Embassy or the Airport Development Program,
                            with the authorities here, in view of my hope that the Department may be
                            able to effect an adjustment at Washington; but there is every reason to
                            feel that an abandonment of the east-west runway, which cost the
                            Government here great and protracted difficulties with the Armed Forces,
                            would create an extremely adverse impression.</p>
                        <p>The airport question here was for two years universally regarded as the
                            principal point on which Paraguay’s cooperation with the United Nations
                            turned. It was discussed not only throughout the various elements of the
                            Government but also by the general public, and indeed by every man,
                            woman and child in Paraguay. After the Government at length adopted a
                            firm and resolute policy in accepting the proposals <pb n="686"
                                xml:id="pg_686" facs="0700"/>of the Airport Development Program, and
                            forced the Army to accept them, the airport became a principal symbol of
                            Paraguay’s determination to cooperate with the United States and the
                            Allied nations. President Morínigo and his entire Cabinet officially
                            assisted at the inauguration ceremonies last May and were again shown by
                            the Airport Development Project representatives the plans, including the
                            transverse runway. On the journey of the President, the Foreign Minister
                            and the Finance Minister, with their suite, to the United States in
                            June, and to eight Latin American republics in July, they visited modern
                            airports at many places; and expressed to me and to other members of the
                            Embassy staff their satisfaction that a modern and complete airport was
                            to be constructed in Asunción,—feeling that the difficult decision which
                            they had reached and enforced would be justified by the endowment of
                            Asunción with such an airport. If the Airport Development Program, or
                            the United States Engineering Department, should now do otherwise than
                            comply with what are definitely regarded by Paraguay (and by the
                            Embassy) as definite obligations, the political effect here would be
                            most disadvantageous, and the results would hang over
                            Paraguayan-American relations like a pall for a long time to come.
                            Incidentally, Argentina would certainly capitalize the resulting
                            situation.</p>

                        <p>475. The War Department informs that present plans call for grading and
                            seeding the area near the intersection of the runways of the Asunción
                            airport, but that it is not proposed to construct a paved or graded
                            runway east and west. The War Department points out (1) that prevailing
                            winds would not permit the use of the east-west runway more than fifteen
                            percent of the time at most; (2) that runway arrangements as now planned
                            will be entirely adequate for any use that can reasonably be foreseen;
                            (3) that improvement of an east-west runway would add little, if any,
                            practical use value to this airport; and (4) that such an additional
                            expenditure would not be considered on a field in this country under
                            corresponding conditions.</p>
                        <p>The Department is informed that the present plans call for using all of
                            the land as originally laid out, including that part over which the
                            difficulties arose. Thus the only difference between what is now
                            provided for and what you request in your 585, October 28, 11 a.m. <pb
                                n="687" xml:id="pg_687" facs="0701"/>and your 626, November 22, 6

                            appears to relate only to the type of surfacing. Since the use of the
                            land and not the nature of the runway surface was presumably the issue
                            involved in your discussions with President Morinigo, the Department
                            feels that the present plans should be entirely satisfactory to the
                            Paraguayan authorities, especially since they appear to meet in every
                            respect the conditions of any undertaking on record in either the War or
                            State Departments.</p>

                        <p>483. Under present plans, the Paraguayans will acquire an airport that
                            for a long time to come will be entirely adequate to their needs. It
                            will be a credit to the national capital and superior to airports in
                            this country in most cities of approximately comparable size. To the
                            Paraguayans who hold title and have the beneficial use of the airport
                            and facilities, the cost will have been little or nothing at all, except
                            for the land. To the United States Government, however, the cost
                            according to present plans is estimated at over $603,000. Under these
                            conditions, the Department is satisfied, in spite of your 633, November
                            26, 5 p.m.,<note n="33" xml:id="d560fn33">Not printed.</note> that this
                            Government has adequately discharged all reasonable obligations arising
                            from the agreement to construct this airport.</p>
                        <p>The War Department has issued orders to USED, Recife, to send a competent
                            officer to Asunción at the earliest possible date to discuss this whole
                            matter with you and, if necessary, with the Paraguayan officials. For
                            your information, the prospect of authorizing any additional expenditure
                            on this airport is so remote as to be practically negligible and you
                            should conduct future negotiations accordingly.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Department’s confidential telegraphic instruction No. 483
                            of December 1, <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0702"/>7:00 p.m., with
                            respect to the change of plans for the Asunción airport.</p>
                        <p>The Paraguayan Government has as yet not been informed that the
                            construction of the east-west runway is no longer contemplated; and
                            subject to the Department’s instructions it would seem well that the
                            matter be not brought to the attention of the authorities here at this
                            juncture. At the time when the airport shall be completed there will be
                            a possibility that the Government may not feel disposed to make an issue
                            of the point. The circumstances may well be such in mid-February or
                            early March, when the work is expected to end, that difficulties may be
                            avoided.</p>
                        <p>In the meanwhile the very helpful observations which the Department has
                            furnished will be borne in mind. The Paraguayan Government has thus far
                            been disposed to accord frank recognition and appreciation of the
                            innumerable advantages which it has received from our Government.</p>

                            invitation to President Morínigo of Paraguay to visit the United States
                            about the middle of June of this year as a guest of this Government. <pb

                            formalities between President Roosevelt and President Morinigo by an
                            informal exchange of views to be carried on through you.</p>
                        <p>For your information in connection with the proposed visit, it is the
                            practice of this Government to pay all of the expenses of a Chief of
                            State and his party only while they are in the United States. However,
                            it will no doubt be possible to make arrangements for a United States

                            produce cement, jute products, and citrus concentrates; and also asked
                            if they could be helped to get some cold-storage plants going (which the

                            degrees of encouragement and discouragement; but Mr. Welles promised
                            that experts would be sent at once on at least three of the four
                            proposals to make surveys. He indicated that they would reach Paraguay
                            almost immediately. Subsequently, Finance Minister Espinoza asked Mr.
                            Welles at New York in the presence of Argaña, Morinigo and
                                Valázquez,<note n="46" xml:id="d568fn46">Celso R. Velásquez,

                            within a very short time. As soon as I returned to Asunción Dr. Argaña
                            got after me about the failure of the experts to arrive; and on

                            has of course not had a good effect on Argaña and Espinoza. They suspect
                            that the Export-Import Bank is so thoroughly committed to the theory
                            that nothing can be done in Paraguay except roads that it may not be
                            trying very hard to help out on any of the other projects. I feel that
                            the Export-Import Bank <hi rend="italic">does</hi> realize now that new

                            Paraguay. I wrote very briefly to Bonsal last week to see if his memory
                            checks mine on the statements given to the Paraguayans in Washington
                            about the arrival of the experts to make surveys. I don’t know whether

                            two general questions. This letter will reply briefly to the first of
                            those relating to the economic assistance to be extended to Paraguay
                            under the million dollar credit.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, your telegram of yesterday<note n="48"

                            Government of the detail of the cement experts.</p>
                        <p>With regard to citrus concentrates and cold storage plants, it is my
                            recollection that the Paraguayans were told that, although there was a
                            serious shortage of machinery, there would be willingness on our part to
                            fabricate a moderate sized cold storage plant and a small citrus fruit
                            processing plant, but that exact specifications from the Paraguayan
                            Government would be necessary before any production schedules could be
                            worked out. There was no commitment to furnish experts to make the
                            specifications. There is no reason why they cannot themselves get any
                            expert assistance they may need in formulating their specifications.</p>

                        <p>With regard to the jute plant, the Paraguayans were told that jutemaking
                            machinery was manufactured exclusively in Leeds and Belfast and not in
                            the United States. There are no American experts in this field, so we
                            could obviously not furnish the services of any such men.</p>

                            experts was in regard to the proposed cement plant.</p>

                            New York last June the Under Secretary of State promised on behalf of
                            the American Government to send experts to Paraguay promptly to assist
                            in preparing plans and specifications not only for a cement industry
                            here but also for jute, citrus concentrates, cold storage and dried milk
                            enterprises.</p>
                        <p>The three cement experts mentioned in the Department’s telegram No. 358
                            of August 25 (1943) 10 p.m.<note n="50" xml:id="d570fn51">Not
                                Printed.</note> have arrived, and the Paraguayan authorities are
                            impressed by the competence and sincerity of these advisers. The
                            estimate made by Mr. Hillegass that definite plans cannot be begun for
                            three or four months, and that some eighteen months would be necessary,
                            after the plans are completed, before even a small plant could be placed
                            in operation, is of course a disappointment; but on the whole the effect
                            of the presence of these gentlemen is highly favorable, and the
                            Paraguayan authorities are sincerely appreciative.</p>
                        <p>The two Ministers mentioned, however, profess an inability to understand
                            the situation with regard to the experts on the other four proposals.
                            When Dr. Argaña took the matter up with me on July 30th, <pb n="695"
                                xml:id="pg_695" facs="0709"/>my own recollection of the statements
                            made by the Under Secretary was in accord with this, and I consequently
                            did not raise the question of accuracy. This has handicapped me in
                            subsequent conversations. At the time of the interviews at Washington
                            and New York I had been traveling and living with the Paraguayan group
                            long enough so that I listened to the conversations in the Department
                            and the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel almost with Paraguayan ears. I thus
                            understood how pleased they were, after the rather adverse statements
                            made by Mr. Collado, when the Under Secretary added very graciously that
                            of course the American Government would be glad to send experts to aid
                            them in surveying the possibilities on the various industries, and then
                            added in response to a question that these experts would reach Paraguay
                            probably within three or four weeks. In my association with the
                            Paraguayan party during the fortnight which followed I heard them refer
                            several times to the prospective advent of the experts, which seemed to
                            them to indicate that our Government intended to interest itself closely
                            in their economic aspirations rather than merely to furnish funds. It
                            was therefore not a surprise, although Dr. Espinoza had not informed me
                            of his intentions, when he requested from the Under Secretary in the
                            Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on June 22nd a confirmation of this undertaking
                            which had impressed him and his associates so agreeably. The Paraguayans
                            present on that second occasion all understood, as did I, that the Under
                            Secretary renewed the undertaking and indicated that probably the
                            experts could be sent to Paraguay almost immediately.</p>
                        <p>It is of course now evident that both the Paraguayans and myself
                            misunderstood the statements in question; and I have pointed out to them
                            repeatedly that there is no reason why they should not themselves employ
                            American experts for the purposes in question. They admit that from the
                            standpoint of expenditure the matter is not of substantial consequence,
                            as the cost of securing experts for the purpose in question would be
                            only a few thousand dollars; but they unquestionably feel that the
                            misunderstanding with regard to the statements made to them may possess
                            a good deal of significance, and also that it indicates that the
                            interest of our Government in their proposals to promote new production
                            in Paraguay is less than they had believed and hoped.</p>
                        <p>Another member of the Paraguayan Cabinet has now informed me that at a
                            Cabinet meeting early this week Finance Minister Espinoza dealt with
                            this matter at some length and in a way to affect adversely the view of
                            his colleagues with regard to the desire of the United States to tone up
                            Paraguay’s economy. I understand that Foreign <pb n="696"
                                xml:id="pg_696" facs="0710"/>Minister Argaña, although, more
                            discreet in his tone, shared the general point of view thus
                            expounded.</p>
                        <p>I am doing everything in my power to attenuate the feeling which has
                            arisen, and to instill a rational spirit here with regard to Paraguayan
                            plans for new lines of production. I am particularly emphasizing the
                            importance and friendliness shown by the Department’s willingness to
                            arrange for the fabrication in the United States at this time of
                            machinery and plant equipment. As the weeks and months pass an
                            understanding will grow here of the helpfulness which our Government is
                            manifesting.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State refers to the Embassy’s despatch no. 1333 of
                            September 18, 1943 with regard to the insistence of the Paraguayan
                            Foreign Minister and Finance Minister that they were promised during
                            their visit to Washington and New York last June that this Government
                            would send experts to Paraguay to assist in preparing plans and
                            specifications not only for a cement industry but also for a number of
                            other economic projects. It appears from the despatch that the
                            recollection of the Paraguayan Cabinet officers is that the commitment
                            was made in a conversation in the Department between the Under Secretary
                            and the two Paraguayan Cabinet officers. In this connection there is
                            enclosed a copy of a memorandum of conversation of June 11, 1943<note
                                n="52" xml:id="d571fn52">Not printed.</note> covering the meeting in
                            question which was prepared immediately after the meeting. It will be
                            noted that there is no mention in the memorandum of any commitment to
                            send technical experts to Paraguay.</p>
                        <p>As the Embassy has been previously informed, the Department has made
                            arrangements for the temporary detail to Asunción by the Office of
                            Economic Warfare of a citrus concentrates expert in an endeavor to meet
                            the wishes of the Paraguayan Government, although no commitment in this
                            regard was made. The Department feels that adequate technical advice
                            concerning possible jute, cold storage, and dried milk enterprises can
                            be obtained by the Paraguayan Government from the members of the Food
                            Mission of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs now
                            in Paraguay and from other available local sources.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s memorandum no. 1060 of October 14, 1943, with regard to the
                            sending of experts from the United States to investigate or formulate
                            plans for new Paraguayan industries.</p>
                        <p>The presence in Asunción of the cement experts and the citrus concentrate
                            experts sent at the Department’s instance has created a favorable
                            impression; and the Paraguayan Government has for some months past been
                            cooperating continually with the American experts in the
                                Coordinator’s<note n="53" xml:id="d572fn53">Coordinator of
                                Inter-American Affairs.</note> agricultural project, known as the
                            Servicio Técnico Interamericano Cooperativo de Agricultura, with regard
                            to projects for refrigeration, jute and ramie, and milk production.</p>
                        <p>It may be worth mentioning that the hope of the government that special
                            experts be sent has arisen from two considerations which it regards as
                            practical in type, (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The creation or expansion
                            of industry in Paraguay must largely depend upon the sales prospects for
                            its products in the world market, and the Paraguayan Government feels
                            that it would be unable to ascertain such prospects without the help of
                            the American Government (partly because of the war and post-war economic
                            controls), (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) It is felt that the formulation of
                            plans would be inadvisable as to any industry unless the American
                            Government, and especially the Export-Import Bank, would be likely to
                            take an interest in such plans when once formulated; and with this in
                            mind the presence of officially-sent experts to participate in the
                            preliminary studies and the elaboration of such studies would be
                            considered to be especially helpful. However, as above indicated, there
                            seems to remain no further expectation of receiving such assistance.</p>

                            p.m., in reply to Embassy’s despatch 702, January 12,<note n="55"
                                xml:id="d574fn55">Latter not printed.</note> regarding sale of
                            petroleum products to Proclaimed List nationals.</p>
                        <p>Upon receipt of the Department’s airgram under reference an appointment
                            was made with the Minister of Agriculture, Commerce, and
                                Industries,<note n="56" xml:id="d574fn56">Francisco Esculies.</note>
                            under whose jurisdiction falls the rationing authority of petroleum
                            products which is practiced by the Direction General of Industries and
                            Commerce. The Minister as well as a representative of the Direction
                            General of Industry and Commerce were present at the conference.</p>
                        <p>The position of the Department was fully explained to the Paraguayan
                            authorities with emphasis upon the point that the provision of petroleum
                            products under the Pool system makes no allowance for the distribution
                            or sale of such products to persons or firms on the Proclaimed List of
                            Blocked Nationals. It was further suggested that if such sale or
                            distribution is continued it would be most difficult to justify the
                            allotments which have now been made on the basis of the essential needs
                            of the country’s economy. In view of the tenure <pb n="699"
                                xml:id="pg_699" facs="0713"/>[<hi rend="italic">tenor</hi>] of the
                            conversations the authorities were also reminded that the identical
                            situation exists as regards the sale of any tires and tubes which, while
                            in theory are received from Brazil, are actually part of the stocks
                            owned by the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>The Paraguayan authorities did not dispute the position taken by the
                            United States Government, rather did they agree that it is just and
                            reasonable. It has been agreed that the automotive registrations of the
                            country, particularly for Asunción, will be checked against the
                            Proclaimed List and that any vehicles belonging to either a firm or a
                            person on the Proclaimed List of Blocked Nationals will be eliminated
                            and will be granted no ration of petroleum products and will not be
                            permitted to purchase tires or tubes. The Minister pointed out that
                            there is in the Paraguayan market a certain amount of bootleg gasoline,
                            and even tires, smuggled out of Argentina, and that at least for the
                            moment the local Government could do nothing to prevent this gasoline or
                            the tires being bought by listed firms provided they are willing to pay
                            the price. The Minister did by indirection, in reply to a question,
                            state that he is exploring the legal implications of cancelling the
                            operating permits of all automotive vehicles, both cars and trucks,
                            belonging to listed firms or individuals.</p>
                        <p>There is no doubt of the willingness of the Paraguayan authorities
                            consulted to fully meet the suggestions of the Department within the
                            limits of available powers. The check list of the automobiles and trucks
                            to be denied gasoline rations and the right to purchase tires has been
                            offered to the Embassy for examination. However it is believed that this
                            administrative process should be left entirely in the hand of the
                            Paraguayan authorities although the Embassy will not hesitate to follow
                            this matter through should any vehicles belonging to listed parties be
                            seen in circulation after a reasonable period of time has elapsed.</p>

                        <p>A–241. Reference your A–138 of May 1, 1943. The willingness which you
                            found on the part of the Paraguayan authorities to meet the suggestion
                            of the Department in the matter of keeping petroleum products from
                            persons or firms included in the Proclaimed List is noted. You are
                            requested to report within a month or so on the degree to which the
                            desired results have been achieved.</p>
                        <p>The Department agrees that rather than having the Embassy examine lists
                            of automobiles and trucks to be denied gasoline rations, <pb n="700"
                                xml:id="pg_700" facs="0714"/>this administrative process should be

                        <p>Should you deem it advisable to follow up the matter with the Paraguayan
                            government in the event that Proclaimed List vehicles continue in
                            circulation, it would probably be desirable to limit your
                            representations to cases where the evidence which resulted in Proclaimed
                            List action is particularly strong.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the Embassy’s
                            Despatch No. 702, dated January 12th,<note n="58" xml:id="d576fn58">Not
                                printed.</note> in which the Department was requested to indicate a
                            policy regarding the sale of petroleum products supplied by the Pool
                            Committee by Paraguayan authorities to local firms on the Proclaimed
                            List of Blocked Nationals. Reference is also made to the Department’s
                            reply, airgram No. A–203, dated April 16, 6:30 p.m., 1943 and the
                            Embassy’s acknowledgment, airgram A–138, dated May 1, 8 a.m., 1943. The
                            Embassy’s reply under reference stated that this matter had been called
                            to the attention of the Minister of Agriculture, Commerce and Industries
                            and that he was in full agreement with the Department’s position that
                            petroleum products provided under the Pool system should not be made
                            available to the firms or persons in this country on the Proclaimed
                            List.</p>
                        <p>During the course of the month of May a close study has been made of the
                            automotive vehicles registered with the municipality with the idea in
                            mind of identifying those belonging to Listed firms. When gasoline
                            ration tickets were made available for the month of June these vehicles
                            and their proprietors were refused gasoline rations. A list of the
                            vehicles involved is being attached hereto<note n="58" xml:id="d576fn59"
                                >Not printed.</note> for the information of the Department.</p>
                        <p>From the point of view of actual numbers the attached list may not be
                            considered as impressive. It is important that the Government has
                            conformed to its undertaking and has definitely refused gasoline to
                            these firms. Conigliaro is one of the most important trucking firms in
                            Asunción while Zanotti, Cavazzoni, Billi y Cía rank as one of the most
                            important importers of foodstuffs. This development, as might be
                            expected, has raised a tremendous amount of adverse <pb n="701"
                                xml:id="pg_701" facs="0715"/>comment against the Direction General
                            of Industries &amp; Commerce which is responsible for the allocation of
                            fuel quotas. However, the Direction General as well as the Minister of
                            Agriculture have firmly stood their ground and it is refreshing to say
                            the least that such steps have been taken by the Paraguayan
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Upon the occasion of the discussion regarding this policy with the
                            Minister of Agriculture it was also mentioned to him that in principle
                            the same policy should apply to all supplies imported from the United
                            States and also tires and tubes which are obtained from Brazilian
                            sources. The Embassy has been assured by the competent authorities that
                            the trucks belonging to Listed firms which have been refused gasoline
                            supplies will also be refused purchase orders for either tires or
                            tubes.</p>

                            New York over the weekend with the Paraguayan Finance Minister<note
                                n="63" xml:id="d578fn63">Rogelio Espinoza.</note> regarding the
                            points on which agreement should be reached before issuance of the
                            notice of intention to negotiate. An agreement was reached, subject to
                            your approval, along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>It was pointed out to the Finance Minister that it had been our practice
                            to consider all charges collected at the customs (before release of the
                            goods), whether basic import duties, import surcharges or internal taxes
                            collected at the customs, as charges on or in connection with
                            importation, thus being distinguished from charges (which we considered
                            internal taxes) collected on imported goods after release from the
                            customs.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of such a distinction, the Finance Minister agreed to accept
                            the substance of our “standard” provision for national treatment on
                            internal taxes, and for a binding of all import charges without
                            exception on products on which concessions would be granted. This would
                            mean: 1) national and most-favored-nation treatment without any
                            exception in the case of internal taxes collected after release of goods
                            from the customs; 2) most-favored-nation treatment on imported goods
                            with respect to all charges collected at the customs before release of
                            the goods; and 3) binding without exception of all charges collected at
                            the customs on goods imported from this country on which concessions may
                            be granted.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the concluding paragraph
                            of the Department’s instruction no. 972 of August 17, 1943, in which it
                            was stated that definitive proposals regarding schedules for inclusion
                            in the proposed trade agreement with Paraguay would be forwarded
                            following consideration of the information presented at the public
                            hearings, there are enclosed definitive proposals regarding Schedules I
                            and II of the agreement.<note n="70" xml:id="d580fn70">Not
                                printed.</note> You may transmit these Schedules to the Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs and proceed to a discussion of them in an endeavor to
                            obtain agreement thereon.</p>
                        <p>In formulating the list of concessions on products of the United States
                            imported into Paraguay, this Government has attempted to restrict its
                            requests to moderate proposals, keeping in mind the extent of the
                            concessions it is in a position to offer in Schedule II of the
                            agreement. In the case of the majority of the items in Schedule I which
                            involve trade of considerable value, it will be noted that United States
                            requests are merely for the binding of existing customs treatment.</p>
                        <p>If Paraguayan officials are not willing to bind the present rates of duty
                            on lubricating oils and greases, in accordance with this Government’s
                            request on Tariff Paragraph 156 of Schedule I, you are authorized to
                            drop the request on that item. In the event of an unwillingness by those
                            officials to grant the concessions requested on any other items, the
                            matter should be referred to the Department for further
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>The rates of duty which are set forth in Schedule I are the basic
                            Paraguayan import duties only. It is understood, of course, that in
                            accordance with the provisions of the second sentence of Article VII of
                            the General Provisions of the proposed agreement, supplementary duties,
                            taxes, et cetera, on products imported from the United States which are
                            included in the Schedule will be bound against increase during the life
                            of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>It is not believed that the individual items in Schedule I require
                            specific comment except perhaps in the case of the note following
                            Paragraph 154. For your own information, it is the Department’s
                            understanding that the bulk of imports of leaf tobacco from the United
                            States would properly be classified under Tariff Paragraph 154(<hi
                                rend="italic">d</hi>) at a high rate of duty, whereas, as a matter
                            of practice, such imports are actually entered under Paragraph 154(<hi
                                rend="italic">e</hi>) at a substantially lower rate of duty. The
                            purpose of the note, of course, is to <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705"
                                facs="0719"/>maintain, during the life of the agreement, this
                            apparently irregular but favorable tariff situation affecting imports of
                            leaf tobacco from the United States. If the Paraguayan authorities raise
                            difficulties about the inclusion of the note (which is of greater value
                            than the binding of the rate of duty under 154(<hi rend="italic"
                            >e</hi>)), you might point to the fact that, in one of the four
                            exchanges of notes which supplemented the trade agreement between the
                            United States and Argentina, provision was made for continuing, during
                            the life of that agreement, the existing customs treatment of certain
                            articles about which there might have been some doubt.</p>
                        <p>The note which follows Tariff Paragraph 667 should be selfexplanatory. It
                            relates to such office equipment as “Dictaphones”, and is included at
                            the request of an exporter who had found that his product was apparently
                            being subjected to import duties as a musical instrument at much higher
                            rates than those generally applied to office equipment. You might point
                            out to the Paraguayan officials that a number of other governments have,
                            in recent trade agreements with the United States, agreed to the
                            classification of such machines as office equipment. Paragraph 667 seems
                            to be the most suitable paragraph in this section of the tariff under
                            which to include the note on dictating machines and parts and
                            accessories thereof.</p>
                        <p>Purely as a matter of convenience to you and possibly to the Paraguayan
                            officials, the proposed Schedule I has also been prepared in Spanish, in
                            conformity with the Paraguayan Tariff.</p>
                        <p>There is also enclosed for your convenience a copy of the report<note
                                n="71" xml:id="d580fn71">Not printed.</note> on Schedule I of the
                            Country Committee on Paraguay to the Committee on Trade Agreements. This
                            report is sent to you solely in order that you may have readily
                            available trade statistics regarding each item included in the Schedule.
                            The columns referring to the proposed rates of duty should be ignored,
                            as the proposals of the Country Committee were considerably modified by
                            the Committee on Trade Agreements.</p>
                        <p>It may be useful, in your discussions with the Paraguayans, to have
                            available data regarding trade coverage. From that standpoint, products
                            listed in Schedule I accounted for 28.6 percent of total Paraguayan
                            imports from the United States in 1940 while products listed in Schedule
                            II accounted for more than 95 percent of total United States imports
                            from Paraguay in the same year.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Schedule II, this Government has not found it possible to
                            accede to the Paraguayan Government’s request for concessions on castor
                            oil, lemon-grass oil and certain fatty acids and salts derived from
                            tallow, but requests for concessions on all other items which were
                            included on the list published here have been granted to <pb n="706"
                                xml:id="pg_706" facs="0720"/>the full extent permitted under
                            existing authority. It is understood that the tallow acids and salts are
                            not produced in Paraguay and their omission should therefore not be the
                            cause of any concern to the Paraguayan authorities.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the omission of castor oil and lemon-grass oil from
                            Schedule II, you may inform the Paraguayan officials that, in the
                            opinion of this Government, the position of Paraguay as a present or
                            potential supplier of the United States market does not warrant a
                            concession on these products to Paraguay in the first instance. If they
                            should be the subjects of concessions in later trade agreements
                            negotiated by this Government with other countries which are important
                            suppliers, however, imports from Paraguay would of course be entitled to
                            most-favored-nation treatment.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that the description of rum appearing in Schedule II is
                            the same as that used in previous trade agreements, and no special
                            reference has been made to “Paraguayan” rum. If the Paraguayan officials
                            take notice of this and again request specific reference to “Paraguayan”
                            rum, you may inform them that despite thorough investigation here it has
                            been impossible to obtain sufficient information regarding that product
                            and its use, if any, in the United States to permit specific reference
                            to it in the Schedule. As a matter of practice, the Bureau of Customs
                            insists that when some specific description such as “Paraguayan rum” is
                            used in a schedule, such reference shall be the common and commercial
                            designation of the product in the United States market. If the
                            Paraguayan officials insist on some such specific designation (which in
                            any case will result in no more beneficial concession than can be
                            granted on rum generally), you should request them to provide as
                            detailed information as possible concerning the products used in and the
                            process of manufacture of, the product, as well as any other information
                            which they can supply regarding the sale of the product in foreign
                            countries including the United States, and the specific name by which it
                            is known. It would be helpful, if you should have need to report further
                            on this matter to the Department, to include a label used on the product
                            as sold in Paraguay or abroad.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that concessions to the maximum extent permitted by the
                            Trade Agreements Act have already been granted on many of the products
                            included in the proposed Schedule II. In discussing this Schedule with
                            the Paraguayan authorities, you should emphasize the fact that the
                            concessions offered represent the greatest improvement in tariff
                            treatment which it is possible to accord in relation to the statutory
                            rates set forth in the Tariff Act of 1930. You should also stress the
                            value of the fact that, as a result of the proposed agreement, the
                            improved treatment of the products included in Schedule II <pb n="707"
                                xml:id="pg_707" facs="0721"/>would be granted to Paraguay in its own
                            right and that the Paraguayan products in question, upon importation
                            into the United States, would no longer have to depend upon extension of
                            most-favored-nation treatment by the United States in order to obtain
                            such improved treatment. Unless these facts are pointed out, Paraguayan
                            authorities may be inclined to overlook them in their consideration of
                            the proposed Schedule.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s Instruction No. 972 dated August 17th, 1943, (file No.
                            611.3431) enclosing for transmission to the Ministry of Finance a
                            revised text of the general provisions and related notes regarding the
                            proposed trade agreement between the United States and Paraguay.</p>
                        <p>The revised text was submitted to the Foreign Office with an unofficial
                            translation on August 30, 1943, and on numerous occasions since that
                            time the Minister of Hacienda and officials in the Foreign Office have
                            been contacted by First Secretary Montgomery to obtain the approval of
                            the revision, in view of the current belief that no action would be
                            taken until the completion of negotiation of a trade agreement with
                            Argentina. Assurances had been given me repeatedly by the Foreign
                            Minister that the two agreements were not interrelated, and by the
                            Minister of Hacienda that the matter of the American-Paraguayan
                            agreement would be cleared up prior to his departure for Buenos
                            Aires.</p>
                        <p>However, after the closing of the Foreign Office on October 23, the
                            Embassy received Note No. 718 dated October 22, 1943 with a copy of a
                            memorandum of the Ministry of Hacienda containing observations made by
                            that Department regarding various articles of the revised draft. Copies
                            of this note and its enclosure are enclosed herewith.<note n="72"
                                xml:id="d581fn72">Neither printed.</note> No indication was
                            previously given by the Ministry of Hacienda that the draft was not to
                            be approved unconditionally, and no opportunity was given to discuss it
                            either with the Ministry of Hacienda or the members of the
                            Interdepartmental Committee prior to the departure of the Minister for
                            Buenos Aires accompanied by Mr. Julio Bajac, the <pb n="708"
                                xml:id="pg_708" facs="0722"/>leading Foreign Office official dealing
                            with the American-Paraguayan trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>In view of the manner in which the Minister of Hacienda has handled this
                            matter, I cannot escape the feeling that the delay has been deliberate
                            so as to avoid the necessity for action prior to the
                            Paraguayan-Argentine negotiations. There was ample time to permit
                            consideration and a decision so that it could be submitted to the
                            Department for approval or comment prior to October 25, had the Minister
                            desired to facilitate that course.</p>
                        <p>There is also enclosed a copy of the unofficial translation<note n="73"
                                xml:id="d581fn73">Not printed.</note> that was sent by the Embassy

                            conversations with them thus far have been brief and casual. As there is

                        <p>The treaty contains two or three evidences that Dr. Espinoza secured the
                            inclusion in it of provisions which he discussed in Washington last June
                            (with Messrs. Fowler and Smith<note n="76" xml:id="d582fn76">William A.

                            own prospective trade agreement, and which were apparently special ideas
                            of his. (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The Argentine-Paraguayan trade

                            after denunciation by either side. It will be recalled that he objected
                            strongly to our provision for the termination of our trade agreement
                            only <hi rend="italic">thirty days</hi> after denunciation, (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) The treaty with Argentina provides for a mixed
                            commission with important functions, in conformity with Dr. Espinoza’s
                            idea that such a mixed commission can keep trade agreements alive <pb
                                n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0723"/>by adapting them continually,
                                (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The problem presented by Paraguay’s
                            incredibly tangled system of special internal duties on imported goods,
                            which amount to the second zone of tariff defense, is covered in the
                            Argentine treaty by approximately the same language which Finance
                            Minister Espinoza proposed in Washington when we endeavored to provide
                            against future discrimination arising from these secondary and indirect
                            imposts upon importation.</p>
                        <p>An interesting provision in the supplementary Argentine-Paraguayan
                            “Convenio Complementario” looking toward the balancing of exports and
                            imports between the two countries provides (see its Article 5) for the
                            promotion of new industries in Paraguay, for the despatch of Argentine
                            experts and technicians to study and formulate plans for such new
                            industries, and for the use of Argentine capital in connection with
                            them, drawn from funds deposited as a result of the balancing
                            operations. This doubtless reflects Minister Espinoza’s disappointment
                            that the American Government would not send experts to study
                            possibilities for new Paraguayan industries, in accordance with the
                            present Paraguayan urgent desire to <hi rend="italic">foment new
                                production</hi> in this country. From a practical standpoint the
                            arrangement need not be taken with seriousness, however, as it is to be
                            doubted whether Argentine technical advisers and funds will actually be
                            forthcoming in a manner actually to effect the founding of new
                            industries here.</p>
                        <p>It is perhaps to be deprecated that the Mixed Commission to formulate
                            measures to bring about the Customs Union between the two countries will
                            likewise have other functions of a permanent nature, so that it will
                            constantly hold meetings from time to time during the life of the
                            commercial agreements. If the Commission had been solely for the purpose
                            of working toward the Customs Union its sessions might have been
                            sporadic and it might gradually have ceased to be very active.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the visit of President Morínigo and Dr. Argaña to Buenos
                            Aires in mid-December, I am informed confidentially by the Uruguayan
                            Minister here that there seems to be little prospect of a visit to
                            Uruguay at that time. The Paraguayan Government is seriously
                            dissatisfied at the campaign conducted by Uruguayan labor unions,
                            students and newspapers against the Morínigo régime; and while it does
                            not doubt that the Uruguayan Government would take suitable precautions
                            if Morínigo were to accept its still-outstanding invitation, it believes
                            that untoward incidents would be highly likely to occur. This will leave
                            Uruguay as the only country in South America to which President Morínigo
                            will not have made an official visit during the present year. Presumably
                            he and Dr. Argaña hope that Uruguay will take steps gradually to bring
                            about the disappearance of the hostile agitation in Montevideo.</p>
                        <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0724"/>
                        <p>During my two curbstone conversations with Finance Minister Espinoza
                            since his return he made two remarks which may be of interest. In the
                            first place he was anxious to learn whether the American Government has
                            indicated that it accepts Paraguay’s assurances of continued loyalty to
                            the American and Allied group of nations despite the negotiation of the
                            Argentine agreements. (A certain amount of delay in any indication of
                            the Department’s attitude might possibly not have an unwholesome effect
                            here.) In the second place he inquired at once regarding the
                            Department’s reactions to his requests for changes in the text of the
                            proposed Paraguayan Trade Agreement with the United States. It is
                            conjecturable that he has a private sense of apprehensiveness because of
                            his unjustifiable delay in dealing with the draft submitted to him after
                            his return from Washington embodying the agreements which he had
                            accepted when he was in the United States. He will probably be glad to
                            move promptly now to secure the Agreement with us, as a demonstration
                            that Paraguayan-American relations have not been damaged.</p>

                        <p>A memorandum has just been prepared for the members of the Trade
                            Agreements Committee outlining the substantive objections on the part of
                            the Paraguayans to the revised draft general provisions. In their
                            counterproposal, the Paraguayans wish to omit the requirement of thirty
                            days’ advance notice in the case of administrative rulings effecting
                            advances in rates of duty. A definitive decision on this point will be
                            postponed pending determination as to whether the requirement would
                            involve a modification of the basic customs law of Paraguay or merely
                            entail a change in present administrative practice.</p>
                        <p>The second point raised by the Paraguayans concerns the impairment and
                            nullification clause of the general provisions. This Division has
                            submitted for the approval of the Trade Agreements Committee an
                            alternative which, it is felt, will meet the objections of the
                            Paraguayans.</p>

                                No. 1494, November 5, 1943, the Ambassador had recommended a new
                                review of the proposed schedules because of the drastic changes in
                                the Paraguayan customs and currency laws. The negotiations did not
                                come to fruition in a trade agreement until September 12, 1946.

                        agreement provided that the Defense Supplies Corporation should construct
                        such airports as were necessary for gathering wild rubber, on land donated
                        by Peru, using materials made available by but not at a cost to Peru. The
                        Defense Supplies Corporation was to operate the airports and provide and
                        operate aircraft. Peru was to refund certain taxes on the Corporation’s
                        supplies and personnel, grant passport visas, and allow the Corporation to
                        operate radio stations. The agreement was to be coterminous with the rubber

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            regarding the course of continued discussions with Finance Minister East
                            concerning the use of Peruvian ocean carriers in the United States
                            trade.</p>
                        <p>Mr. East did not modify his position that chartering is
                                unacceptable,<note n="1" xml:id="d584fn1">The Ambassador had
                                reported in his despatch No. 5758, January 5, 1943, that Peru
                                opposed chartering because it considered her vessels as the only
                                independent tie to the outside world, and regarded W. R. Grace and
                                Company as dominated by the War Shipping Administration
                                (800.8820/929). However, in his despatch No. 5709 of December 31,
                                1942, the Ambassador had noted Peru’s willingness to allow
                                chartering her vessels on the condition that the United States agree
                                to purchase 700 to 800 tons of surplus wool and to provide certain
                                gold mining supplies (800.8820/917).</note> but reiterated Peru will
                            place two vessels in this trade on a permanent basis without diverting
                            them for other uses. They will be <pb n="713" xml:id="pg_713"
                                facs="0727"/>under the direct administration of the Peruvian
                            Steamship Company which is owned by the Government. He expressed no
                            further interest in importing wheat from the United States. Other
                            Peruvian and foreign bottoms will be used for the Argentine trade.</p>
                        <p>The Minister was in possession of a telegram from the Peruvian Embassy in
                            Washington indicating 6,500 tons of wool had been tentatively spoken of
                            as a satisfactory amount to consider. This sum differs from his previous
                            estimate of 700 to 800 tons which evidently represented only alpaca
                            wool. In any case the 6,500 tons were described as of the 1943 clip and
                            is the amount Peru desires to ship in 1943. This quantity does not
                            include a 2,500 ton carry-over from 1942 which the Minister believes can
                            be disposed of in markets outside the United States.</p>
                        <p>A summary of the Minister’s views was reported in telegram No. 133 of
                            January 28, 5 p.m., 1943,<note n="2" xml:id="d584fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> to which the Embassy added its recommendation that
                            the amount of admissible wool be diminished proportionally to his
                            reduction from four to two vessels. Mr. East resisted the suggestion
                            regarding the proportional decrease for wool; remarked it might be best
                            to sell the wool in Mexico, whence inquiries had been received; and
                            observed that the entire problem had been disposed of in our last
                            conference. He even ventured that in the future it would be convenient
                            to have the statements of the American Government in writing so that
                            there could be no question of what was previously said.</p>
                        <p>After reminding him there is no misunderstanding, that negotiations are
                            impossible if one of the participants insists on the adoption of his
                            entire program without considering the desires of the other, we finally
                            agreed heartily the only difference consists of Mr. East’s pressure for
                            the maximum amount of wool while the American authorities were
                            endeavoring to obtain as many vessels as possible.</p>
                        <p>He requested that the American Government assign a reasonable percentage
                            of space for such cargo as the Peruvian authorities should desire to
                            ship northward and agreed to the reasonableness of a similar provision
                            regarding southbound cargo of interest to the United States. He based
                            his request for space reservation on information regarding the
                            arrangement with Argentina and could see no reason why similar treatment
                            could not be given Peru, even though Argentina had accepted the charter
                            provision and Peru will not.</p>
                        <p>He expressed the desire that the United States afford the customary
                            facilities extended to Allied ships in war time.</p>
                        <p>Presumably the next move will be taken in Washington, but should any new
                            developments occur in Lima, the Department will be informed
                            promptly.</p>

                            regarding Peruvian ships in United States trade. The Finance Minister
                            and the Embassy have received notice from Grace and Company that the War
                            Shipping Administration insists the <hi rend="italic">Ucayali</hi> load
                            cargo for New Orleans and gives the impression the ship is more or less

                        <p>Our original agreement was the two ships would go to the West Coast. The
                            Finance Minister has assumed a responsible attitude but earnestly
                            requests that the ships be authorized as usual to load for San Francisco
                            until full cargoes for Peru are available there. Thereafter he will send
                            them to New Orleans to cooperate as closely as possible with the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>This request seems reasonable and I wish to recommend it for the

                            original agreement is dictated purely by reasons of war necessity. There
                            is little if any cargo for Peru now on the West Coast since shipments
                            are not authorized to move until booking on a specific vessel has been
                            accomplished. Inasmuch as no bookings have yet taken place for movement
                            to Peru out of West Coast, there should be little if any cargo on hand
                            for Peru in West Coast United States ports. The Department understands
                            also that one of the Peruvian vessels will be permitted to go to the
                            West Coast. For your information this vessel (probably the <hi
                                rend="italic">Perene</hi>) can not make convoy speed in the
                            Gulf.</p>

                        <p>Through a misunderstanding some wool permits have not yet been issued by

                            Peruvian vessels from the War Shipping Administration and should any
                            problems arise in connection therewith you should first discuss the

                                printed.</note> Conversations with Chavez<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d587fn6">Juan D. Chavez, Peruvian Commercial Counselor in

                            conclusion that the Peruvian export control cannot be coordinated with
                            our import control without much loss of time and delay of shipments.
                            Peru would lose by such interference with her exports. WSA<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d587fn7">War Shipping Administration.</note> cannot be
                            expected to put in vessels to lift Peruvian products without assurance
                            that these products can be exported. Such control is likely to interfere
                            especially with occasional last-minute arrangements to fill in with
                            non-essential cargo which Peru cannot ordinarily ship.</p>
                        <p>It is believed here that WSA has not discriminated against the Peruvians
                            in the allocation of cargo. Delay in getting cargo for the first trip of
                            the Peruvian vessels was caused by the lack of an agent here (see
                            Department’s 212, February 22).<note n="5" xml:id="d587fn8">Not
                                printed.</note> On May 7, before the <hi rend="italic">Ucayali</hi>
                            was ready to load for second voyage, Grace, as WSA’s agent, cabled that
                            zinc concentrates cargo was being worked out. When this was not
                            accepted, a sugar and wool cargo was agreed to by a Grace cable of May
                            22. Now, WSA learns that the <hi rend="italic">Perené</hi> will carry
                            this sugar and perhaps some flax, and the Peruvians want the <hi
                                rend="italic">Ucayali</hi>, which is now engaged in coastal trade,
                            to load lead and copper bars in late June.</p>
                        <p>It appears that the Peruvians do not wish to carry priority cargo laid
                            out by WSA as had been agreed. If you believe it will help to make the
                            Peruvians forget, hereafter, their objection to putting the <hi
                                rend="italic">Ucayali</hi> in the New Orleans run, permission will
                            be granted for the lead and copper cargo, but we would much prefer to
                            have priority cargo moved.</p>
                        <p>The Department feels that it may have been a mistake for the request for
                            the <hi rend="italic">Ucayali</hi> to go to New Orleans to have come
                            through <pb n="716" xml:id="pg_716" facs="0730"/>Grace, but it is hoped
                            the Peruvians will understand the request was made only because
                            unanticipated congestion on the West Coast forced diversions of all
                            vessels possible to other areas. Chilean and Grace Line vessels are also
                            required to go into the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>Please endeavor to straighten out the misunderstanding with the Peruvians
                            and see if a better understanding of the situation will not lead them to
                            withhold application of the export control.</p>
                        <p>Your recommendation as to whether the <hi rend="italic">Ucayali</hi>
                            should be permitted to move lead and copper bars is needed promptly
                            since WSA is delaying an answer to the Peruvian request.</p>
                        <p>It has just been learned that 1500 tons of zinc concentrates at Supe can
                            be made available for <hi rend="italic">Ucayali</hi> and this is far
                            more needed for the war effort than lead. It is hoped you can arrange to
                            have it lifted.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that the Minister of Foreign Affairs<note n="9" xml:id="d588fn9">Alfredo
                                Solf y Muro.</note> has expressed concern over recent report, that
                            with the sale of the Chilean passenger vessels to the American
                            Government this coast will be without passenger service.<note n="10"
                                xml:id="d588fn10">For correspondence on Chilean shipping problems,

                        <p>The Minister remarked that this is a disturbing development, and added
                            that many Peruvian business men and officials are unable to travel
                            abroad on business considered important to them owing to the limitations
                            on transportation by Panagra.<note n="11" xml:id="d588fn11">Pan American
                                Grace Airways.</note> He cited recent reports submitted to him to
                            the effect that about eighteen outstanding Peruvians are now off-loaded
                            at different air terminals between Lima and Miami and that the
                            congestion seems to be increasing rather than diminishing. He inquired
                            if there is any immediate prospect of relief either by inaugurating
                            restricted steamer passenger service or increasing the number of
                            airplanes on the West Coast run.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, if the Department is in possession of any useful
                            information regarding the possibility of improvement, I should

                            American Government that Finance Minister East today stated he and the

                            request to me for assistance in obtaining the allocation of shipping
                            space for 100,000 tons of Australian wheat for delivery during the
                            remainder of this year or perhaps extending over into the first two or
                            three months of 1944. The Minister stated that this is a necessary,
                            precautionary measure owing to the general shortage of bottoms and the
                            limited number of Peruvian ships, one of which was recently damaged in
                            Chilean waters.</p>

                            bread supply which is so largely dependent on imported wheat.</p>

                            7219 of June 28, 1943 concerning the probable suspension of ocean
                            transportation services to the West Coast of South America.</p>
                        <p>While the sale of the Chilean passenger vessels to the United States has
                            not as yet been consummated, it is confidently expected that the vessels
                            will be acquired shortly, thus withdrawing them from passenger service.
                            In so far as the Department is aware, there is no immediate prospect of
                            the situation being relieved by any additional shipping service. With
                            reference to the possible increase of the number <pb n="718"

                            withdrawal of the Chilean vessels and has supported a recent Panagra
                            request for additional transport aircraft. Although this type of
                            airplane is in urgent demand, it is understood that Panagra has been
                            assigned two additional planes, which should help to alleviate the

                        <p>A–928. Your A–1196, August 5, 5 p.m. Department inquired of the War
                            Shipping Administration as to the possibilities of obtaining the
                            allocation of shipping space for 100,000 tons of Australian wheat for
                            delivery during the remainder of 1943 and possibly extending into the
                            first part of 1944. The War Shipping Administration is definitely
                            opposed to rendering any assistance in the allocating of shipping space
                            for movement of wheat from Australia on the grounds that Peru is
                            receiving ample supplies of wheat at the present time from Argentina and
                            Australia, and that to arrange wheat imports from Australia would
                            require diversions of shipping and serious delays at a time and in an
                            area where this must be avoided for obvious military reasons.</p>
                        <p>According to the records of the War Shipping Administration, the movement
                            of wheat from Australia to Peru in 1943 through June 22, 1943 amounted
                            to 31,429 tons. Additional expected arrivals of Australian wheat in Peru
                            amount to 17,100 tons, or a total movement of wheat from Australia to
                            Peru known to date in 1943 of 48,529 tons.</p>
                        <p>In addition, statistics of exports of wheat from Argentina to Peru for
                            1943 through July 8, 1943 show a total movement of 40,109 tons. This
                            compares with the total exports of wheat from Argentina to Peru for
                            recent years as follows: <table rows="4" cols="2" rendition="#center-block" rend="width: 60%">

                        <p>To summarize the above, the total of arrivals and expected arrivals of
                            wheat in Peru from Argentina and Australia to date in 1943 amount to
                            88,638 tons.</p>

                        <p>If Embassy is of firm opinion that Peru is facing a crisis with respect
                            to Peruvian wheat supply, the War Shipping Administration informs the
                            Department that it sympathetically would consider releasing the Peruvian
                            Government from its obligation of maintaining the two Peruvian vessels
                            now in the trade between Peru and the United States, which vessels could
                            be employed in transporting wheat from Argentina.</p>

                                printed; it reported that two Norwegian vessels, scheduled to bring
                                to Peru some 15,000 tons of wheat, had been requisitioned by British
                                and Australian authorities.</note> The Department has communicated
                            again with the War Shipping Administration concerning the allocation of
                            shipping space for the movement of wheat to Peru from Australia,
                            Argentina or any other source. That agency has reiterated its inability
                            to allocate such space. Without going into details about the routing of
                            vessels from the South and Southwest Pacific, the War Shipping
                            Administration has again informed the Department that diversion of
                            vessels to the West Coast of South America cannot be done at the present
                            time without an appreciable loss of ship time at a period when it can be
                            least afforded because of overall requirements in the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the requisitioning by British and Australian authorities
                            of two Norwegian vessels scheduled to move under charter over 15,000
                            tons of wheat from Australia, information possessed by the War Shipping
                            Administration indicates that these Norwegian vessels already had been
                            chartered by the Australian Government and presumably have been diverted
                            from the Peruvian trade because of more urgent Australian requirements
                            in other areas.</p>
                        <p>The War Shipping Administration has also informed the Department that it
                            has neither been advised of the taking off of the Peruvian-American run
                            of the <hi rend="italic">Ucayali</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Perene</hi> nor of the contents of the correspondence between the
                            Office of Economic Warfare in Washington and its representative in Peru
                            concerning the same subject.</p>
                        <p>The War Shipping Administration has pointed out to the Department that
                            the Peruvian merchant marine fleet engaged in foreign trade consists of
                            seven vessels, namely: <hi rend="italic">Tumbes, Apurimac, Rimac,
                                Perene, Ucayali, Maranon, Mantaro</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                                >Urubamba</hi>. After making allowances for the routing of a vessel
                            to Chile for the hauling of <pb n="720" xml:id="pg_720" facs="0734"
                            />nitrate and the need for a Peruvian vessel in the Iquitos trade, there
                            appears to be an appreciable amount of Peruvian tonnage available for
                            the run to the Plate to load wheat.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            of further developments pertaining to the cancellation of insurance
                            written for Proclaimed List firms. The initiation of the Embassy’s
                            renewed activities in this phase of our economic warfare program was
                            reported in despatch No. 5877 of January 18, 1943 (page No. 2).<note
                                n="19" xml:id="d593fn19">Not printed.</note> Indications are
                            favorable that some degree of success will be achieved (thanks to the
                            Department for the timely and indisputable intercepts) although, as
                            usual, there is some hesitation and bickering.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The following developments may be of interest and value to the
                            Department. Mr. Figari, Superintendent of Banks and also Supervisor of
                            insurance companies, stated on February 6 that he had been informally
                            advised that it is going to be necessary to terminate all insurance
                            contracts with Japanese and Germans. He did not say “Proclaimed List
                            firms”. Apparently the full measures will not be applied to Peruvian
                            cloaks. Dr. Gallagher,<note n="20" xml:id="d593fn20">Manuel Gallagher,
                                official of the Peruvian Ministry of Finance.</note> in discussing
                            the insurance matter with Mr. Figari on the same occasion, remarked that
                            the greatest difficulty is in regard to life insurance contracts. A
                            person who has been paying premiums on a policy for a number of years
                            has an interest in the reserves of the company and his policy is a
                            vested right. He could not easily see a legal basis for an order by the
                            Peruvian Government to the insurance companies to terminate these
                            contracts.</p>
                        <p>Insofar as merchandise was concerned, he pointed out that it might be the
                            case that much of the merchandise in German and Japanese firms is still
                            unpaid for and, therefore, the Peruvian suppliers have a vital interest
                            in the unpaid merchandise being insured. It was pointed out that the
                            United States has been at war for over fourteen <pb n="721"
                                xml:id="pg_721" facs="0735"/>months and that anyone who supplied
                            merchandise to these firms during the last year should not have done so
                            in view of the Peruvian laws prohibiting transactions with Germans and
                            Japanese. He agreed to this statement as did Mr. Figari. The latter said
                            that any merchandise which has been delivered during the last year was
                            “mal vendido” and if it were burned up without insurance the seller
                            would be “bien pagado”.</p>
                        <p>The question then arose as to the effect on the insurance companies of
                            terminating all these contracts at one blow.… The agreement at the
                            termination of the conversation was that Mr. Gallagher was to call on
                            the Minister of Finance<note n="21" xml:id="d593fn21">Julio L.
                                East.</note> and discuss the various aspects of the problem with him
                            and that Mr. Figari would determine from all of the insurance companies
                            the amount of insurance involved, broken down into insurance of Japanese
                            firms and insurance of German firms, and similarly broken down into life
                            insurance, insurance on buildings and insurance on personal
                            property.</p>
                        <p>It may be interesting to note that in the course of the conversation Mr.
                            Gallagher stated that he considered the innumerable Japanese
                            establishments in Lima a definite peril, that should Hirohito<note
                                n="22" xml:id="d593fn22">Emperor of Japan.</note> send word to his
                            subjects to set fire to their establishments at a certain time and date
                            they would undoubtedly obey, and most of Lima would possibly be
                            destroyed.</p>
                        <p>It was pointed out to the conferees that such an eventuality is the best
                            possible argument for cancelling the insurance, including life
                            insurance, since such a conflagration likely would produce a riot in
                            which Japanese lives covered by insurance would be lost.</p>
                        <p>Further developments will be reported.</p>

                                    republic is required to take appropriate action to prevent
                                    transactions in securities located outside the Western
                                    Hemisphere, which would benefit the Axis. In view of Axis
                                    looting in the occupied countries and the convenient channel
                                    provided by Switzerland to realize on such loot, it is believed
                                    that any transaction involving the repatriation of securities
                                    from Switzerland should be viewed with suspicion, particularly
                                    where payment for such securities would be made by remittances
                                    abroad. In this connection if the price for which securities are
                                    being repatriated is below recent market prices, this will lend
                                    credence to suspicions that the Axis may benefit. Consequently,
                                    it would be highly desirable for the Peruvian Government to
                                    prevent this transaction unless it obtains complete information
                                    concerning the ultimate beneficiaries.</item>

                                    payments on bonds, the Peruvian Government, under Resolution II
                                    of the Washington Conference, should take all steps necessary to
                                    prevent undesirable interests from benefitting from such
                                    transfers. As you know, any such remittances from the United
                                    States to Switzerland must, in the absence of a special license,
                                    be remitted pursuant to General License 50,<note n="25"
                                        xml:id="d594fn25">Board of Economic Warfare issuance.</note>
                                    which provides that any such transaction can be undertaken only
                                    pursuant to the direction of the Swiss Government or the Banque
                                    Rationale Suisse, and then only if no national of a blocked
                                    country other than Switzerland has an interest in the transfer.
                                    A Swiss corporation, 25 percent or more of whose stock is owned
                                    by a national of another blocked country, say Italy, is a
                                    national of Italy as well as of Switzerland and hence the
                                    transaction cannot be consummated under General License 50.
                                    Reports are required to be filed as to all transactions
                                    consummated under the general license. This permits scrutiny to
                                    determine whether the terms of the general license have been
                                    complied with. Further this Government would probably not grant
                                    special licenses for transfers not covered by General License 50
                                    unless it first received full information as to the ultimate
                                    beneficiaries. This requirement would not be waived merely
                                    because a Swiss bank or corporation stated that it could not
                                    legally divulge the names of the ultimate beneficiaries and that
                                    it was impossible to trace the holders of bearer
                                    securities.</item>

                            will not be permitted unless there is absolute proof forthcoming as to

                            proof make it desirable that the transaction be prevented altogether);
                            and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) that remittances to Switzerland for
                            interest payments on Peruvian securities not be permitted unless
                            appropriate assurances are first obtained either from the Swiss
                            Government or the Banque Rationale Suisse that only Swiss interests will
                            benefit.</p>

                            however, it would appear that there is some connection between those
                            companies and Finapar. Finapar is on the British Black List and our
                            Confidential List as it is suspected of being Italian owned. Finapar has
                            also apparently had correspondence with Dr. G. Brianchind of Lima, Peru,
                            as appears from an intercept of January 15, 1941, concerning a shipment
                            of electric meters from the factory in Switzerland via Italy and Lisbon
                            to its ultimate destination (presumably the Lima Light &amp; Power
                            Company). The Department is requesting other Washington agencies and the
                            Embassy in Bern to investigate the Swiss companies involved.</p>

                            Peruvians are only to be made in the future through the diplomatic <pb
                                n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0739"/>representative of the power
                            representing the interests of Peru in the place where the payment is to
                            be made. The text in translation of the article dealing with this latter
                            feature is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Upon the issuance of the ministerial
                                    authorization, the bank shall place the money at the disposition
                                    of the diplomatic representative who represents the interests of
                                    Peru in the place where the payment is to be made in order that
                                    said diplomatic agent may proceed to make the payment to the
                                    beneficiary.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The manner in which this provision would operate was discussed with the
                            Superintendent of Banks and with an officer of the Banco de Credito del
                            Peru, which latter institution in the past has been the channel through
                            which substantially all subsistence remittances to Europe were effected.
                            It was suggested that it would be desirable for the remitting bank to
                            place the funds at the disposition of the Swiss government and have this
                            government notify its representative to make the payment. However,
                            inquiry at the Banco de Credito on March 11 disclosed that two
                            remittances under the new regulations have been made to Italy—one to
                            Rome and one to Genoa. The bank stated that in the case of the Rome
                            remittance it had instructed its correspondent in Switzerland to pay a
                            certain quantity of Swiss francs to the Peruvian diplomatic
                            representative in Vatican City for the benefit of the Peruvian
                            beneficiary. In the case of the Genoa remittance, the instructions given
                            the Swiss correspondent were similar with the exception that the funds
                            were to be placed at the disposition of the Swiss diplomatic
                            representative in Genoa, Italy.</p>
                        <p>On February 9, 1943, a memorandum was delivered to the Ministry of
                            Finance, pointing out the serious concern of the government of the
                            United States over the fact that official Axis funds in Peru, and
                            particularly the cash funds reportedly turned over to the Spanish
                            Embassy, have not been blocked, and also pointing out that the
                            Government of the United States has requested the representing power to
                            deposit the funds of the Axis nations in their hands in appropriate
                            banks. The memorandum also suggested the desirability of effecting an
                            arrangement whereby the Axis powers would pay for their representation
                            expenses in Peru by depositing Swiss francs to the credit of the
                            Peruvian Government in Switzerland, which francs could be used for
                            Peruvian expenditures. No reply has been received to this memorandum,
                            nor is any information in the possession of the Embassy as to any steps
                            having been taken by the Peruvian Government along either of the above
                            suggested lines.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the Department’s suggestion that the United States
                            might be interested in purchasing Swiss francs, an investigation has
                            revealed that no substantial quantity is available in Peru. The
                            commercial banks on December 31, 1942 held Swiss francs in the <pb
                                n="726" xml:id="pg_726" facs="0740"/>sum of 484,834 and the Central
                            Reserve Bank 202,061. Those of the Central Reserve Bank belong to the
                            Peruvian Government and are used by it to meet its representational
                            expenditures. Those held by the commercial banks actually belong to
                            individuals in Peru, since the banks themselves are prohibited by law
                            from owning foreign currencies. Should the increasing stringency of
                            remitting francs or of otherwise using them result in substantial sums
                            becoming available, the Department will be promptly advised.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: For your information and for that of the
                            appropriate members of your staff, there is herewith transmitted a
                                memorandum<note n="29" xml:id="d597fn29">Not printed.</note>
                            entitled “Analysis of Peruvian Control Measures in the Light of the
                            Resolutions Adopted at the Inter-American Conference on Systems of
                            Economic and Financial Control”. As the title indicates, the memorandum
                            represents a study of the extent to which the Peruvian laws, decrees and
                            regulations governing undesirable financial and commercial transactions
                            comply with the requirements of the resolutions adopted by the
                            Inter-American Conference on Systems of Economic and Financial Control.
                            The study was compiled on the basis of the information available to the
                            Department and it is designed to serve as a guide in Washington as well
                            as to point out certain deficiencies in the local controls which should
                            be considered by you and your staff with a view toward discussions with
                            the appropriate authorities of the Peruvian Government. Similar studies
                            with respect to the other American republics have already been compiled
                            or are in the process of completion.</p>
                        <p>While the evolution leading to the adoption of the laws presently in
                            force in Peru has been slow, in general, Peru has adopted legislation
                            which provides a satisfactory basis for the implementation of the
                            aforementioned resolutions. Of great importance throughout has been the
                            excellent cooperation between the Embassy and the Peruvian Government.
                            At least until recently, the main weakness in the Peruvian controls has
                            been a failure vigorously to administer the laws in effect. It would
                            appear from recent despatches, however, that the Embassy’s efforts
                            toward securing a more effective administration <pb n="727"
                                xml:id="pg_727" facs="0741"/>of the controls are bearing fruit and
                            that the Peruvian authorities are now pursuing a policy which, if
                            carried to completion, may well lead to the complete elimination from
                            the economic life of Peru of all persons whose activities are deemed
                            inimical to hemispheric defense. It is hoped that this policy will be
                            continued and will be applied with equal vigor to undesirable persons of
                            Peruvian citizenship as well as to those of enemy nationality.</p>
                        <p>In view of the recent developments in the administration of the Peruvian
                            controls, it is suggested that a reclassification of the Peruvian
                            Proclaimed List be undertaken in accordance with the principles set
                            forth in the circular instruction of December 17, 1942,<note n="30"
                                xml:id="d597fn30">Not printed.</note> which suggests certain
                            classifications of persons on the Proclaimed List. With respect to
                            delisting firms from the Proclaimed List, the Department is generally in
                            accord with the procedure outlined in despatch no. 5877 of January 18,
                                1943,<note n="30" xml:id="d597fn31">Not printed.</note> in which it
                            is suggested that firms adopt new names while the former names remain on
                            the list. Care should be taken, however, to insure that the old names,
                            and whatever good will may attach to them will not be used as a means of
                            permitting Axis interests to regain their lost power in the future. In
                            either case, however, a statement that this Government is prepared to
                            delist business enterprises when their transfer to desirable persons is
                            accomplished or their undesirable elements are removed, may, it is
                            suggested, prove an added inducement for the effective administration of
                            the Peruvian laws.</p>
                        <p>The memorandum transmitted herewith was prepared prior to the receipt of
                            despatch no. 5877 of January 18, 1943, and despatch no. 6050 of February

                            program. No attempt has been made to revise the memorandum by reason of
                            these recent developments and it should, of course, be read with that in
                            mind.</p>
                        <p>It is requested that, after you have had an opportunity to examine the
                            enclosed memorandum, you advise the Department as to any sections or
                            statements of the analysis with which you are not in agreement. However,
                            if you are in agreement, you are authorized, in your discretion, to

                            translation of the Supreme Decree of April 10, 1943,<note n="33"
                                xml:id="d598fn33">Enclosure not printed.</note> setting a time limit
                            to the period in which Axis business enterprises may be nationalized,
                            and stipulating that all Axis agricultural, industrial, commercial, as
                            well as all other kinds of businesses referred to in Article 2 of Law
                            9586 which are not transferred to Peruvians in accordance with the
                            provisions of laws 9586 and 9592 before May 31, 1943, will be
                            expropriated by the State.</p>
                        <p>The new decree extends the principle of expropriation to real estate
                            occupied by business establishments which were exempted from such
                            proceedings in the previous laws and regulations.</p>
                        <p>Finance Minister East and Dr. Gerardo Balbuena (President of the Chamber
                            of Deputies and author of the decree of April 10 here referred to)
                            quoted President Prado as having declared expropriation activities would
                            begin promptly on June 1 and would be concluded rapidly.</p>
                        <p>According to the decree, the details of transfer to Peruvians will be
                            arranged in due course after expropriation. This procedure was specified
                            for the purpose of terminating Axis economic activities immediately
                            after May 31.</p>
                        <p>Another innovation of the decree places administration after
                            expropriation, and pending final transfer, under the official
                            dependencies, such as the Banco Industrial, Banco Agricola, Banco
                            Minero, Caja de Seguro Social, etc., or under private organizations,
                            already existing or to be created; thus eliminating the delay formerly
                            experienced in endeavoring to effect transfer to Peruvians without prior
                            expropriation. It should also diminish the collusion with enemy
                            proprietors which so retarded nationalization under the old system.</p>
                        <p>The original draft of this decree cited the reasons for its promulgation,
                            but they were omitted in the finally published text, presumably to avoid
                            criticism. Among them was a concrete statement to the effect that the
                            application of laws 9586 and 9592 (by the Superintendency of Economy)
                            had failed to permit rapid and full realization of the Government’s
                            declared policy of intercontinental solidarity in the present

                        <p>The Superintendency of Economy was unsuccessful in curbing Axis business
                            activities to the desired degree … Very important were the deficiencies
                            of the existing powers. For instance, there was no clear authority to
                            expropriate the real estate occupied by business entities.</p>

                            6771 of May 8, 1943,<note n="34" xml:id="d599fn34">Not printed.</note>
                            reporting proposed new regulations of the Superintendent of Banks,
                            designed to render more effective the Peruvian control of international
                            financial transactions.</p>
                        <p>A copy of the new regulations which are contained in Circular No. 329 of
                            the Superintendent of Banks, dated May 24, 1943, together with a
                            translation thereof and of the covering letter from the Ministry of
                            Finance, dated May 24, 1943, are enclosed.<note n="35" xml:id="d599fn35"
                                >Enclosures not printed.</note> It will be noted from the covering
                            letter that Circular No. 329 is designed to bring the Peruvian banking
                            controls into closer harmony with the recommendations of the Washington
                            Conference on Systems of Financial and Economic Control. It is of
                            interest to note in the Circular itself that transactions are forbidden
                            with persons included in the “black list.” It is understood from the
                            Superintendent of Banks that this term is meant to refer to the
                            Proclaimed List of Certain Blocked Nationals. It will also be observed
                            in Section (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) of Article 2 that drafts for
                            remittances to foreign countries must be issued to the order of the
                            beneficiary. This provision was included in an effort to avoid the
                            common practice of buying bank drafts payable to the order of the
                            purchaser who can then endorse it to anyone’s order and thereby
                            circumvent the local controls. It is hoped under Article 3 to secure
                            some character of assurance from neutral countries such as Argentina,
                            Switzerland and others that financial transactions effected with those
                            nations will not benefit the Axis.</p>
                        <p>As reported in a series of despatches, the last being No. 6910 of May
                                22,<note n="34" xml:id="d599fn36">Not printed.</note> discussions
                            are presently being carried on with the Swiss representatives <pb
                                n="730" xml:id="pg_730" facs="0744"/>in an effort to work out a
                            system of control for that country. It is stated by the Superintendent
                            of Banks that it will be necessary to arrange some system for
                            remittances to Argentina since the volume of transactions with that
                            country is rather large, but that in all probability it will not be
                            necessary to deal with Spain, Portugal and Sweden since the transactions
                            with those countries are insignificant.</p>
                        <p>It is considered that Chile, Ecuador and other nations that have severed
                            diplomatic relations with the Axis are not included in Article 3,
                            dealing with neutral nations, but in Article 2.</p>
                        <p>Article 6 of the enclosed Circular vests the Superintendent of Banks with
                            broad powers to stop any financial transaction. This was considered
                            desirable in order to deal with firms who are discovered to be acting as
                            cloaks or otherwise engaging in inimical transactions but are not
                            included in the Proclaimed List.</p>

                                printed.</note> Department notes that the statement is made in the
                            airgram under reference that “a law threatens all Axis nationals with
                            the expropriation of property after May 31”. It would appear, however,
                            from your despatch 6594 [<hi rend="italic">6546</hi>] of April 12 and
                            despatch 6691 of April 29<note n="38" xml:id="d600fn38">Latter not

                            applied only to the more important Axis enterprises. The Department
                            feels that expropriation of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> Axis and
                            Proclaimed List businesses may not be necessary to achieve the desired
                            ends of control or eliminating undesirable elements, and, in fact, such
                            a result would constitute an extension of the Washington
                            Recommendations. It is suggested that you postpone urging the Peruvian
                            authorities to expropriate enterprises other than those Proclaimed List
                            firms which are clearly Axis controlled or dominated pending the receipt
                            by you of a circular instruction now being prepared in the Department
                            relating to the Proclaimed List program in Brazil.</p>
                        <p>In the interim, if you have not already done so, a classification of
                            listed firms in accordance with the circular instruction of December 17,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the Embassy’s
                            Despatch No. 6546 of April 12, 1943 reporting promulgation of the
                            Supreme Decree of April 10, 1943 which provided that all properties of
                            Proclaimed List nationals not transferred to Peruvians in accordance
                            with the provisions of Laws 9586 and 9592 by May 31, 1943 will be
                            expropriated by the State.</p>
                        <p>A Decree dated May 20, 1943, containing the Regulations of the above
                            mentioned Decree, has now been published, and copies in English and
                            Spanish are forwarded to the Department as enclosures to this
                                Despatch.<note n="40" xml:id="d601fn40">Enclosures not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>As May 31, 1943 has come and gone without any noticeable change in the
                            tempo of expropriation proceedings it is evident that we were justified
                            in awaiting developments rather than attempting to make premature
                            judgements with regard to the probable course of events. The first line
                            of Article 1 of the Regulations which reads: “A partir del 1° de junio
                            del presente año se procederá a la expropriation”, has apparently been
                            understood by the administrative officers of the Peruvian Government to
                            mean that expropriation proceedings will begin, not occur, on that date.
                            This interpretation suits the Embassy because it applies emergency
                            legislation in an orderly and judicious manner which is desirable in
                            itself to say nothing of the fact that neither the Peruvian Government
                            nor the Embassy is adequately equipped to handle transfers in any
                            greater volume than they have heretofore been presented.</p>
                        <p>In view of our previous uncertainty in this respect, the Embassy some
                            time ago decided that proof of the legitimacy of transfers of
                            businesses, which were already coming to our attention and which were
                            expected greatly to increase, would require not only extremely careful
                            scrutiny, but also in each case some kind of commitment by the
                            Superintendency of Economy itself. Accordingly the Embassy devised a
                            sort of questionnaire intended to cover all of the essential points of
                            any transaction and asked the Superintendency to submit its usual
                            reports <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0746"/>of transfers coming
                            under its jurisdiction in the form outlined. The Superintendency was not
                            only agreeable to the suggestion which was put into immediate effect but
                            went further by employing a young Peruvian of good family recently
                            graduated from Cornell to take charge of such reporting and in general
                            to act as liaison officer between the Superintendency and the Embassy in
                            connection with the transfer of Axis properties to Peruvian nationals.
                            This cooperation is working out very well and the Embassy feels that
                            substantially all of the pertinent information available to the
                            Superintendency is being properly embodied in its reports. A copy of the
                            questionnaire referred to above which forms the basis for such reports
                            is forwarded herewith as an enclosure<note n="41" xml:id="d601fn41">Not
                                printed.</note> for the Department’s information and for suggestions
                            regarding amplification of its scope if this should seem desirable. The
                            information submitted with Despatches Nos. 6792 and 6784 both of May 10,
                                1943<note n="42" xml:id="d601fn42">Neither printed.</note> represent
                            examples of the Superintendency’s replies to the first questionnaires
                            answered by that office.</p>
                        <p>There are still a number of points which the Embassy is trying to clear
                            up with the Peruvian Government—such for instance as the application of
                            the Decree of April 10 to nationalized Peruvians of Axis origin. The
                            Embassy has not taken an uncompromising stand on this question, but has
                            preferred to judge each case on its own merits so far as the phraseology
                            of Peruvian legislation and the seriousness of the Embassy’s case
                            against the individual would permit. In this respect there has been a
                            certain amount of confusion as the Peruvian Government has not pursued a
                            uniform policy. There is before us as we write an official document
                            issued by the Superintendency of Economy approving the freezing of
                            payments of purchase money to naturalized Japanese, and another official
                            ruling by the Superintendency of Banks declaring that payments to the
                            said individual should not be frozen because as a naturalized Peruvian
                            citizen he is not amenable to the freezing regulations in force. There
                            have, in fact, been a number of cases before us in which Axis subjects
                            who have become Peruvian citizens by naturalization have been considered
                            by one Department of the Government as full-fledged Peruvians while
                            being regarded by another dependency of the Government as susceptible to
                            the provisions of legislation directed against Axis individuals or
                            companies.</p>
                        <p>There are several possible solutions to these questions, and the Embassy
                            is keeping in close touch with the Superintendency of Economy in an
                            endeavor to bring about the greatest degree of uniformity in
                            expropriation procedures while seeing that serious offenders are given
                            their just deserts.</p>
                        <p>There is for instance Law 9810 of March 22, 1943 which provides that the
                            Peruvian Government will cancel the naturalization papers <pb n="733"
                                xml:id="pg_733" facs="0747"/>of any subjects of German, Italian, and
                            Japanese origin who are found guilty of subversiveactivities or
                            spreading propaganda. Many cases of such activities have occurred during
                            the last two months, but as far as is known the provisions of this law
                            have not yet been invoked in any of them. However, it is available and
                            could conceivably be of use.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, on May 24 the Superintendency of Banks published its Circular
                            No. 329 forbidding transactions with persons included in the “Black
                            List’—i.e., the Proclaimed List. This circular makes no reference to the
                            nationality of such persons although the Superintendency of Banks has
                            always maintained that Peruvian citizens included in the Proclaimed List
                            were not subject to the financial controls exercised over listed
                            non-Peruvians. This circular is of so recent a date that no confirmation
                            of the manner in which it will be administered is available. From past
                            experience we feel justified in supposing that in practice “Black
                            Listed” Peruvians will not be subjected to the same financial controls
                            as foreigners, but the ruling is official and may be of use.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has heard that a number of voluntary transfers are in
                            negotiation but is without specific information to forward at this time.
                            It is expected that a considerable volume of such data will become
                            available soon.</p>

                        <p>A–1078. Your confidential despatch no. 7676, August 21, 1943<note n="43"
                                xml:id="d602fn43">Not printed; it concerned the use of the Spanish
                                diplomatic pouch in financial transactions.</note> for the Secretary
                            and the Under Secretary. The Department appreciates the delicacy of the
                            situation and the necessity for extreme caution in any action taken in
                            this matter in order that the source of information may be protected.
                            Nevertheless, the Department views with concern any possibility that
                            attempts may be made to repatriate German funds, particularly if such
                            funds are in the form of gold or other readily marketable values
                            belonging to a Proclaimed List firm and which would be exported through
                            diplomatic channels. It is presumed that every effort is being made to
                            verify the reports in the Embassy’s despatch. The Department requests
                            that it be promptly and fully advised of all information and
                            developments in this matter.</p>
                        <pb n="734" xml:id="pg_734" facs="0748"/>
                        <p>The Department submits for the Embassy’s consideration certain courses of
                            action which may prove efficacious. First, if the existence of such gold
                            is verified and it can be traced to be the property of the Agencia
                            Martima Kosmos, a German enterprise on the Proclaimed List, the Peruvian
                            authorities might be approached and discreetly advised that the
                            Department has informed the Embassy that this company was believed to
                            have had certain gold which it had placed in the custody of the German
                            mission in Lima and which on the departure of that mission may have been
                            turned over to the Spanish Embassy.<note n="44" xml:id="d602fn44">In his
                                despatch No. 7676, August 21, the Ambassador transmitted evidence to
                                prove the truth of this report.</note> Therefore, this gold should
                            in reality be considered as an asset of an Axis enterprise and subject
                            to local controls. Accordingly the Peruvian authorities might wish to
                            conduct an investigation and take appropriate action. If in this
                            approach the Embassy would receive the cooperation of the Peruvian
                            authorities and the Spanish Ambassador were questioned about the matter,
                            it is possible that even if he claimed ignorance he would probably be
                            sufficiently apprehensive as not to attempt to export the gold.</p>
                        <p>A second course of action might be undertaken under Resolution VI of the
                            Washington Conference. In the event the position were taken that
                            whatever property was turned over to the Spanish Ambassador by the
                            departing German diplomats is regarded as official property, efforts
                            could be made to refute this position by an indication as to the origin
                            of these funds and reference could be made to Resolution VI of the
                            Washington Conference which specifies that all Axis assets, including
                                <hi rend="italic">cash</hi>, should be effectively blocked.
                            Diplomatic and official cash assets are <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                            exempt (see Department’s airgram 388 of January 27, 1943 and circular

                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>The Department requests the Embassy’s comments on the foregoing possible
                            courses of action and information as to other courses which the Embassy
                            may be considering. Obviously, the course of action to be followed would
                            be predicated on the type of information which was uncovered. However,
                            if attempts are made to export the reported gold and immediate action is
                            necessary, the Embassy is authorized to take such action as it deems
                            appropriate in the circumstances to prevent its exportation, which would
                            be inimical to the interests of the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>In connection with Axis assets, the Department has no record of having
                            received information concerning the steps which have been taken by the
                            Peruvian Government in regard to the blocking of Axis funds delivered to
                            the Spanish Embassy. The last available reference is the penultimate
                            paragraph of despatch 6305 of March 13, 1943. Please advise Department
                            of subsequent developments on this topic.</p>

                            with the Government of Peru of which numbered paragraph 3 reads as
                            follows: “The Government of the Republic of Peru shall continue to
                            administer its tax policies in such a manner as to stimulate the
                            production and free flow of strategic metals and minerals, and agrees
                            that any additional or increased taxes, fees, charges or levies which
                            may be imposed during the term hereof with respect to such metals and
                            minerals or the producers thereof shall not prevent the major portion of
                            the increases in prices provided herein from accruing to such producers.
                            It specifically agrees furthermore that no increases in export taxes or
                            fees enacted during the term of this agreement will apply to such metals
                            and minerals.”</p>

                            recent discussions. I personally have taken the matter up with the

                            agreement with Peruvian Government has been held up on account of Peru’s
                            unwillingness to agree to freeze present export taxes during the life of
                            the agreement. Numerous conversations between Ambassador Norweb and
                            Finance Minister East have been directed towards persuading Peruvian
                            Government to include clause 3 in a form acceptable to us. The Peruvian
                            Government insists on leaving the door open to put increased taxes on
                            these minerals on the assumption that we need the minerals so badly that
                            we may be induced or compelled to absorb such increases. Our position
                            has been that since we are guaranteeing the Peruvian producers a floor
                            price and a definite amount for a fixed period of time we should not
                            have to contend with possible fluctuations in production or in prices
                            due to such uncertain tax situation.</p>
                        <p>As the Peruvian contention appears to be shaping up if we sign this
                            agreement we will be putting a floor under prices paid by us for
                            Peruvian metals, but will leave the door wide open for eventual raises
                            forced upon us by increased taxation. We take the stand that this is
                            entirely out of line with our position as the sole buyer and the only
                            market for such Peruvian metals and minerals.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the delay the mineral buyers here have ceased their
                            purchases claiming that they can make no contract without knowing the
                            ultimate cost of the metal which they will eventually sell to us. This
                            situation has begun to back up towards the producers and they are now
                            beginning to feel the effects of what amounts to a buyers strike; they
                            have become alarmed and have come to us several times for suggestions
                            and advice. They have offered to take the matter up with Peruvian
                            Congressmen or direct with President Prado, or both. We have invariably
                            told them that these were matters entirely between <pb n="737"
                                xml:id="pg_737" facs="0751"/>the Peruvian Government and the
                            Peruvian people and that we were interested only in getting these
                            essential materials in the same manner as we had been obtaining them
                            from other Latin American countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Fernandini, head of the Mining Association, called on me yesterday
                            with the suggestion that perhaps article 3 of the proposed contract was
                            too strong for the Peruvian Government to accept and would I, or could
                            I, suggest the essence of this article in more acceptable terms. In view
                            of the fact we are interested only in the taxes which affect exports I
                            proposed to him the following new terms on article 3: “The Government of
                            Peru agrees not to cause any increases in present export taxes on said
                            metals and minerals and producers thereof during the life of this
                            agreement.” I realize this is a very diluted version of article 3, but
                            in view of the above do you wish us to sign the agreement without the
                            tax clause if the Peruvian Government should continue to insist upon its
                            present stand or shall we hold off on the expectation that pressure from
                            the mining groups here will force the Peruvian Government to agree to
                            some form of tax clause acceptable to us? [Thompson.]</p>

                        <p>419. Reference is made to the Embassy’s telegram 379, March 17, 11 p.m.,
                            from Thompson to Rosenthal regarding the Metals Reserve agreement. The
                            Finance Minister yesterday inquired if any news had been received from
                            Washington which we interpret as an additional indication he is rather
                            uneasy and possibly is receding from his original firm stand against
                            inclusion of the tax stabilization provision (article 3).</p>
                        <p>I am of the opinion that these protracted discussions could be ended or
                            at least shortened by a communication from Washington to the effect that
                            it seems impossible to conclude the agreement until the tax situation is
                            clarified; and this recommendation is made because it is our
                            understanding the present flow of minerals and metals from Peru is
                            satisfactory and is not retarding the war effort.</p>
                        <p>It is felt that the presentation to the Minister of such a message
                            concurrently with the pressure now being exerted on him by producers and
                            exporters might possibly influence to accept some modified wording of
                            article 3 similar to that given in telegram 379 which would accomplish
                            the desired results.</p>

                        <p>379. For Thompson from Rosenthal, BEW. Your 379, March 17. We agree to
                            necessity of obtaining assurance against an increase in export taxes and
                            approve the policy you are following.</p>
                        <p>We prefer following modification of your suggested wording of Article
                            III: “For the term of this agreement the Government of Peru agrees not
                            to cause any increases in present export taxes on strategic metals and
                            minerals. It also agrees not to impose any other taxes, fees or charges
                            which would have the effect of reducing the incentive to strategic
                            mineral production.”</p>
                        <p>If you disagree with this change or if it is unacceptable please let us

                            article 3 in telegram 379 is considered even more drastic than article 3
                            as suggested in Department’s circular telegram 104, January 29, 10 p.m.,
                            and that it would cause the Government considerable embarrassment with
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>He stated that in place of any article 3, he would prefer to write me a
                            letter incorporating the text of article 3 as cited in telegram 104
                            above omitting the last sentence thereof about freezing export taxes. He
                            asked me to inquire if this alternative procedure would be satisfactory

                            something similar to the following wording be considered: <quote

                        <p>451. For Thompson from Rosenthal, BEW. Your 466, April 1, 10 p.m.
                            Suggestion of the Finance Minister is not satisfactory, inasmuch as it
                            might permit a substantial increase in export taxes unless very strictly
                            interpreted.</p>
                        <p>We are sure that you realize and that it has been made clear to the
                            Peruvians that we have little or nothing to gain from the conclusion of
                            this over-all agreement if no provision is to be made against tax
                            increases which would have an unfavorable effect upon production. There
                            is little reason for continuing these negotiations if nothing can be
                            done with respect to this matter.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, it will be considered satisfactory if a clause is included
                            in the agreement incorporating in effect the Embassy’s suggestion in its
                            No. 466. We suggest the following wording: “If, during the term of this
                            agreement, the taxes, levies, fees or other charges imposed by the
                            Peruvian Government on the production or export of strategic metals and
                            minerals should be changed from those existing on the date of this
                            agreement, the agreement shall not continue in effect unless the
                            Governments of Peru and of the United States shall then agree to its
                            continuation for the full term.”</p>
                        <p>Please take this up with the Peruvians and advise of their reaction to
                            it. No agreement should be finally agreed to without further
                            authorization. [Rosenthal.]</p>

                        <p>617. From Rosenthal, BEW, for Thompson. Your 601, April 28, 5 p.m.<note
                                n="54" xml:id="d611fn54">Not printed.</note> and 623 May 1, 11 a.m.
                            We have discussed taxation clause with Duggan. He made no commitment to
                            urge reconsideration of Article 3, merely informing the Peruvian
                            officials that he would review the matter with us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Chavez, Commercial Attaché of the Peruvian Embassy, has submitted to
                            us the following proposed text for Article 3.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Clause A—The Government of the Republic of Peru proposes to continue
                                to administer its tax policy in such a manner as to stimulate the
                                production and free flow of strategic metals and minerals and agrees
                                that any additional or increased taxes, fees, charges, or levies
                                which may be imposed during the term hereof with respect to such
                                metals and minerals shall not prevent the major portion of the
                                increase in prices provided herein from accruing to such
                                producers.</p>
                            <p>Clause B—If during the term of this agreement the taxes, levies,
                                fees, or other charges imposed by the Peruvian Government on the
                                production or export of strategic metals and minerals should be
                                changed against the conditions of Clause A, the agreement shall not
                                continue in effect unless the Government of Peru and the United
                                States shall agree to its continuation for the full term.”</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>We have submitted to Chavez a modification of this omitting words
                            “continue to” and deleting all after “shall not” in Clause A
                            substituting “shall not be of such a nature as to interfere with the
                            accomplishment of that purpose”. No change in Clause B.</p>
                        <p>Chavez agreed to submit this proposal to Lima but objected to our
                            substitution at end of Clause A. His position apparently was that his
                            Government would wish to retain this implied recognition of their right
                            to tax up to 49 percent of any increase in price and that they wanted
                            the right to as “favorable” taxation as that allowed any other Latin
                            American Government. He referred specifically to the Chilean
                            Extraordinary Tax on copper which takes the first one and onequarter
                            cents per pound out of any increase up to two and one-half cents.</p>
                        <p>Our position, as explained to Chavez, is that our revision of his clause
                            is the least restrictive yet proposed and that we do not wish it to
                            contain a phrase which might limit the effect of the clear expression of
                            intent. We would consider any increase in export tax a violation of that
                            expression.</p>
                        <p>Any export tax is a direct deterrent to mineral production. Any increase
                            or likelihood of increase, even though from a low level, can <pb n="741"
                                xml:id="pg_741" facs="0755"/>seriously curtail production and
                            exploration to the prejudice of the war effort.</p>
                        <p>We do not intend article 3 to limit ability of Peruvian Government to
                            obtain additional revenue if necessary by means of income or similar
                            taxes which will not have an adverse effect on production.</p>
                        <p>We point out that the level of taxes in other countries should not be
                            used for comparison. Conditions vary too greatly from country to
                            country. Some countries, such as Mexico, have agreed to more rigid
                            restrictions than we are asking of Peru. Others already had a
                            restrictive tax structure. We could not ask them to reduce taxes nor are
                            we asking Peru to do so.</p>
                        <p>While wishing to avoid comparisons, we did point out to Mr. Chavez
                            certain special considerations regarding the Chilean Extraordinary Tax
                            which had apparently been overlooked.</p>

                                profits. Chagres and Natalgua which buy ores from small producers
                                were specifically exempt. It could not have such an adverse effect
                                on production as a tax applied against a marginal producer.</item>

                            transferred to Washington. If resumed in Lima please make our views
                            clear to Peruvians and attempt to obtain inclusion of Article 3 as
                            outlined above. We prefer this to any previous texts. We also prefer
                            that negotiation of balance of agreement be concluded in Lima.</p>
                        <p>Your present instructions with respect to copper ores and concentrates
                            are to offer a price based on 11.75 cents New York. The price in the
                            original Chilean Overall was calculated from the same base. For your
                            information, in August 1942 the Chileans were granted an increase of 5
                            percent in the case of copper concentrates and 10 percent in the case of
                            copper ores. Another identical increase of 5 percent and 10 percent of
                            the original price has been authorized subject to the discretion of our
                            representatives in Chile.</p>
                        <p>We may grant the first Chilean increase to Hochschild and Grace in Peru
                            on renewal of their contracts now being negotiated. If you are unable to
                            obtain acceptance in the overall of the price based on 11.75 cents
                            please send your recommendations as to how we might grant an improved
                            price without diverting copper ores and concentrates from Cerro de Pasco
                            and possibly without having to pay the improved price to Northern Peru
                            Mining Company. In this connection you may wish to point out to the
                            Peruvians that the prices <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0756"/>in
                            the overall are floor prices which we may exceed in special cases such
                            as Hochschild and Grace, when circumstances warrant.</p>
                        <p>Embassy’s cable 601 asks whether negotiations can proceed without further
                            reference to Washington. Original instructions were to submit to us
                            final draft before signing. In view of the time elapsed since the
                            discussions were begun and possibility of resultant misunderstandings,
                            we prefer that those instructions be adhered to. Please keep us informed
                            of progress in negotiations. [Rosenthal.]</p>

                        <p>892. Reference Department’s telegram 704, June 19, 8 p.m. Finance
                            Minister yesterday accepted clauses A and B including modification of
                            clause A as proposed by BEW in telegram 617 of May 28, 10 p.m.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated he accepted clauses A and B of article 3
                            unconditionally including their publication as a part of the agreement
                            if <pb n="743" xml:id="pg_743" facs="0757"/>Washington definitely
                            insists upon such publication. He would prefer, however, and requested
                            that I submit his suggestion that clauses A and B of article 3 be
                            included in a separate exchange of letters.</p>

                            However, as stated above, the Minister has not stipulated this as a

                            While we are agreed that the results of that trip have been
                            satisfactory, the perennial Peruvian debt question is apparently no
                            nearer a solution than it was a year ago. You are, of course, thoroughly
                            familiar with all of the details of this situation but I would like to
                            recall the statement in the press release of April 23, 1942 concerning
                            Dasso’s visit which refers to the debt: “He has also stated that he is
                            engaged in discussions with the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council,
                            Inc. looking towards a resumption of payments on the Peruvian dollar

                            reasonable offer to the bondholders cannot help but adversely affect the
                            friendly and cooperative relationship which has been so painstakingly
                            built up between our two countries and which we all, of course, will do
                            everything to maintain. It seems to me that the question can be put up
                            to the President in a very firm way in view of the relatively good
                            financial position in which the Peruvian Government now finds

                            take an early opportunity to discuss the question again with President
                            Prado, but I would like to have your comment upon subsequent paragraphs
                            of this letter. It would be especially helpful if your reply could reach
                            me during the time that Mr. Wallace and Larry Duggan will be in
                            Lima—from April eleventh to fourteenth.<note n="67" xml:id="d616fn67"

                        <p>There are, I believe, three contributing factors of importance which
                            affect this debt settlement. Peru has a notoriously bad reputation for
                            meeting its financial obligations. The dollar loans still are associated
                            with the Leguía<note n="68" xml:id="d616fn68">Agusto Leguía y Salcedo,
                                President of Peru from 1919 to 1930.</note> régime and, although the
                            feeling against that régime no longer is acute, a resumption of service
                            on the bonds will be unpopular from the point of view of internal
                            politics. Finally, we ourselves have failed to definitely tie up our
                            substantial financial and economic aid to Peru with a specific
                            commitment concerning service on the dollar bonds.</p>
                        <p>Cooperation in our economic warfare program and in continental defense
                            have been my two major preoccupations in Peru. Next in importance has
                            come the settlement of various debts and claims. I have discussed the
                            dollar bonds, the postal debt, and various private claims repeatedly
                            with the President and with Cabinet Ministers. Julian Greenup<note

                            the Embassy strongly recommended that the extension of financial and
                            economic aid on our part be made contingent upon action by Peru to meet
                            its obligations. It was pointed out that Dasso, as a practical business
                            man, would expect and agree to such dealing. There are many other
                            Peruvian business men who admit that Peru should be forced to make an
                            arrangement, that Peruvians will not like paying but that they will do
                            so and will respect us for insisting <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747"
                                facs="0761"/>upon payment. The commitment made by Dasso in
                            Washington with respect to the debt was a very tenuous one. Something
                            might have come of it, even so, had he been able to continue in office
                            as Minister of Finance.</p>
                        <p>When I was in Washington last November, I discussed the dollar debt
                            question in the Department, suggesting that a representative of the
                            Foreign Bondholders Protective Council be sent to Lima to follow up the
                            Dasso commitment. My impression was that the Department still did not
                            wish to consider the question as one between the two Governments. I am
                            convinced that our Government is going to have to enter the picture in
                            some way if we are to obtain payment from Peru.</p>
                        <p>You may wish to read my despatch no. 6471, dated April 1, 1943,<note

                            dollar bonds. Warren told David Dasso and Julio East<note n="72"
                                xml:id="d616fn72">Peruvian Minister of Finance.</note> that some
                            definite action on the dollar debt probably would have to be taken
                            before the Export-Import Bank could do any extensive financing of
                            projects in Peru. These projects are of special interest to President
                            Prado. Dasso and East immediately agreed, stated that action should have
                            been taken long ago, and East promised prompt attention to the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>The way has been paved for another approach to President Prado. My idea
                            is to review the entire situation with Larry Duggan when he reaches
                            Lima. I then will talk with the President. I can refer to Pierson’s
                            conversations with Dasso and East and to the definite promises made by
                            the two latter. Then, I believe, I should suggest that President Prado
                            have an official request made for a representative of the Foreign
                            Bondholders Protective Council to come to Lima for the purpose of
                            reaching an immediate agreement for the resumption of service on the
                            dollar debt. Perhaps the visit of the Council’s representative could be
                            postponed for a short time provided the Peruvian Government immediately
                            will make a reasonable offer to the bondholders. All of this presupposes
                            that the Department is going to participate in the negotiations at least
                            to the extent of directly arranging for the officials of the Peruvian
                            Government and of the Council to get together and to keep at it until a
                            settlement has been reached.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Harry</hi>: Your letter of April 6 only reached
                            me on April 14. I am therefore unable to send you any reply to your
                            observations concerning the Peruvian foreign debt question to reach you
                            during Mr. Wallace’s visit.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that we must give a firm indication to President Prado
                            that (1) the degree to which the United States can cooperate financially
                            with Peru is dependent upon the existence in the United States of a
                            public opinion favoring our present inter-American policy; (2) that the
                            maintenance of this state of public opinion depends in part upon the
                            treatment accorded the legitimate interests of our citizens in the other
                            American republics; and (3) that this Government considers the
                            aspirations of American citizens to a fair settlement of the
                            indebtedness of the Peruvian Government to them as a very definite
                            legitimate interest.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that it would be a serious mistake for us to tie any
                            specific foreign debt settlement to any specific measure of economic
                            cooperation. For a variety of reasons, including that of political
                            expediency, I think we wish to avoid any semblance of a clear cut
                            bargain. On the other hand, we are prepared to make it clear that the
                            whole trend of our economic policy toward Peru is by no means
                            independent of and is, in fact, highly sensitive to the trend of Peru’s
                            policy toward the interests of our citizens.</p>
                        <p>I realize that it may be difficult for a business man like Dasso fully to
                            understand the type of policy which I have outlined. Nevertheless it is
                            the only one which we as a Government can afford in the long run to
                            follow.</p>
                        <p>As I believe you have been informed, the Foreign Bondholders Protective
                            Council recently addressed a communication to the Peruvian Finance
                            Minister which will, I hope, furnish an opportunity for a constructive
                            reopening of this matter.</p>
                        <p>Believe me</p>

                            and requesting the Embassy’s comment, together with the latest available
                            information on the likelihood of Peru’s making some early adjustment of
                            its defaulted dollar indebtedness.</p>
                        <p>The statements of the Finance Minister in his letter of May 5 convey the
                            same information given to me by the Minister at about the same date.
                            Although the subject has come up in subsequent conversations, the

                            declining revenues in certain chapters of the Budget, together with the
                            dislocations, or at least uncertainty, in foreign trade render it
                            impossible for the Peruvian Government immediately to arrive at any
                            concrete proposal for renewing service on the dollar debt. He has
                            reiterated, however, that Peru recognizes the importance of restoring in
                            the United States its reputation of meeting its obligation promptly. He
                            has stated also that the Government continues to give attention to this
                            protracted topic and plans to submit proposals at the earliest
                            opportunity.</p>

                        <p>881. From the Under Secretary. The failure of the Peruvian authorities to
                            fulfil their assurances regarding the dollar funded debt is viewed by
                            the Department with increasing concern. The Embassy is aware of the
                            repeated assurances given by Peruvian officials, including Finance
                            Minister Dasso in April 1942, that some action in this matter would soon
                            be taken by the Peruvian Government. Those assurances have been almost
                            completely ignored. The continuance of such a Peruvian attitude will
                            have a cumulative effect in weakening the favorable public opinion in
                            this country upon which financial and economic collaboration by the
                            United States with Peru is in the last analysis based.</p>
                        <pb n="750" xml:id="pg_750" facs="0764"/>
                        <p>Please call upon President Prado and stress the importance, for the
                            reasons stated, of positive action by the Peruvian Government to adjust
                            these obligations on an equitable basis. It is noted that the financial
                            position of Peru is stronger than in April 1942 when Dasso’s assurances
                            were given. [Welles.]</p>

                            statement, reported in my despatch No. 7409 of July 20<note n="75"
                                xml:id="d620fn75">Not printed.</note> and repeated in his annual
                            message to Congress, was a result. In paraphrase he said: “We have
                            totally cancelled many foreign obligations, no foreign loans have been
                            floated and the settlement of the foreign debt is under study depending
                            on the goodwill of our creditors to reach an honest and equitable
                            agreement. No part of the credit opened 3 years ago by the Export-Import
                            Bank for $25,000,000 has been used”.<note n="76" xml:id="d620fn76">See

                            informed me he would discuss the subject with the Finance Minister who

                            installments. Although there is no budgetal provision for payment of the
                            postal debt he proposes to sell public works bonds in an amount
                            sufficient to effect the full payment.<note n="77" xml:id="d620fn78">In
                                despatch No. 7665, August 20, 1943, the Ambassador reported that the
                                Minister contemplated selling the bonds on the open market in
                                sufficient amount to cover the agreed postal debt to the United
                                States of $308,000 (811.71223/57).</note></p>
                        <p>Accordingly there seems to be some sound basis for belief that the
                            President and associated Peruvian authorities are giving serious thought
                            to the problem of regularizing the financial position of the Government.
                            Consequently strengthened by your telegram under <pb n="751"

                            two ago by Finance Minister East.</p>
                        <p>Mr. East again mentioned the President had requested him to investigate
                            thoroughly. He stated also he would endeavor to have something available
                            for me to carry to the United States on my coming trip. Failing that, he
                            will try to forward a report to me in Washington in order to permit the
                            fullest possible discussion of the subject at this time.</p>
                        <p>He did, however, express a preference for dealing with the problem more
                            comprehensively and submitting a more complete statement toward the end
                            of the year. This proposal, of course, represents yet another effort to
                            prolong negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Should other developments become available before my departure, the
                            Department will be informed accordingly.</p>

                                brother of the former Finance Minister.</note> Finance Minister

                        <p>The reaction of the personalities hitherto approached is not conducive to
                            a belief that in the absence of something more forceful than oral
                            persuasion, the Peruvian Government is likely to propose, or to assent
                            to a proposition conducive to, settlement of bonded indebtedness <pb
                                n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0768"/>in a sense acceptable to the
                            Foreign Bondholders Protective Council.</p>
                        <p>For instance, Minister East … observed that at the time of Mr.
                            McCormick’s expected visit he would probably be extremely busy preparing
                            his Ministry’s budget for presentation to the Peruvian Congress, the
                            ordinary session of which terminates on November 27. Upon my remarking
                            that this very time seemed opportune for a visit of a representative of
                            the Bondholders Council and that Minister East would be in a position to
                            add to his budget a subdivision for settlement of the outstanding dollar
                            bonds, Minister East smiled and made no further observation.</p>
                        <p>Again, I had a talk at some length with Mr. David Dasso at a social
                            reunion, at which time I mentioned his visit to the United States in the
                            spring of 1942, and the confidence apparently placed at Washington in
                            assurances given by him at that time on matters of interest to the
                            Peruvian and United States Governments including outstanding bonds of
                            United States citizens. To this Mr. Dasso replied that he regretted that
                            a beginning had not been made toward settlement of this bonded
                            indebtedness but at the same time remarked that he considered the
                            bondholders, then represented by Mr. White,<note n="84"
                                xml:id="d623fn84">Francis White.</note> ill-advised in having
                            summarily turned down a proposal made by Mr. Dasso to begin interest
                            payments at the rate of 1% per annum. On my remarking that this seemed a
                            very small beginning and inquiring if he had proposed anything for
                            amortization of the principal, Mr. Dasso replied negatively, stating
                            that while his suggestion was indeed modest it recorded a willingness of
                            the Peruvian Government to recognize the existence of the outstanding
                            dollar debt. Continuing, Mr. Dasso stated that the Peruvian sense of
                            obligation toward the debt had been somewhat impaired by a variety of
                            facts or alleged facts including rumors of illicit bonuses paid by the
                            representatives of the banks negotiating the loans in Peru …; the
                            receipt by Peru of a figure well under the original market price of the
                            bonds; the transfer of bonds into other than the hands of the original
                            holders including bank interests in New York which had bought them up
                            cheaply.</p>
                        <p>From observations such as those outlined above it seems apparent that
                            influential Peruvians who probably are in a position to interpret the
                            attitude of the Peruvian Government do not believe in the existence of a
                            strong sense of responsibility on the part of the authorities in this
                            country to effect a serious approach to the debt problem at the present
                            time. However, it is admitted that Peruvian finances are now in an
                            excellent state. Despite this fact there is evidently little interest in
                            liquidating, or even beginning to settle, an indebtedness which was
                            contracted under a régime now defunct and discredited.</p>
                        <pb n="755" xml:id="pg_755" facs="0769"/>
                        <p>It has moreover been remarked that should approach toward settlement of
                            the problem be made, it is hardly conceivable that the Peruvians would
                            consent to more favorable terms than those under which Mexican
                            indebtedness to United States interests is understood to have been
                            assumed by a syndicate of American bankers<note n="85" xml:id="d623fn85"

                            outstanding principal debt is stated to have been scaled down by of 5/6
                            its original total. At the same time, it is admitted that too
                            advantageous a settlement from the Peruvian standpoint may well impair
                            this country’s future credit.</p>

                        <p>1335. The Department refers to its telegram 1188 of October 26, 9
                                p.m.,<note n="86" xml:id="d624fn86">Not printed.</note> and to your
                            airgram A–1537, November 12, concerning the defaulted Peruvian
                            dollar-bonded indebtedness.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCormick found it necessary to return urgently to the United States
                            from Rio de Janeiro and it has been decided that in his stead Mr. Lee
                            Orton, who was Mr. McCormick’s co-negotiator at Rio de Janeiro, will
                            visit La Paz and Lima in connection with the dollar-bonded indebtedness
                            of Bolivia and Peru. Mr. Orton is now in La Paz and is scheduled to
                            arrive at Lima December 9. Tentatively he intends to leave Lima on
                            December 15. If, however, the occasion seems propitious, he will either
                            remain longer or he and/or Mr. McCormick will return.</p>
                        <p>The Department attaches first importance to the early adjustment of the
                            Peruvian dollar-bonded indebtedness now long in default. So strongly
                            does the Department feel on the subject that I today requested the
                            Peruvian Ambassador<note n="87" xml:id="d624fn87">Manuel de Freyre y
                                Santander.</note> to call on me in this connection. I handed him the
                            following memorandum: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Strong feeling exists in both governmental and private circles

                                <p>“Subsequent to Señor Dasso’s visit (now 19 months past) several
                                    conversations on this subject have been held by Ambassador
                                    Norweb and members of his staff with Peruvian officials in Lima
                                    and there has been correspondence on the subject between the
                                    Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, Incorporated, and the
                                    Peruvian Government. There is marked disappointment that no
                                    adjustment has resulted, particularly when bondholders had been
                                    encouraged that a settlement was impending and when it was
                                    public knowledge that the financial condition of Peru lent
                                    itself to a resumption of service.</p>
                                <p>“Certainly the financial situation of Peru has improved markedly
                                    (even in comparison with the situation at the time of Señor
                                    Dasso’s visit to the United States in April 1942). Bondholders
                                    in the United States are, of course, aware of this favorable
                                    fiscal position and of the foreign exchange reserves which have
                                    resulted from extensive purchases of strategic materials which
                                    have been and are now being made by the United States in Peru.
                                    It is felt that the time is propitious for an early settlement
                                    of these defaulted bond issues and such action by Peru would be
                                    considered as another forward step in the reciprocal cooperation
                                    which characterizes inter-American relations. Failure to resume
                                    active negotiations looking to the resumption of service on
                                    these dollar bonds would not be understood in the United States
                                    and it would react unfavorably not only in financial circles,
                                    but also among the large body of holders of these defaulted
                                    bonds who are scattered widely throughout the population of the
                                    United States.</p>

                                    receive Mr. Orton at that time and utilize this visit to resume
                                    active negotiations looking to an early permanent
                                    adjustment.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that I did not mean to be blunt in referring to
                            this question, but that speaking in a friendly tone and manner, I felt
                            obliged to say that Mr. Orton, representing the Foreign Bondholders
                            Protective Council, had visited Brazil in an endeavor to effect a debt
                            settlement; that after the attention of Brazil was brought fully to bear
                            on the complicated and long overdue debt situation and the great benefit
                            which would accrue to both countries upon adjustment, a full settlement
                            of the debt situation had been worked out which placed the situation on
                            a business basis in a manner beneficial to both countries. I told the
                            Ambassador that Mr. Orton would be in Lima on December 9 for a similar
                            discussion with the Peruvian Government. It was my earnest hope that the
                            Peruvian Government, might see its way clear likewise to bring about a
                            complete adjustment <pb n="757" xml:id="pg_757" facs="0771"/>of the debt
                            matter and in that connection emphasized the mutual benefit which would
                            accrue to both countries and especially to Peru. The Ambassador said he
                            was really glad to have me call attention to this matter; that he had
                            not long since taken the matter up with his Government and had urged
                            that Peru from the standpoint of its own interest should not neglect
                            these debt matters. The Ambassador seemed wholly sympathetic throughout
                            and said that he would transmit the message to his Government.</p>
                        <p>You may in your discretion make available to the appropriate authorities
                            a copy of the memorandum which I handed to the Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>Please render Mr. Orton all appropriate assistance and keep in close
                            touch with the Department by telegraph.</p>

                        <p>A–1255. Referring to Department’s telegram no. 869 of August 3, Messrs.
                            Keyes Metcalf, Wilmarth Lewis and Lewis Hanke, representing the
                            Committee in Aid of the National Library of Peru, arrived in Lima August
                            11 and left August 22.</p>
                        <p>They conferred with individuals and groups interested in the Library and
                            the Geographical Society, interviewing President Prado, the Ministers of
                            Foreign Affairs and Education;<note n="95" xml:id="d629fn95">Alfredo
                                Solf y Muro and Enrique Lareza, respectively.</note> the new
                            librarian Dr. Basadre, the librarians of the lesser libraries, Dr.
                            Morales Macedo, the reorganizer of the Geographical Society, and
                            others.</p>
                        <p>Their recommendations will take the following main trends: One Peruvian
                            architect and three Peruvian librarians to go north for short
                            orientation trips; three U.S. librarians and three U.S. assistants to
                            come south to aid in library school in Lima; organization of books in
                            the U.S. to be checked according to Dr. Basadre’s needs; amassing of
                            U.S. Government publications, amassing of photostats and microfilms of
                            Peruvian MS in U.S. collections; special gifts to be considered
                            later.</p>
                        <p>The Committee were a great success technically, intellectually and
                            socially, and the interest taken in their visit was broader than the
                            immediate importance of their mission. Their tact and understanding
                            seemed to increase cooperation among various groups that have
                            experienced difficulty in pulling together. Immediate reaction indicated
                            that aid to the Library is one of the most important moves the U.S. can
                            make to strengthen our cultural relations with Peru. It will be concrete
                            evidence of our good will in this field of cooperation.</p>

                            Embassy’s above-mentioned despatch. The Officer in Chargé is informed
                            that $20,000 has been allocated to the National Library of Peru under
                            the “Books for Latin America Project” which is being administered for
                            the Department by the American Library Association. Orders for United
                            States publications can be placed by Dr. Basadre against this allocation
                            through the Washington office of the American Library Association.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that Dr. Basadre will select the publications to be
                            ordered in view of the fact that he is familiar with the needs of the
                            library. Book lists will be sent to Dr. Basadre to provide
                            bibliographical aids in selecting the publications. If the lists which
                            are being sent are not sufficient, further information will be furnished
                            upon request.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the Department has been informed that a complete set of the
                            catalogs of United States Government publications has already been
                            presented to Dr. Basadre. The Department will endeavor to obtain
                            whatever official publications are selected from these lists.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the Officer in Charge will wish to make an official
                            announcement of this gift of books to the Peruvian government.</p>

                            transportation in Montevideo is decidedly questionable in view of

                                    resulting from conversions to electricity but fails to take into
                                    account corresponding increases in power plant

                        <p>153. For Thornburg from Clover. Department’s 79 of January 28. Experience
                            since the formation of the Embassy’s original estimate of Uruguay’s
                            essential requirements detailed in Montevideo telegram 617 of July 23,
                                1942,<note n="9" xml:id="d632fn9">Not printed.</note> has confirmed
                            that 62% of 1941 is substantially correct inclusive of all war essential
                            activities and to this extent the Embassy agrees with the contention of
                            Guani and Giorgi that this quantity should be supplied.</p>
                        <p>Montevideo telegram 640 of July 31, 1942, in reply to Department’s
                            telegram 462 of July 29, 1942,<note n="10" xml:id="d632fn10">Neither
                                printed.</note> recommended that any attempt to reclassify any
                            industries as war essential be deferred until after some months of
                            experience with 62% rationed in accordance with the decree of July 28,
                            1942, and stated that the Rationing Committee was told to request
                            reclassifications when the need developed. Unfortunately for Uruguay,
                            the Department could not accept the 62% basis.</p>
                        <p>On September 11, 1942, in note 195 the Embassy informed the Uruguayan
                            Government that the basic ration available was 40% of the 1941
                            consumption and that this made it advisable that the Rationing Committee
                            should recommend to the Embassy without delay their determination of the
                            needs of the war essential industries as a category to be supplied
                            outside of the Uruguayan economy. This was not done, but the Embassy did
                            not press the reclassifications because local rationing measures were
                            not enforced to the extent necessary to hold consumption within visible
                            supplies and it appeared salutary to let a stock shortage develop
                            without further Embassy interference and thus demonstrate unmistakably
                            the fact that tanker tonnage really was limited. In December the
                            inevitable happened, stocks became practically exhausted, and rationing
                            is now realistic.</p>
                        <p>Therefore the Embassy initiated reclassification studies and made the
                            recommendations included in the Embassy’s A–15, January 12, 1943.<note
                                n="9" xml:id="d632fn11">Not printed.</note> These were based upon
                            statistics where available and estimates of informed persons where no
                            figures were obtainable and all evaluated by Clover on the basis that
                            40% was the civilian ration and only justifiable exceptions meaning war
                            essential industry requirements would be allowed.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy recommends that extra allotments be limited to the amounts
                            and categories named in the Embassy’s A–15 and other cases already
                            submitted with the understanding that additional war essential requests
                            will be considered as the need is demonstrated.</p>

                        <p>Questions in the Department’s telegram 79, May 24, 9 a.m. [<hi

                        <list>
                            <item>First, yes;</item>
                            <item>Second, our analysis was based upon 1941 consumption plus
                                individual needs in 1943 of war essential industries. We made it
                                emphatically clear to the rationing committee that the 40% civilian
                                quota was the quantity allocated by the military authorities who had
                                conscripted all tankers and had no direct relation to the needs of
                                the South American countries but was determined solely by what could
                                be released from our direct war effort. For this reason increased
                                power plant needs are not relevant.</item>
                            <item>Third, theoretically the refinery losses would be saved but the
                                loss in flexibility might necessitate carrying greater stocks of
                                finished products which would cancel part of the gain. Politically
                                the shutting down of the refinery would be an unfortunate necessity
                                which the Embassy would prefer to avoid.</item>
                            <item>Fourth, the local pool committee supports the efforts of the
                                Uruguayan mission. The Embassy was not consulted.</item>
                            <item>Fifth, the Embassy supports fully the Uruguayan presentation of
                                Uruguayan requirements but takes the position that the war
                                requirements and not the Uruguayan necessities are the deciding
                                factor.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Our A–15 and other individual cases already submitted have given as
                            liberal an interpretation of war essential requirements as the Embassy
                            feels justified in making, although other cases may arise later.

                        <p>108. Department’s 79, January 28 and Embassy’s 153, January 30. In a
                            memorandum handed to Dr. Giorgi on February 3, 1943 concerning Uruguayan
                            oil requirements, a copy of which has been sent you by air mail, the
                            Department indicated that an additional quantity of oil totaling
                            approximately 34,000 tons per year for essential uses has been made
                            available to Uruguay. It was also indicated that detailed information
                            concerning the additional requirements presented by Foreign Minister
                            Guani and Dr. Giorgi for power plant fuel oil and domestic kerosene
                            would be obtained from the committee in Uruguay in order that those
                            amounts also may be taken into account.</p>
                        <p>The above-mentioned approximate total of 34,000 tons includes the 2,500
                            tons per month (30,000 per year), recommended in your A–15, January
                                12<note n="11" xml:id="d633fn11">Not printed.</note> and the 3,000

                                facs="0780"/>committee has already been instructed to supply
                            Frigorifico Artigas (your telegram no. 3, January 2<note n="12"
                                xml:id="d633fn12">The reference is to telegram No. 3, January 2,

                            instructed to make the 2,500 tons per month available to Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>The Department wishes you to consider the above-mentioned additional
                            requirements, presented by Foreign Minister Guani and Dr. Giorgi, for
                            power plant fuel oil and domestic kerosene, which were listed as 5,000
                            tons and 1,908 tons, respectively, in the Department’s telegram under
                            reference, as though they had been presented in accordance with the
                            usual pool procedure, and telegraph your views for presentation to the
                            Essential Requirements Committee. The Department also wishes similar
                            consideration given to the request for additional supplies for the
                            National Frigorifico, which had not previously been presented and which
                            is included with Artigas in the Department’s telegram under
                            reference.</p>
                        <p>Please endeavor to ensure that the Uruguayan authorities concerned
                            clearly understand the proper method for the presentation of any further
                            requests, and reiterate that the basic pool formula continues to be 40
                            percent of 1941 civilian consumption plus approved essentials with
                            deliveries contingent upon the vicissitudes of war. It is most important
                            that Uruguay, as well as the other countries concerned, does not have
                            the impression that it is receiving any fixed percentage (such as 62
                            percent) other than the basic 40 percent plus essentials.</p>

                        <p>211. Department’s 108, February 9. Based on maintaining 40% plus
                            essentials basis the Embassy recommends that the following extra monthly
                            quantities be allotted: National Frigorificos 700 tons kerosene for
                            farmers and laborers producing exports 1500 tons fuel oil for power
                            plant 2000 tons National Frigorificos is exporting approximately 60% of
                            their production; their 40% basic quota is 325 tons a month; we estimate
                            their minimum to maintain exports is 1025 or 700 extra.</p>

                            other basic uses such as water supply and sewage pumps. The failure of
                            the Argentine corn crop has cut off further supplies of this fuel which
                            necessitates replacement at least temporarily by the quantity of fuel

                        <p>152. Your 211, February 13, 1943. The Supply Committee for Latin America
                            will be instructed to make available to Uruguay an additional amount of
                            2,000 tons of fuel oil per month, which corresponds to the additional
                            amount you recommended to meet the essential needs of the power plant,
                            and also 700 tons per month for the National Frigorifico. With respect
                            to the latter, however, the Essential Requirements Committee is of the
                            opinion that supplies for both the National Frigorifico and Frigorifico
                            Artigas should be regulated in accordance with any seasonal variation in
                            their operations, and the Supply Committee for Latin America will be
                            instructed to advise the local pool committee accordingly.</p>
                        <p>From the information now available, the Essential Requirements Committee
                            does not consider that the supplying of kerosene for farmers and
                            laborers is an essential requirement and therefore, in accordance with
                            pool principles, an additional quantity will not be made available for
                            that purpose.</p>
                        <p>You should inform the appropriate Uruguayan officials of the foregoing
                            and explain that, in accordance with the memorandum handed to Dr. Giorgi
                            on February 3, 1943.<note n="14" xml:id="d635fn14">Memorandum not

                            ascertained to be essential requirements, will be made available to
                            Uruguay in addition to the total amount indicated in that memorandum and

                        <p>341. A conference was held in the Department on June 21 with
                            representatives of the Petroleum Supply Committee for Latin America and
                            of the Office of the Petroleum Administrator for War participating. The
                            Supply Committee and the Petroleum Administrator’s representative
                            stressed the importance of obtaining a <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi> between the marketing companies and Ancap before the
                            present agreement expires on June 30, 1943. This would give sufficient
                            time to discuss the problem more fully with Ancap and with the Uruguayan
                            authorities and obviate the necessity of the Committee’s being
                            confronted with what it considers a rather serious threat to the spirit
                            and principles of the supply pool. The matter has been discussed in
                            detail with Ambassador Dawson, who is now en route to Montevideo, and it
                            is desired that he conduct the negotiations personally once he returns.
                            However, owing to the fact that only a few days remain until the
                            agreement expires, it may be necessary that preliminary discussions be
                            carried on by you prior to the Ambassador’s arrival. Therefore, (and
                            depending on the outcome of the inquiries referred to in your 594 of
                            June 17,<note n="15" xml:id="d636fn15">Not printed.</note> and provided
                            you consider it advisable) you are authorized to communicate informally
                            to the appropriate Uruguayan authorities the following considerations,
                            reporting fully to the Department by telegraph: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>In accordance with its well known policy this Government has of
                                    course no desire or intention of interposing in any domestic
                                    matter such as the implementation of legislation governing the
                                    extension of Ancap’s monopoly. At the same time in view of
                                    present world conditions the Department feels that this might
                                    not be an opportune time in either the general interest or that
                                    of Uruguay for any action which might have an adverse effect on
                                    the petroleum pool arrangement which, the Department believes,
                                    has operated in a manner advantageous to Uruguay. It may be
                                    pointed out in this connection that the Supply Committee was
                                    organized and functions with the voluntary participation of the
                                    various interests concerned including of course the petroleum
                                    companies and that a basic principle was that the companies’
                                    relative commercial positions would be frozen for the duration
                                    of the pool arrangement.</p>

                        <p>617. Reference Department’s 341, June 23, 7 p.m. As required by Uruguayan
                            protocol, I obtained permission from Foreign Office to discuss
                            informally petroleum matter with appropriate Uruguayan officials as
                            authorized in Department’s 321 [<hi rend="italic">341</hi>]. The British
                            Minister requested and was also granted similar permission and Foreign
                            Office made appointment for us to call jointly upon President Ruiz of
                            newly appointed board directors of Ancap. We mentioned to Ruiz concern
                            of foreign companies as respects their position and requested an
                            expression of the views of appropriate authorities with respect to
                            situation and possible renewal of present agreement. Ruiz replied that
                            Directorate had just few days ago taken over and although it was aware
                            that contract existed between Ancap and foreign companies it had not had
                            opportunity to study question of renewal. He assured me that he would
                            inform board of our visit which he expected to do today and observed
                            that in view of short period remaining it might have to consider
                            arrangement for renewal of contract.</p>
                        <p>In view now of the Department’s 341 and fact that Ambassador will not
                            arrive here until 29th I shall seek interview with Ruiz tomorrow and
                            convey to him the considerations embodied in last paragraph of cited

                            private petroleum companies operating in Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>As stated in the Department’s telegram no. 341 of June 23, 1943 this
                            Government has no desire or intention of interposing in any Uruguayan
                            domestic matter such as the implementation of the legislation giving
                            Ancap a monopoly over sales of petroleum products in Uruguay and the
                            Department does not now wish to be placed in a position of supporting a
                            long-term renewal of the present marketing agreement between the Ancap
                            and the private companies, which support might be construed as
                            unwarranted interference of this nature. At the same time, the marketing
                            agreement currently in force is intimately connected with the operation
                            of the Latin American pool arrangement and the Department feels that in
                            the general interest of the war effort of the United Nations as well as
                            in that of Uruguay no action should be taken which might disturb the
                            successful operation of the petroleum pool. Accordingly, as the occasion
                            arises, the Embassy should lend its good offices in informal support of
                            such temporary renewals of the present marketing agreement as may be
                            necessary to maintain the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> for the
                            duration of the war emergency, or for as long as the Latin American
                            petroleum pool may remain in being. While the length of time such
                            temporary renewal or renewals might cover is a matter for negotiation
                            between Ancap and the private companies, the Department feels that an
                            extension of the agreement for a period up to two years would not be
                            excessive from the point of view of the general interest.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department refers to its instruction
                            no. 1650 of September 29, 1943 concerning the renewal of the marketing
                            agreement between the Ancap and the private petroleum companies
                            operating in Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>There is now enclosed a memorandum of conversation<note n="17"
                                xml:id="d640fn17">Not printed.</note> held in the Department with
                            Messrs. Ralph W. Bolton and H. A. Metzger of the Standard Oil Company.
                            You will note therefrom that the private companies plan to suggest in
                            the forth-coming negotiations that the renewed contract run for some
                            three years to terminate coincidental <pb n="771" xml:id="pg_771"
                                facs="0785"/>with the end of office of the present Uruguayan
                            administration, February 28, 1947. The Department feels that there might
                            be certain general advantages in such an arrangement which would appeal
                            to the Ancap as well as to the private companies and that it would
                            furnish adequate insurance for the present at least against disturbance
                            of the war-time Latin American petroleum pool.</p>
                        <p>In requesting you to lend your informal support to enable the achievement
                            of an agreement consistent with the best interests of the war effort,
                            the Department suggested in its instruction under reference that, while
                            the length of time the renewal agreement might cover was a matter for
                            negotiation among the principals, a period of two years would not be
                            excessive. In doing so the Department wished to make a clear distinction
                            between a six months’ period and one of a reasonable length in relation
                            to the possible duration of the pool arrangements and the Department has
                            of course no objection to the three year period now desired by the
                            private companies provided it meets with the approval of the various
                            Uruguayan entities involved.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s strictly confidential instructions nos. 1650 and 1706 of
                            September 29 and October 23, 1943, respectively, concerning the renewal
                            of the marketing agreement between the Ancap and the private petroleum
                            companies operating in Uruguay, and requesting me to lend my informal
                            support with a view to an agreement consistent with the best interests
                            of the war effort. Reference is made also to the Embassy’s despatch no.
                            3437 of October 29, 1943, and to my telegram no. 998 of November
                                23.<note n="18" xml:id="d641fn18">Neither printed.</note></p>
                        <p>In its despatch no. 3437 of October 29, the Embassy reported that the
                            President of the Board of Directors of the Ancap had inquired of the
                            petroleum companies regarding the conditions under which they would be
                            willing to withdraw from the Uruguayan market. The matter was referred
                            by the the several local representatives to their head offices and,
                            having received instructions, they informed the Ancap on November 15
                            that the companies did not wish to withdraw and desired on the contrary
                            to commence negotiations looking to the renewal of the marketing
                            agreement. There is enclosed a copy of <pb n="772" xml:id="pg_772"
                                facs="0786"/>the memorandum<note n="19" xml:id="d641fn19">Not
                                printed.</note> handed the Ancap by the local representative of the
                            West India Oil Company. It is understood that identical or similar
                            replies were made by the other companies concerned.</p>
                        <p>The companies have been in frequent touch with the Embassy and have kept
                            it informed as to developments. After transmitting their reply to the
                            Ancap, the local representatives called at the Embassy for a discussion
                            of the situation with the Counselor of the Embassy and myself. I
                            informed them in a general way as to my instructions and expressed my
                            willingness to make available my informal good offices in the manner
                            authorized by the Department. I said that I wanted to help and not to
                            hinder and that before taking any action I should be glad to have the
                            benefit of their views as to the appropriate time for any discussion
                            which I might have with the Uruguayan authorities.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the companies were unanimous in suggesting that my
                            informal representations be made at any early date before the
                            negotiations with the Ancap got under way. They felt—and Mr. Dwyre and I
                            agreed—that the Department’s interest in an agreement consistent with
                            the war effort should be made known to the Uruguayan authorities
                            promptly rather than later when the Ancap might have taken a position
                            from which it would find it hard to recede.</p>
                        <p>My conversation with the representatives of the companies took place on
                            November 17 and in agreement with them I had expected to see the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs the following day. However, in the meantime
                            my British colleague informed me that, in view of the British interest
                            involved (Shell-Mex Uruguay Ltd.), he had cabled London for instructions
                            and sent a copy of his message to the British Embassy in Washington. He
                            inquired if I would be willing to wait a day or so in order that <hi
                                rend="italic">le cas échéant</hi> our representations might be made
                            more or less at the same time. Having assured myself that this was
                            agreeable to the representatives of the American companies, I informed
                            the British Minister that I would defer my interview with the Foreign
                            Minister. (At the same time I told him that, whatever might be the tenor
                            of his representations, I would not be in a position to take joint
                            action with him and that our interviews with Sr. Serrato<note n="20"
                                xml:id="d641fn20">Uruguayan Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note>
                            would have to be separate.)</p>
                        <p>The British Minister received his instructions over the week-end and on
                            Monday morning (November 22) it was agreed that I would seek an
                            interview with Sr. Serrato that afternoon and that Mr. Vereker would
                            endeavor to see him as soon thereafter as possible. As a matter of fact,
                            Sr. Serrato received me shortly after four and received the British
                            Minister about an hour later. I enclose English and Spanish texts of the
                                statement<note n="19" xml:id="d641fn21">Not printed.</note> which I
                            read in Spanish to Sr. Serrato and <pb n="773" xml:id="pg_773"
                                facs="0787"/>which is based on the Department’s instructions as set
                            forth in its telegram no. 341, June 23, 1943 and its instructions nos.
                            1650 and 1706 of September 29 and October 23. It will be observed that I
                            refrained from mentioning specifically a three-year renewal period. This
                            seemed distinctly advisable since it is the intention of the companies
                            to make an initial request for five years. Naturally my statement was so
                            worded as not to preclude my supporting a three-year renewal at a later
                            stage if occasion arises.</p>
                        <p>In spite of the purely informal character of my action, I considered it
                            essential that Sr. Serrato be furnished a written statement in order
                            that the Uruguayan authorities and others concerned might be under no
                            misapprehension as to the scope and nature of the support being given
                            the companies. I wanted the record to be perfectly clear as respects not
                            only what I was saying but also what I was not saying.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the action taken by the British Minister, I enclose a copy
                            which he has kindly furnished me of his statement to Sr. Serrato.<note
                                n="21" xml:id="d641fn22">Not printed.</note> As noted in my telegram
                            no. 998,<note n="21" xml:id="d641fn23">Not printed.</note> under his
                            instructions he is supporting a request for a renewal of the agreement
                            for a fiveyear period. In so doing he refers to paragraph 2 of the
                            protocol of the Anglo-Uruguayan trade agreement of 1935, the text of
                            which I also enclose.<note n="22" xml:id="d641fn24">For text of the

                        <p>In conclusion, I may add that in my interview with him Sr. Serrato said
                            nothing of any significance regarding the matter in hand, although he
                            did remark that he was not in favor of disturbing the present situation.
                            My British colleague informs me that his communication likewise elicited
                            from the Minister no comment of interest.</p>

                            the Board has decided to study the project of a new agreement with the
                            companies referred to which will be initiated with the companies within

                        <p>A report is being prepared on the operation of the Proclaimed List in
                            Uruguay which will include comments on the extent to which <pb n="775"
                                xml:id="pg_775" facs="0789"/>particular persons and firms are being
                            eliminated from the economic life of Uruguay as a result of their
                            inclusion in the Proclaimed List. This question and other related
                            Proclaimed List matters are, therefore, not discussed in the enclosed
                            report. It may be stated generally, however, that the Proclaimed List
                            has been very effective in Uruguay; that it enjoys the confidence and
                            support of the Uruguayan people; and that signs of financial stress on
                            those firms which are better able, from a financial standpoint, to ride
                            out the storm are becoming more pronounced. Questions relating to the
                            insurance field will likewise be discussed in a separate despatch. In
                            the interest of brevity the Uruguayan laws relating to dollar currency
                            control are omitted from the report because of the satisfactory nature
                            of those controls, the only problem here being the existence of a black
                            market of an unknown size.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that the Committee for Political Defense of the
                            Hemisphere has made a thorough study of the measures which have been
                            taken by Uruguay (and certain other American Republics) to implement the
                            resolutions passed by that Committee.<note n="28" xml:id="d643fn28">See

                            purposes, already emphasized to the Uruguayans certain inadequacies in
                            their controls. (The text of the Uruguayan Constitution and of various
                            Uruguayan laws appear in the Committee’s report of March 1943, entitled
                            “Leyes y Reglamentos Relacionados con la Defensa Nacional Contra
                            Actividades Subversivas”. An analysis of various Uruguayan laws in the
                            light of certain resolutions of the Committee appears in Annex E of 1943
                            entitled “Memorandum sobre legislación y prácticas administrativas de
                            acuerdo a los informes recogidos en la visita de consulta”. Both of
                            these reports have been forwarded to the Department.)</p>
                        <p>With a few minor exceptions, the Uruguayan financial and economic
                            controls (the May, 1940 freezing decree excepted) were put into effect
                            after the Rio de Janeiro Conference<note n="30" xml:id="d643fn30">Third

                            is significant in that it indicates that the Washington Conference has
                            had no appreciable effect on the Uruguayan controls.</p>
                        <pb n="776" xml:id="pg_776" facs="0790"/>
                        <p>The failure on Uruguay’s part to better implement the resolutions of the
                            Washington Conference is due to a number of causes. One of the most
                            important has been a reluctance to apply effective controls to Uruguayan
                            nationals. Another is an apparent reluctance to apply controls which
                            will seriously interfere with the operations within Uruguay of any
                            person or firm (regardless of nationality and apart firm any
                            consideration of importance of Uruguay’s economic life) because of the
                            effect which such action might have on business generally and the
                            consequent unemployment of Uruguayans through reduction of personnel,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>Another important cause has been the recent change of administration. As
                            is pointed out in the Embassy’s despatch No. 1858 of November 24, 1942,
                            there was a reluctance for political reasons to take any affirmative
                            action in the preelection period up to November 29, 1942. Subsequent to
                            the elections further delays have arisen from the fact that the
                            Presidential appointments to key offices were only recently approved by
                            the Congress.</p>
                        <p>Aside from the causes above mentioned, which are basically political in
                            nature, it is believed that there is a general failure on the part of
                            the Uruguayan public and on the part of many Government officials to
                            appreciate the extent of Uruguay’s failure to implement the Washington
                            Resolutions. This is probably due, in part at least, to the fact that
                            the same importance is not accorded the Washington Resolutions as, for
                            example, is accorded the Rio Resolutions. In particular fields, such as
                            censorship, certain constitutional questions also exist.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has consistently urged upon the appropriate Government
                            officials the importance of adopting additional controls. (See the
                            Embassy’s despatches No. 1550 of September 11, 1942, No. 1604 of
                            September 19, 1942 and No. 2033 of January 12, 1943.)<note n="31"
                                xml:id="d643fn31">None printed.</note> These efforts will, of
                            course, be continued. Various officers of the Embassy have also from
                            time to time discussed the matter on an informal basis with officials of
                            the Bank of the Republic, In these discussions the Embassy’s cooperation
                            has been offered particularly as regards explanations of the structure
                            of the United States controls and their administration.</p>
                        <p>In an effort to further emphasize the inadequacies of the present laws,
                            the Embassy, early in March of this year, prepared an analysis in
                            Spanish of the present Uruguayan controls in the light of the Washington
                            Resolutions and handed copies of this report to appropriate officials of
                            the Bank of the Republic. The Bank later stated that it had no
                            suggestions to offer. The report which was handed to the Bank is similar
                            included, <pb n="777" xml:id="pg_777" facs="0791"/>together with a brief
                            statement of how the United States had implemented each resolution.
                            Certain comments which appear in the enclosed English version on the
                            administration of the controls and certain statistical matter were
                            omitted in the Spanish copy.</p>
                        <p>As a further means of arousing interest in the controls, the Embassy
                            proposes to distribute Spanish copies of the Washington Resolutions to
                            various newspaper editors and other influential persons and to this end
                            requests that about forty Spanish copies and ten English copies of the
                            Resolutions be forwarded as soon as possible. It is suggested that about
                            five of the Spanish copies be sent airmail and that the balance be sent
                            by sea pouch. A mere reading of these resolutions will, it is believed,
                            serve to indicate to the Uruguayans the extent of their failure up to
                            this time to install adequate controls.</p>
                        <p>While the Embassy’s efforts have thus far not been followed by definite
                            action on the part of the Government, they have achieved the purpose of
                            keeping the matter continually before the appropriate officials and
                            particularly before the officials of the Bank of the Republic. The
                            following concrete results have been obtained:</p>
                        <p>In the latter part of 1942, the Embassy was advised that a tentative law
                            had been drafted by the Bank of the Republic which allegedly complied
                            with all of the Washington Resolutions, and that this draft had been
                            passed to the Foreign Office for approval. Mr. Silveira Zorzi of the
                            Bank, and probable author of the draft, stated last week that no action
                            had as yet been taken regarding the proposed law but that he remained
                            hopeful.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has not had access to a copy of this draft and it is entirely
                            possible that the Uruguayans will prefer to adopt additional controls
                            without previous consultation with the Embassy. In this connection, it
                            may be said that several months ago the Ambassador proposed that a
                            committee be formed to study the matter of controls, and, at the same
                            time, offered the Embassy’s cooperation in any way that might be
                            helpful. (See the Embassy’s despatch No. 1604 of September 19, 1942).
                            The suggestion as regards the formation of a committee was not favorably
                            received by Dr. Guani.<note n="32" xml:id="d643fn32">Alberto Guani, Vice
                                President of Uruguay.</note></p>
                        <p>In the latter part of June, 1943 Dr. Alberto Dominguez Campora, recently
                            appointed a director of the Bank of the Republic, stated that he had
                            conferred with the Minister of the Interior<note n="33"
                                xml:id="d643fn33">Carbajal Victorica.</note> and the President<note
                                n="34" xml:id="d643fn34">Juan José Amezaga</note> regarding the
                            above mentioned draft; that both were of the opinion that the Washington
                            Resolutions should be further implemented; that he had commenced work on
                            the draft; and that he would soon be in a position to discuss the matter
                            with the Embassy. Other officers of the bank have indicated that
                            additional measures will <pb n="778" xml:id="pg_778" facs="0792"
                            />probably be taken in the near future. While it is not possible to
                            predict the fate of this new endeavor with any degree of certainty, the
                            Department will be kept informed.</p>
                        <p>As the enclosed report will show, much remains to be done by Uruguay in
                            the field of economic and financial controls. On the other hand some
                            very important controls are already in effect, particularly as regards
                            the vital matter of trade with, and the remission of funds to, enemy
                            territory. Generally speaking, the most serious defect in the present
                            laws is the lack of an effective control over internal transactions and
                            property in Uruguay. While the need of additional controls to fill this
                            gap is fully appreciated, as a practical matter this need is partially
                            filled by the very satisfactory manner in which the Proclaimed List is
                            operating in Uruguay. It should be pointed out, furthermore, that the
                            administration of the present controls by the Bank of the Republic has
                            been surprisingly good. And, needless to say, the bank’s cooperation in
                            this and in other fields has been of great assistance to the Embassy in
                            economic warfare matters.</p>
                        <p>One matter which has been of constant concern to the Embassy regarding
                            control measures is the probability, if not the certainty, that
                            regardless of the additional laws that may be passed by the Uruguayan
                            Government, the same administrative efficiency to which we are
                            accustomed in the United States may not be expected. While, as above
                            pointed out, the bank of the Republic is efficiently administrated, the
                            same technical skill and knowledge do not exist in other agencies, such
                            as customs, which necessarily must be relied upon to make the controls
                            effective.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the nature of the enclosed report it may be said, in
                            conclusion, that the purpose was to present the controls as they are
                            actually construed and administered by the Bank, as distinguished from
                            how they should be construed, improved and administered. It is thought
                            that the matters last mentioned are adequately covered in the
                            Department’s above mentioned instruction No. 976 and the circular
                            instruction of August 4, 1942 entitled “Measures Adopted by the
                            Inter-American Conference on Systems of Economic and Financial Control”
                            and the November 13, 1942 supplement thereto.<note n="35"
                                xml:id="d643fn35">None printed.</note> It will also be noted that
                            the texts of the controls are freely translated in the footnotes in an
                            effort to achieve greater clarity and these translations differ somewhat
                            from the more literal and technically precise translations forwarded in
                            previous despatches. Since in some instances the translations are so
                            free as to amount almost to a construction of the text, the translations
                            are not enclosed in quotations.</p>

                                xml:id="d644fn36">Not printed.</note> entitled “Uruguayan Banks and
                            Proclaimed List Nationals” wherein the Department was informed of the
                            program which the Embassy had initiated with regard to the curtailment
                            of banking facilities to Proclaimed List nationals in Uruguay, and to
                            the Department’s instruction no. 1266 of April 12, 1943<note n="36"
                                xml:id="d644fn37">Not printed.</note> in answer thereto.</p>
                        <p>The following results have been obtained through this program during the
                            past six months: (1) Proclaimed List nationals have been compelled to
                            liquidate outstanding loans amounting to $U 1,297,857.54; (2) credits
                            requested by said nationals amounting to approximately $U 2,500,000 have
                            been rejected by the banks; (3) approximately seventy real estate
                            properties owned by said nationals, which had been under administration
                            by the banks, have been turned back to their owners; (4) approximately
                            twenty business firms whose names appear on the Proclaimed List have
                            been compelled to vacate business premises owned or administered by said
                            banks; and (5) two important enemy firms have undergone the
                            prestige-lowering embarrassment of being sued in court for non-payment
                            of matured debts.</p>
                        <p>No legal economic controls have been adopted in Uruguay through which the
                            Embassy could insist upon proceedings of the above type against
                            Proclaimed List nationals. (See memorandum enclosure in despatch no.
                            1858 of November 24, 1942.)<note n="37" xml:id="d644fn38">Neither
                                printed.</note> While the economic weapon of the Proclaimed List
                            could have been brought to bear on the ground that granting banking
                            facilities to enemy nationals violated the Proclaimed List policy of “no
                            dealing with enemy nationals”, the Embassy felt that an insinuation as
                            to the possibility of their inclusion made to the local banks who were
                            dealing with such nationals would produce (in this instance) an effect
                            contrary to that desired. The success of the program depended upon its
                            adoption by all of the banks which engaged in the business of lending
                            money; the banks would have hesitated to alienate good clients (by
                            requiring a closing of accounts) while another bank was welcoming such
                            customers and refinancing their canceled loans. Furthermore, the Banco
                            Hipotecario, which is a State institution, engages in the business of
                            lending money upon mortgage security, and under the strict letter of the
                            law it cannot discriminate <pb n="780" xml:id="pg_780" facs="0794"
                            />against a person who offers good and sufficient security; it cannot,
                            under present law, discriminate against a business enterprise because it
                            is on the Proclaimed List.</p>

                            Credits/11301) in reply to the Embassy’s despatch no. 3019 of August 2,
                            1943, transmitting a report on the Uruguayan financial and economic
                            controls.</p>
                        <p>As the Department is aware, questions pertaining to controls have had the
                            special attention of Mr. Thomas C. Mann, an Auxiliary Officer, who is
                            about to leave Montevideo to take up his new duties in Washington.
                            Before departing, Mr. Mann has prepared a memorandum in which he reviews
                            the existing situation and indicates in the light of his experience the
                            minimum control measures which we should like to see Uruguay adopt. A
                            copy of this memorandum is enclosed.<note n="40" xml:id="d645fn41">Not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>It will be observed that Mr. Mann concludes that the minimum measures
                            desired would require legislative action in the form of an adequate
                            freezing law. As the Department knows, in spite of the consistent
                            efforts of the Embassy over a long period, it has proved extremely
                            difficult to interest the Uruguayan authorities in more effective
                            implementation of the Washington Resolutions. There is no present
                            likelihood that the Government will on its own initiative propose
                            legislation to Congress. It might perhaps do so under pressure from the
                            Embassy but I am convinced that to induce the Government even to draft a
                            bill would prove a long and tedious process. The present legislative
                            session will end on December 15. As the Embassy has reported, Congress
                            is functioning in a very unsatisfactory manner and the Government is
                            experiencing difficulty in obtaining the enactment even of urgent
                            measures in which it is interested. The situation has been fully set
                            forth in the Embassy’s despatch no. 3338 of October 9, 1943, enclosing a
                            detailed study<note n="41" xml:id="d645fn42">Neither printed.</note>
                            prepared by Dr. Eugene A. Gilmore.<note n="42" xml:id="d645fn43">Senior
                                Economic Analyst of the Embassy.</note> As pointed out therein, it
                            is unlikely that <pb n="781" xml:id="pg_781" facs="0795"/>Congress will
                            find time to consider any new legislation during the present
                            session.</p>
                        <p>For the reasons indicated, I consider that there is no possibility of the
                            enactment during the present session of a freezing law such as would be
                            required to make Uruguayan controls more effective. I believe that the
                            earliest date at which such legislation could be obtained, if at all,
                            would be May of next year. In the circumstances, the Embassy questions
                            the advisability of pressing the matter with the Uruguayan Government
                            for the present. Since there is no hope of obtaining action before the
                            next session, I should be disposed to defer any further representations
                            until January. If it then appears desirable, appropriate efforts could
                            be made to induce the Government to draft a suitable bill for
                            presentation to Congress when it reconvenes in March.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, I should be glad to have the benefit of an expression of
                            the Department’s views and wishes with respect to just how far the
                            Embassy should go in urging the Government to take the action desired.
                            It is believed that, in considering the matter, the officers of the
                            Department will wish to take advantage of the approaching opportunity to
                            discuss the whole situation with Mr. Mann who is thoroughly familiar
                            with all aspects of the question.</p>
                        <p>As I have repeatedly pointed out, while the Uruguayan Government has from
                            the outset given courageous and effective support to our policies and
                            has cooperated magnificently in what may be broadly termed the political
                            field, its cooperation has been considerably less enthusiastic and less
                            effective in what may be termed the economic field. In fact, in the
                            light of our experience thus far, I am inclined to doubt whether,
                            whatever representations the Embassy may make and however persistently
                            it may pursue the matter, Uruguay can ever be induced to adopt the
                            measures called for by the Washington Resolutions or to carry them out
                            efficiently if they were to be adopted. Recent Allied victories make the
                            attainment of this goal even more difficult than formerly because of the
                            over-optimism which they have engendered and the widespread tendency to
                            believe that the war in Europe is practically won and may end almost any
                            day.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately, certain favorable factors make the absence of more effective
                            controls of less practical importance than may be the case in some other
                            countries. In the first place, Uruguay is a small country and German
                            interests are not extensive. More important, the Proclaimed List has
                            functioned and continues to function in a very satisfactory manner and
                            its effectiveness and the effectiveness also of such controls as exist
                            have been materially enhanced by the excellent cooperation of the Bank
                            of the Republic and other institutions. From a practical standpoint, I
                            doubt if Uruguay’s failure to implement more adequately the Washington
                            Resolutions has prejudiced our war effort <pb n="782" xml:id="pg_782"
                                facs="0796"/>to any appreciable degree; and, since the attainment of
                            more effective implementation is to say the least problematical, the
                            question may well be raised as to whether we should press for additional

                        <p>A–589. Reference Embassy’s despatch 3211 of September 13.<note n="43"

                            Interdepartmental Committee concerning the question raised in the last
                            section of the Embassy’s despatch relating to the inclusion of firms in
                            the Proclaimed List for a specified period of time as a penalty for
                            dealings with Proclaimed List nationals. The Committee’s views were as
                            follows: <list>

                                        <item>where the transaction is of particular assistance to
                                            the Proclaimed List firm in its undesirable
                                            activities.</item>

                                <item>The Committee believes that the Proclaimed List should not be
                                    regarded or utilized as a means of meting out punishment for
                                    inimical acts but as a practical weapon for waging economic
                                    warfare, and that additions to the Proclaimed List should be
                                    made primarily for the purpose of invoking control measures by
                                    this government.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The Committee believes that, except in the instances referred
                                    to in paragraph 1, the Embassy should accept an undertaking
                                    whenever it has reason to believe that it would be adhered
                                    to.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Committee recognizes that there are a certain number of cases which
                            would not be included in the Proclaimed List and in which an undertaking
                            would not be deemed feasible, but it is felt that the alternative of
                            using the Proclaimed List as a means of graduated punishment to prevent
                            all dealings with Proclaimed List nationals would be an obvious
                            interference in the affairs of the other American republics that would
                            react against this government and, on balance, against the effectiveness
                            of the Proclaimed List generally.</p>

                            that from his talks in Washington there will probably result a 100
                            million peso loan for Public Works. In a press interview given in
                            Montevideo the previous day he talked of a 5-year Public Works plan and
                            a large loan without mentioning any specific amount.</p>
                        <p>I have, of course, given Guani no encouragement to expect a large loan.
                            Furthermore, in our various conversations I had pointed out consistently
                            that it would be unfortunate if people here were allowed to expect too
                            much from his visit and in particular if they gained the advance
                            impression that a sizeable loan would be sought or abounding.</p>

                            have avoided the necessity of an external loan. In this connection it
                            should be noted that the President-elect, Dr. Amezaga, is Vice-President

                            the Administration and the members of the Council were presumably
                            motivated by a desire to avoid the inevitable delays incident to
                            organizing the new session rather than by a fear that the project would

                                February 4, 1943. It provided that the Export-Import Bank extend a
                                credit of $20,000,000 for the purchase of supplies, equipment, and
                                services. This was for roads, bridges, sanitation and sewerage
                                facilities, reservoirs, agriculture and irrigation projects, certain
                                specified airports, and hydroelectric and railroad construction
                                insofar as these did not require war-needed materials from the
                                United States. Uruguay was to present to the Bank statements of
                                withdrawal of funds accompanied by promissory notes. The loan was to
                                be paid in twenty-five semi-annual installments with interest at
                                four percent. The supplies and equipment were to be purchased from
                                the United States. The Bank was to have the right to inspect public
                                works projects and verify records and accounts. Uruguay was to
                                furnish quarterly and other reports, to levy no taxes on the
                                promissory notes, and to make no payment from the loan to firms or
                                persons on the Proclaimed List.]</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">El Debate</hi> was not only bitterly hostile to
                            President Baldomir but attacked him and his Administration in the most
                            scurrilous manner. Shortly after the conclusion of the loan agreement
                            had been announced, it began inquiring in its columns and has continued
                            to inquire whether a “commission” had been paid in connection with the
                            loan—its inquiry being tantamount to accusing Dr. Guani or some other
                            official of the Baldomir Administration of profiting personally by the
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>On March 13 and in its two succeeding issues <hi rend="italic">El

                            ground that the Export-Import Bank is to exercise a certain control over
                            the expenditure of the funds and to designate a “fiscal” (representative
                            with supervisory functions) for the purpose. <hi rend="italic">El

                            that the Department may appreciate on what a low and scurrilous plane
                            the campaign is being conducted, I enclose copies of the three articles
                            referred to.<note n="48" xml:id="d649fn48">None reprinted.</note>
                            Similar items will no doubt continue to appear.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has seen no other recent comment regarding the loan agreement
                            in the Montevideo press. Incidentally neither the text nor the details
                            of the agreement have been made public.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">El Debate’s</hi> articles are on a par with other
                            blasts directed against the Baldomir Administration and in view of its
                            general attitude what it says need not be taken too seriously.</p>
                        <p>However, a few days ago Dr. Javier Mendívil, who was Minister of Finance
                            in the Baldomir Cabinet and now holds the position of Minister of
                            Industries and Labor, told me that he was very disappointed in the terms
                            of the agreement signed by Dr. Guani with the Export-Import Bank. He
                            referred in particular to the clauses requiring the Government to
                            justify and to report upon the expenditure of funds and stated that the
                            contract contained provisions which were “humiliating” and should not be
                            necessary in the case of a country like Uruguay. He said that Uruguay
                            had an excellent financial record and that it could not for a moment be
                            supposed that the loan would be used otherwise than for the purpose
                            granted. Dr. Mendivíl expressed <pb n="786" xml:id="pg_786" facs="0800"
                            />the opinion that no Congress would have approved such an
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>I told Dr. Mendívil that according to my understanding the Export-Import
                            Bank operates subject to regulations and laws restricting the purposes
                            for which and the conditions under which loans may be granted. I said
                            also that similar agreements with the Bank had been entered into by
                            other governments and that in fact it was my understanding that Uruguay
                            had received rather more liberal treatment than certain other
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Thus far Dr. Mendívil is the only Uruguayan official who has mentioned
                            the matter to me.</p>
                        <p>I am under the impression that Uruguay was given very liberal treatment
                            as respects not only the financial terms of the loan but also the degree
                            of control to be exercised by the Export-Import Bank over
                            expenditures.</p>
                        <p>It might be helpful if the Department could send me a brief statement
                            regarding the matter which I could communicate either officially or
                            informally to the Foreign Office or to President Amezaga himself. I have
                            in mind a statement covering very briefly the conditions under which the
                            Bank usually makes such agreements and confirming my impression that
                            Uruguay did receive particularly favorable treatment (assuming of course
                            that this impression is correct). Such a statement would be useful in
                            case the President and other officials should have the idea that the
                            agreement contains provisions which are “humiliating” for Uruguay.</p>

                            no. 2306 of March 15, 1943, concerning the recent agreement under which
                            the Export-Import Bank opened a credit of $20,000,000 in favor of the
                            Government of Uruguay, and reporting with regard to criticism of the
                            agreement primarily because of the control to be exercised by the Bank.

                        <p>The Embassy received this morning from the Foreign Office a note stating
                            that the Government finds Clauses 5, 8 and 9 of the agreement<note
                                n="50" xml:id="d650fn50">Clause 5 provided that Uruguay present to

                                promissory notes of the Republic; clause 8 required that equipment

                            addressed to the Uruguayan Embassy in Washington, The Foreign Office
                            requests my assistance in the matter. The text of the note and an

                        <p>I already had an appointment later in the morning with the Foreign
                                Minister<note n="52" xml:id="d650fn52">José Serrato.</note> and in
                            the course of our conversation he mentioned the loan matter and his
                            note. He told me that the instructions to the Uruguayan Ambassador in
                                Washington<note n="53" xml:id="d650fn53">Juan Carlos Blanco.</note>
                            referred to in the note had been forwarded yesterday by airmail and not
                            by telegraph. He gave me for my information a copy of a memorandum which
                            had also been sent to the Ambassador. I enclose copies of this
                                memorandum<note n="54" xml:id="d650fn54">Not printed.</note> which
                            lack of time has made it impracticable to translate.</p>
                        <p>Minister Serrato said that he hoped and believed that the changes desired
                            by the Uruguayan Government could be made in the agreement. He expressed
                            the opinion that matters could be taken care of by changes in wording
                            which would satisfy Uruguayan sentiment and at the same time give the
                            Export-Import Bank the assurances which it requires.</p>
                        <p>As I had previously told Dr. Mendívil (my despatch no. 2306), I explained
                            to Sr. Serrato that, according to my understanding, the Export-Import
                            Bank operates subject to laws and regulations restricting the purposes
                            for which and the conditions under which loans may be granted. I said
                            also that similar agreements with the Bank had been entered into by
                            other governments and that in fact it was my understanding that Uruguay
                            had received rather more liberal treatment than certain other countries.
                            I assured him that there had been no intention whatever to cast any
                            reflection on the credit of the Uruguayan Government or on the conduct
                            of its finances and of course no intention to impose conditions which
                            could in any way be considered as “humiliating”.</p>
                        <p>Sr. Serrato said that he realized all this but that it must be remembered
                            that Uruguayan opinion is very sensitive (<hi rend="italic"
                                >quisquilloso</hi>). He remarked that the loan contract in its
                            present form would prove highly embarrassing politically, that it would
                            be made a political football by the Herreristas, and that in fact an
                            Herrerista Senator had already <pb n="788" xml:id="pg_788" facs="0802"
                            />requested information concerning Dr. Guani’s negotiations with the
                            Export-Import Bank.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Sr. Serrato said that, speaking quite frankly, it was his
                            opinion that, unless the clauses in question were amended to meet the
                            local situation, the Government would not make use of the loan.</p>
                        <p>I may add that today’s <hi rend="italic">Mañana</hi> contains an article
                            stating that the Government has suggested certain changes in the loan
                            agreement, that the changes pertain to control clauses which are hardly
                            in accord with the “principles of inter-American cooperation”, and that
                            this shows that <hi rend="italic">La Mariana</hi> was right in
                            criticizing at the time the haste with which the agreement was
                            considered by the Council of State. <hi rend="italic">Critica</hi> of
                            Buenos Aires also dealt with the matter yesterday in an article in which
                            its Montevideo correspondent reports that the former Council of State
                            authorized within 24 hours (as was the case) the signing of an <hi
                                rend="italic">ad referendum</hi> agreement; that this was done on
                            the basis of a telegram from Dr. Guani containing the financial
                            conditions of the operation; that the urgency was due to Dr. Guani’s
                            desire to sign the agreement himself; and that “subsequently and in an
                            additional document” other clauses were stipulated which the present
                            Government considers; objectionable (<hi rend="italic"
                                >inconvenientes</hi>).</p>
                        <p>It is to be hoped that some means can be found by the Department and the
                            Export-Import Bank of adjusting the difficulties which have arisen. In
                            view of the more recent developments and of my conversation with
                            Minister Serrato, it is doubted if the statement suggested in the
                            closing paragraph of my despatch no. 2306 would suffice to overcome the
                            objections of the Uruguayan Government.</p>

                            Serrato transmits a sheet (copy also enclosed)<note n="55"

                            which the Uruguayan Government proposes as respects clauses 5, 8 and 9.
                            In his note he states (as is likewise indicated on the sheet setting
                            forth the proposed changes) that it is desired also that the third
                            paragraph of clause 5 and all of clause 10 be eliminated.</p>

                        <p>There appeared last evening in the Montevideo newspaper <hi rend="italic"
                                >El Plata</hi> (Blanco Independiente) a good statement (text
                                enclosed<note n="56" xml:id="d651fn56">Not printed.</note>) in which
                            Dr. Guani discusses the conditions under which the Export-Import Bank
                            opens credits and states that the control provisions in the recent
                            agreement are those included in “all other loans granted by the said
                            bank to other nations and are also the same as those stipulated and
                            already accepted by the Uruguayan Government in the contract negotiated
                            a few months ago with the same bank for financing the Rio Negro work.”
                            Dr. Guani adds that the financial terms are the best that could have
                            been obtained anywhere in the world at the present time and are also
                            more favorable than those of any other loan agreement signed by Uruguay
                            prior to 1942.</p>

                            explainable in the special case of the Rione, are “embarrassing” (<hi

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my telegram
                            no. 337 of March 24, 3 p.m., and to previous correspondence concerning
                            changes desired by the Uruguayan Government in the loan agreement
                            recently signed by Dr. Guani with the Export-Import Bank.</p>
                        <p>I met President Amezaga yesterday evening at a social gathering and had
                            with him an informal conversation in the course of which he referred to
                            the loan. He said that while he fully appreciated that the agreement
                            followed the lines of similar contracts negotiated by the Export-Import
                            Bank, including that with the Rione, nevertheless in the case of an
                            agreement entered into by the Uruguayan Government itself it would be
                            extremely difficult for political reasons to accept its provisions
                            without amendment.</p>
                        <p>He stressed in particular the provision in clause 9 giving the
                            Export-Import Bank the right “through its designated representative or
                            representatives to inspect any approved project or projects and to
                            receive and verify all the necessary information regarding all records
                            and accounts relative thereto”. It may be recalled that as reported in
                            my despatch no. 2306 of March 15, 1943, the Herrerista <hi rend="italic"
                                >Debate</hi>, in violent articles condemning the loan agreement,
                            referred specifically to the designation by the Bank of a “fiscal”
                            (representative with supervisory functions) for the purpose of
                            controlling expenditures under the loan.</p>
                        <p>In our conversation of last evening President Amezaga said that he hoped
                            very much that matters could be adjusted satisfactorily <pb n="791"
                                xml:id="pg_791" facs="0805"/>and that he believed that this could be
                            accomplished if the Export-Import Bank would designate the Bank of the
                            Republic as its representative for the purposes envisaged in clause 9.
                            It may be noted that in the changes proposed by the Foreign Office in
                            its note of March 19 (enclosures nos. 1 and 2 to my despatch no. 2340),
                            it was suggested that clause 9 be amended to read as follows: <quote

                            Dr. Guani had failed to inform the Government fully and had acted
                            independently because of his desire to handle the whole matter

                        <p>200. Your 341, March 25, 4 p.m. The Department has examined Articles 5, 8
                            and 9 of the Agreement with officers of the Bank who inform the
                            Department as follows: Article 5 establishes mechanism for making
                            advances and is procedure heretofore adopted by Bank for public works
                            contracts. Article 8 is required by United States legislation. Article 9
                            is likewise a standard clause which appears in all contracts due to the
                            necessity Bank has of being able to report on manner in which public
                            funds which it has advanced under loan agreements have been used. These
                            provisions appear in all contracts of similar nature signed by Bank with
                            other countries.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy’s attention is called especially to the following two points:
                            (1) The Agreement of February 4 signed with Dr. Guani was first taken up

                            The Bank is an official institution of this Government handling public
                            funds and it must at all times be in a position to render full
                            accounting of funds advanced by it. Furthermore it should be pointed out
                            that the terms of no other loan agreement of like character signed by
                            the Bank with any other country are more liberal or favorable to that
                            country than those contained in the Agreement with Uruguay.</p>

                            Government the Department believes that it will be more satisfactory for
                            all concerned to have matter resolved through him with the Bank and the

                        <p>412. Department’s telegram 296, May 1, 7 p.m. While adverse report of
                            Naval Attaché appears justified in opinion of our experts here, I
                            consider that constructive use should be made of technical study
                            suggested on page 13 thereof. This procedure would give Venezuela an
                            opportunity to establish a set-up to correct existing lack of
                            facilities.</p>

                            suggested technical study, approval of smaller number might be employed
                            as justification for contemplated study, pending any further
                            approvals.</p>

                            Although the second paragraph of Article X of the agreement<note n="10"
                                xml:id="d662fn10">The Lend-Lease Agreement.</note> does not provide
                            for any further action after the act of ratification by the Public
                            Powers of Venezuela in order to bring the agreement into full force, and
                            does not provide for any further exchange of instruments of any kind,
                            the Department is willing to have an exchange of notes at Caracas if the
                            Venezuelan authorities are convinced that such action is essential in
                            conformity with Venezuelan constitutional procedures. So far as this
                            Government is concerned a simple notification that the agreement has
                            been ratified by the Public Powers of Venezuela would be regarded as
                            sufficient.</p>
                        <p>The Department will forward promptly certain changes which it considers
                            necessary in the wording of the note, which the Ministry of Foreign
                            Affairs has drafted for presentation by the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>With reference to numbered paragraphs 1 and 2 in note no. 494 of February
                            18 from Dr. Parra Pérez,<note n="11" xml:id="d662fn11">Not printed; it
                                was addressed to Ambassador Corrigan and cited the 77th article of
                                the Venezuelan Constitution requiring the sanction of the Chamber of
                                Deputies and the Senate to all treaties and agreements as the reason
                                for an exchange of notes (831.24/497). See Articles 77 and 100 of
                                the <hi rend="italic">Constitución de los Estados Unidos de

                                (Caracas, 1936).</note> it is the policy of this Government to
                            maintain the strictly confidential character of this type of agreement.
                            It was, accordingly, understood by the negotiators that this agreement
                            would be treated as strictly confidential. It appears that Article 77 of
                            the Constitution provides that the right to approve or disapprove
                            international agreements rests with the Venezuelan Legislature and that
                            such instruments shall not be published officially before having been
                            ratified and exchanged, but there does not appear to be any express
                            requirement that such instruments shall be published in all cases,
                            irrespective of the confidential character of the agreement. Inquiry may
                            be made whether the eighth paragraph of Article 100 of the Constitution
                            gives the President any discretion in regard to a question concerning
                            publication in such a case. The Department would appreciate being
                            informed as to the possibility of arriving at a satisfactory solution of
                            this matter.</p>

                            In note No. 2156 the Foreign Minister informed me that in view of the

                        <p>Colonel Johnston replied that this list is a huge affair comprising large
                            quantities of various types of munitions of war (for instance 16,000
                            rifles). Many of these articles are now extremely critical in view of
                            the anticipated military operations abroad and it is, therefore,
                            impossible to supply these to Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Johnston added that further consideration would be given to the

                        <p>In a recent conversation with a member of the Venezuelan Embassy staff, I
                            learned confidentially that one of the items which it is likely that
                            President Medina will discuss during his visit is the acquisition of
                            additional Lend-Lease material, particularly planes for the Army’s use.
                            You will recall that we received a note from the Venezuelan Embassy
                            requesting the Department’s assistance in obtaining certain Lend-Lease
                            equipment contained in a list presented to the War Department by the
                            Venezuelan Military Attaché, and that a necessarily evasive reply has
                            just been sent to the Venezuelan Embassy.<note n="25" xml:id="d669fn25"

                                xml:id="d672fn32">Not printed.</note> a memorandum dated January 30,
                            1943, copy of which is transmitted as Enclosure No. 1 to this
                                Despatch,<note n="32" xml:id="d672fn33">Enclosures to this despatch
                                not printed.</note> was submitted to the Minister of Fomento
                            outlining the principal points to be covered in the proposed diamond
                            purchase agreement from our point of view. On February 3, Mr. Groves,
                            Counselor of Embassy for Economic Affairs, submitted to me a memorandum
                            reporting his latest conversation with the Minister of Fomento on this
                            subject; a copy of this memorandum is transmitted as Enclosure No. 2 to
                            this Despatch.</p>
                        <p>The reply from the Minister of Fomento to the memorandum of January 30,
                            dated February 27, and received by the Embassy on March 6, is
                            transmitted herewith as Enclosure No. 3.</p>
                        <p>In substance, the Minister’s reply states that all appropriate measures
                            which the Government might take Under an eventual preclusive diamond
                            purchase agreement with the United States already are embodied in
                            Venezuelan law, and that the conclusion of a formal agreement,
                            therefore, seems unnecessary to accomplish the desired purpose. The
                            Minister suggests that “more rapid and efficacious results would be
                            attained if the Government of the United States of America, directly or
                            indirectly, by means of competent agents, would buy the diamonds at the
                            very site of production”, i.e., would buy them on a commercial basis
                            direct from the producers, before they have a chance to get into other
                            hands.</p>
                        <p>For this purpose no formalities between the two Governments would be
                            required; it is believed the only requisite would be that any buying <pb
                                n="803" xml:id="pg_803" facs="0817"/>agents who might be sent to
                            Venezuela, to actively conduct diamond purchasing, would have to comply
                            with the conditions of the mining law regarding registration, etc.;
                            pertinent excerpts (in Spanish) of the mining law of 1936 with the
                            amendment of February 12, 1938 to include diamonds, are forwarded as
                            Enclosure No. 4.</p>
                        <p>The Minister in his communication likewise confirms an assurance
                            previously given to the Embassy by the Minister of Hacienda<note n="33"
                                xml:id="d672fn34">Alfredo Machado Hernandez.</note> that the
                            granting of export permits required for shipment of all industrial
                            diamonds abroad has been, and will continue to be, confined to the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>As implied in his communication of February 27, and stated more
                            explicitly by the Minister in conversations with Mr. Groves, the
                            Venezuelan authorities feel that there is little more they can do to
                            make the control of the diamond trade more effective, beyond the
                            measures already in force (see Embassy’s Telegram No. 1252 of November
                            29, 1942, 10 P.M.,<note n="34" xml:id="d672fn35">Not printed.</note> and
                            excerpts of mining law attached), without modification of the existing
                            basic law, which provides that “the trade in gold (and diamonds by
                            amendment of February 12, 1938) is free”. But even with an appropriate
                            modification of the law, the Minister of Fomento doubts whether the
                            Government could establish efficacious controls over the diamond trade
                            without extension of police activities and other methods greatly out of
                            proportion to the significance of the trade.</p>
                        <p>In view of the peculiar characteristics of diamond production in
                            Venezuela, in a very isolated area where Government controls are
                            virtually non-existent, the Embassy shares the views of the Minister of
                            Fomento that the most practical way of controlling the local trade in
                            diamonds is simply to purchase the output at the source of production.
                            Experience in this country amply indicates that control is next to
                            impossible once the diamonds are sold by the hundreds of individual
                            miners and get into the hands of the trade.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested, therefore, that the American authorities consider the
                            advisability of sending to Venezuela competent diamond experts to carry
                            out a direct purchase program at the source of supplies. For this
                            purpose, it is probable that the assistance of qualified and reliable
                            persons already engaged in the local trade could be enlisted to
                            cooperate with any agents sent from the United States.</p>

                                Platinum/18a).</note> Since the only consequential Venezuelan
                            strategic product being diverted to Axis is diamonds, and the only
                            effective method of controlling movement of this product is to buy it
                            from producers before it reaches undesirable hands, I consider it unwise
                            to request Venezuelan authorities to institute additional control
                            measures on outgoing cargo and persons when expected results must be

                            the Embassy’s constantly repeated efforts in this matter.</p>
                        <p>This counter-draft, in conformity with the procedure followed in previous
                            agreements pertaining to Rubber Production, Food Production and Health
                            and Sanitation, respectively, is drawn up in the form of a <hi

                            the agreement. Thus in this proposed agreement which was projected for a
                            three year period, the culminating date would be 1946 if the agreement
                            is completed in 1943, subject to annual renewal. An agreement of this
                            type does not require Congressional consent, but the Chief Executive is
                            obliged to inform the Congress thereof at the next regular session of

                            Lieb of Standard told me he approved proposed draft of petroleum law in
                            present or substantially similar form. He expressed opinion that this
                            would benefit industry as a whole, due to more stable conditions
                            expected to ensue, and eliminate constant bickerings between companies
                            and Venezuelan Government.</p>
                        <p>Hamilton and Greer of Gulf are now in United States.</p>
                        <pb n="808" xml:id="pg_808" facs="0822"/>
                        <p>British Minister told me recently that Shell, while having minor
                            objections of its own on certain points, would under no circumstances
                            break off negotiations if these were not met, and he expects Shell will
                            consent to adoption of law along lines drafted, considering this will be
                            beneficial to the industry.</p>
                        <p>Sinclair of Consolidated orally expressed his satisfaction with
                            developments here before leaving prior to Christmas.</p>
                        <p>Case and Brown of Socony are expected here shortly, accompanying Sheldon
                            when he returns on January 8.</p>
                        <p>Boylan, local manager of Caracas Petroleum Company, expressed
                            gratification at evidence of inclusion in draft of certain points made
                            by Alfred Meyer, president of the company, in conversations with
                                Thornburg.<note n="50" xml:id="d680fn50">Max Thornburg, Petroleum
                                Adviser.</note> Boylan added that while proposed law was somewhat
                            onerous to his company, this did not apply to operations being carried
                            on for it by Texas Company, but to individual holdings now greatly
                            reduced and that if Texas, Socony, etc., could adopt new law, his
                            company would be able to carry on. He mentioned that in his opinion
                            certain rebates provided for pipe lines to seaports would tend to reduce
                            the increased royalty burden.</p>
                        <p>Lieb informed me when here that after adoption of new law the Venezuelan
                            Government plans to undertake the following: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>

                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Propaganda campaign with pictures showing benefits companies

                            </list></p>
                        <p>He said that ensuing simplification of procedure when these measures were
                            in force would enable considerable reduction in personnel payrolls in
                            future operations and would thus offset increased costs to operating
                            companies so that net increase would probably not exceed 1–2 cents per
                            barrel of crude. A further offset against increased costs would be
                            stabilized concessions and absence of law suits. He said that in any
                            case the increased costs would be much less than in the industry in the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Reliable confidential information reveals that discussions are now in
                            progress in high Venezuelan Government quarters which may lead to
                            adjustment in the conversion tax downward, thus aiding the smaller
                            companies including Pantepec. Also in case of Pantepec possible
                            contractual adjustments with Standard may help. There is no Pantepec
                            representative here at present. Buckley’s attitude has not gained any
                            added good will for Pantepec in Venezuelan Government quarters.</p>
                        <p>It is my judgment that the advantages which the adoption of the new law
                            will apparently provide for the petroleum industry in Venezuela as a
                            whole, will thus be beneficial to the smaller companies and <pb n="809"
                                xml:id="pg_809" facs="0823"/>to non-operating companies such as
                            Caracas and Pantepec which derive their income from properties operated
                            by others. On the basis of information at hand, although some minor
                            aspects of the draft are still being considered, it will provide clear
                            titles after adoption, eliminate points of disagreement about past
                            questionable concessions and thus create an atmosphere for healthy
                            development in which the long range interests of all groups will be

                        <p>Because of the complex and diverse aspects of the oil industry, it does
                            not appear possible to draft a law which would fit all interests
                            perfectly, but it seems axiomatic that if the industry as a whole
                            benefits, its components likewise benefit. In addition, special
                            consideration is being given to aiding the smaller companies if a
                            downward revision of the conversion tax can be accomplished.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since my return I have had a number of
                            informal conversations concerning the oil business with regard to the
                            development of the present negotiations. Among the people with whom I
                            have conversed are President Medina and Mr. Curtice, his technical
                            consultant, with regard to the Governmental point of view, Mr. Proudfit,
                            successor of Henry Linam as head of the Standard Oil Company of New
                            Jersey, and Waldo Emerson Sheldon, local head of the Socony Company. In
                            brief, the development seemed to be about as follows:</p>
                        <p>The basic proposal which was set forth in the letter that Mr. Thornburg
                            wrote to Gustavo Manrique<note n="54" xml:id="d681fn54">Not found in
                                Department files.</note> found general acceptance. These more or
                            less basic principles having been decided upon and the decks <pb n="810"
                                xml:id="pg_810" facs="0824"/>being thus cleared for action,
                            representatives of the Government and the oil industry sat down to write
                            a basic petroleum law. It appeared as though this law would be written
                            speedily and accepted without delay, but there came a certain public
                            clamor against railroading the law, along with some attacks on Gustavo
                            Manrique, citing his record as a former attorney for the oil companies
                            during the time of Gómez, which caused the President to adopt new
                            tactics. He announced his determination to allow all interests to have a
                            hearing and called in people representing all sectors of public opinion
                            including ministers of former administrations who might now be
                            considered of the opposition. He evidently wished to fortify his
                            position to be able to say that his policy of revision of relations
                            between the nation and the oil companies (now publicized as the <hi
                                rend="italic">política revisionista</hi>) had had a thorough hearing
                            and that all elements had been able to voice their opinion and give
                            their counsel. He finally named a council of about 18 lawyers and
                            experts headed by Minister of Fomento Eugenio Mendoza to examine the law
                            paragraph by paragraph. Mr. Curtice, the Venezuelan Government’s expert
                            informed me that the Commission had about reached Article 35, that there
                            are some eighty odd articles in the law and that some of the most
                            controversial ones have not yet been considered. This of course has
                            slowed things down and at the present rate of progress it seems that it
                            will be at least another month before the work of this Commission will
                            be completed and the law be ready for presentation to Congress.</p>
                        <p>The President told me that he had been sitting with this Commission as
                            much as two hours a day during the past week, and while it interfered
                            greatly with his many other duties he felt that it was of sufficient
                            importance to make it worth his while to devote to it his personal
                            attention. The exact make-up of the Commission that is now examining the
                            law has never been made public. Even Mr. Curtice, the
                            Government-retained expert, said that he did not know just who
                            constituted the membership. The President told me that there were at
                            least two former Ministers of Fomento, and it is more or less public
                            knowledge that Dr. Egaña, Minister of Fomento under López Contreras, is
                            taking an active part in the conferences. The result of all this seems
                            to be that the originator of the plan, Attorney General Gustavo Manrique
                            Pacanins, seems to have been relegated more or less to the background.
                            …</p>
                        <p>Mr. Proudfit of the Standard Oil Company was very much concerned about a
                            development stemming out of the speech made by the President at Zulia in
                            which he more or less committed himself to the bringing back of the
                            refining operations now located in Aruba and Curasao to Venezuela as
                            part of its national industrial development. The injecting of this
                            controversial issue into the negotiations has <pb n="811"
                                xml:id="pg_811" facs="0825"/>naturally caused a great concern in oil
                            circles because of the tremendous investments and possible loss that
                            would be entailed by such a transfer.</p>
                        <p>In my conversation with the President this subject cropped up and he
                            expressed himself in no uncertain terms as to the ultimate intentions of
                            the Venezuelan Government in this regard. I gathered that he intends to
                            insist upon some commitment from the companies that all further
                            extensions of refining operations shall be built on Venezuelan soil. I
                            tried to convince him of the wisdom of keeping this controversial
                            question out of the basic discussions now going on, but not, I felt,
                            with entire success. I feel that there is a more serious side to it than
                            just the interest in development of Venezuela’s national
                            industrialization. There is a deep-rooted and bitter feeling of
                            resentment against the Dutch in Curaçao and of course the idea that
                            these islands rightfully belong to Venezuela has strong support, but
                            even aside from this claim there exists a real enmity against the Dutch,
                            a feeling that they are unfriendly and inimical to Venezuelan interests.
                            Should this basic feeling get out of hand and become a political issue
                            it might loom up as a serious obstacle to the smooth working out of the
                            new petroleum law which is in reality a basic treaty between the
                            Government and the oil industry governing the future conduct of the
                            operations in this area.</p>
                        <p>I have recently discussed the present status of this matter with the
                            British Minister, Mr. Donald St. Clair Gainer, and while retaining his
                            optimism about the prospects for the enactment of a law along the lines
                            now contemplated, he feels that delay in this matter is likely to lead
                            to the injection of political factors which might be able to present
                            considerable opposition to the program adopted by the Government under
                            the guidance of General Medina, However, since Mr. Hoover, the senior
                            negotiator for the Venezuelan Government who is assisting in the
                            drafting of the new law returned to Caracas yesterday from the United
                            States where he has been since December 23 for purposes of consultation
                            with the interested American companies, it is hoped that consideration
                            of the remaining half of the draft of the law will proceed with
                            considerably more despatch.</p>
                        <p>To complete this picture there is enclosed herewith<note n="55"
                                xml:id="d681fn55">Enclosures not printed.</note> a translation of
                            the full text of President Medina’s address made at a public meeting in
                            Caracas on Sunday, January 17, 1943, an excerpt from which was furnished
                            in translation in my telegram No. 82 of January eighteenth.<note n="56"
                                xml:id="d681fn56">Not printed.</note> A single copy of the Spanish
                            text of President Medina’s remarks is also enclosed.</p>
                        <p>It is worthy of note that President Medina, while mentioning the <pb
                                n="812" xml:id="pg_812" facs="0826"/>overflowing enthusiasm which
                            prevailed at the meeting, stated that his responsibility required that
                            he ponder over matters and study them thoroughly adding that if he
                            permitted himself to be carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment, he
                            would not be worthy of the confidence of his listeners. Fifty thousand
                            persons are stated to have been present at the demonstration, which
                            while enthusiastic was very orderly.</p>
                        <p>Although President Medina did not detail the other problems “in need of
                            investigation by the Government” it is generally understood that he here
                            had reference to fiscal matters arising from reduced Government income
                            arising from economic factors such as reduced production of petroleum,
                            reduced imports from the United States and the effect on internal
                            economy and employment of these results of the war.</p>
                        <p>The public meeting at which the President spoke after 20 other orators
                            had delivered addresses was held under the auspices of the “Comité
                            Directivo de la Concentración de Respaldo a la Política Petrolera”

                        <p>The impetus for the formation of this committee emanated from the
                            Association of Venezuelan Writers (Asociación de Escritores Venezolanos)
                            apparently on the suggestion of high officials of the Government with
                            the view of holding a kind of public forum on the petroleum question and
                            giving to the public at large a feeling of responsibility in the
                            decisions to be made and thus anticipate some of the discussions of the
                            proposed new petroleum law which would inevitably take place in the
                            Venezuelan Congress when it is called upon to deal with this matter, and
                            thus shorten eventual discussion in that body.</p>

                            in separate audience by President Medina and given a copy of final draft
                            of the new petroleum law which the President and his special commission
                            have just finished drafting. The representatives of the largest
                            companies (Van Hasselt of the Royal Dutch and Proudfit of the Standard
                            of New Jersey) were given in addition a draft for a separate agreement
                            binding them to the construction of refineries with a capacity of 8000
                            metric tons (about 50,000 barrels) per day within 5 years after
                            termination of the war. The refining stipulation to which the companies
                            objected has been kept out of the final draft of the law.</p>
                        <p>The reaction of the heads of the leading producing companies is generally
                            favorable although each has minor changes to suggest. They have been
                            given 12 days to prepare their reply during which time the staff of the
                            Ministry of Fomento will be ready at all times to discuss details of
                            proposed modifications.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s Instruction No. 157 [<hi rend="italic">1571</hi>] of
                            December 12, 1942<note n="59" xml:id="d684fn59">Not printed; it
                                indicated that Venezuela’s coffee quota in the 1941–42 quota year
                                was 431,527 bags of which only 430,449 bags were shipped
                                (561.333D3/1437a).</note> and to report the following:</p>
                        <p>Careful consideration has been given by the Embassy to the views of the
                            Department expressed in the instruction under reference, and a number of
                            conferences on the subject have been held with the Venezuelan
                            authorities. The crux of these discussions has been the status of sales
                            contracts negotiated by Venezuelan exporters with American importers
                            prior to the establishment of minimum export prices by the Venezuelan
                            Executive Decree of November 3, 1941. Incident to this question is the
                            dispute as to quantities of coffee actually shipped by Venezuela in the
                            1941–1942 coffee year.</p>
                        <p>According to final Venezuelan official figures, the number of bags (60
                            kilograms) exported by Venezuela to the United States in the 1941–1942
                            quota year amounted to 527,216 (See December 1942 issue of “Revista del
                            Instituto Nacional del Café”, page No. 53), which represents an excess
                            of 75,689 bags over its quota of 431,527. According to the Department’s
                            Instruction under reference, receipts in the United States of Venezuelan
                            coffee for this period totalled 430,449 bags, or 1,078 short of its
                            quota.</p>
                        <p>It has been impossible at this end to determine the reason for <pb
                                n="815" xml:id="pg_815" facs="0829"/>this marked discrepancy; it
                            might have been caused by loss of shipments at sea, or divergent
                            statistical methods used by the respective export and import
                            authorities. Whatever the cause, it would seem that this question might
                            be clarified, and the methods of determining effective quota shipments
                            settled through the medium of the Inter-American Coffee Board.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the status of pre-existing contracts, it appears that the
                            Venezuelan Constitution expressly prohibits the retroactive application
                            of laws, (except with respect to questions of procedure, and with
                            respect to Laws reducing the penalty for an offense, which are given
                            immediate application). However, the Minister of Finance,<note n="60"
                                xml:id="d684fn60">Alfredo Machado Hernandez.</note> with whom this
                            question was discussed, continues to maintain that the restrictive
                            measures to which Venezuelan coffee exporters were subjected in 1941
                            (Executive Decree of February 18, 1941 requiring export licenses, and
                            Executive Decree of November 3, 1941 establishing minimum prices for
                            export), confronted them with a <hi rend="italic">force majeure</hi>
                            situation which would justify non-fulfilment of preexisting contracts,
                            in spite of the constitutional provision above referred to. Dr. Machado,
                            the Finance Minister, admitted that there were arguments on the other
                            side as well, based on the desirability of maintaining the <hi
                                rend="italic">bona fides</hi> of contracts, and good-will between
                            the respective national parties.</p>
                        <p>He suggested, therefore, that this question of the pre-existing contracts
                            be submitted to arbitration. The question of arbitration was then
                            discussed with Sr. De. Tovar, Director of the Instituto Nacional del
                            Café, who concurred in Dr. Machado’s proposal and also believed that the
                            individual exporters concerned would likewise accept the idea. Sr. De.
                            Tovar will consult the exporters to obtain their reactions, and will
                            advise the Embassy of the results. The proposal is: that the Coffee
                            Institute, in agreement with the Venezuelan exporters concerned, should
                            appoint one arbitrator, the American coffee importers involved in such
                            contracts to appoint an arbitrator on their side, and these two to
                            select a third as chairman, the meeting to be held in New York, the
                            decision of the arbitrators to be final and accepted without recourse by
                            both sides; any expense involved in the arbitration to be borne equally
                            by the two sides.</p>
                        <p>If this proposal is acceptable to the American importers concerned and
                            they are prepared to act upon it, the Department is requested to advise
                            the Embassy as promptly as possible, when steps will be taken at once to
                            effect the appointment of the Venezuelan arbitrator, through the Coffee
                            Institute in order that the arbitration may take place without further
                            delay.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State refers to the Embassy’s despatch no. 3923 of
                            February 1, 1943 on the subject “Issues Arising from Venezuelan Coffee
                            Control Measures”, in which reference is made to the suggestion of the
                            Venezuelan Minister of Finance that existing difficulties between
                            Venezuelan exporters and American importers be submitted to
                            arbitration.</p>
                        <p>This same problem is now under active discussion in New York between a
                            committee representing American importers and Mr. Alarcon, representing
                            Alarcon Hermanos. In this connection there are transcribed below
                            comments which the chairman of this committee has made under date of

                        <p>In the light of the foregoing information, the Department believes it

                            the question to be made by the interested parties, without the active
                            intervention of the Embassy in the matter. It is assumed that the
                            responsible Venezuelan authorities are in touch with Alarcon Hermanos
                            and any other Venezuelan firms that may be affected, and will be glad to

                        <p>He stated that it is perfectly true that New York as well as other
                            Atlantic ports are rather fully occupied at present to the extent that
                            it is not desired to run additional vessels to them. Probably most of
                            the UK<note n="61" xml:id="d686fn61">United Kingdom.</note> cargo goes
                            through New York and you will recall that recently the press carried a
                            story of shortage of water-front labor there. He indicated that it would
                            probably not be possible to give <pb n="817" xml:id="pg_817" facs="0831"
                            />much consideration to the Venezuelan request as long as the Atlantic
                            ports were so occupied.</p>
                        <p>In response to my inquiry as to services from Colombia, he informed me
                            that only about ten per cent of the Colombian coffee from the north
                            coast came to New York, and that was by transshipment at the Canal. Most
                            of the Colombian west coast coffee, however, comes into New York. It
                            would appear, therefore, that the Colombian area adjoining Venezuela
                            have very little advantage in this respect.</p>

                            Excellency the Secretary of State and has the honor to advise him of the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>By note No. 3009 of the ninth instant,<note n="62" xml:id="d687fn62">Note
                                of August 9, not printed.</note> the Embassy referred to the
                            difficult situation with which the coffee operations of Venezuela are
                            confronted in view of the fact that the greater part of the steamers
                            sailing from Venezuela, with coffee shipments, arrive at New Orleans or
                            Mobile and not at New York, which is the principal and traditional
                            market for the sale of our coffee. On the other hand, the vessels which
                            come from Brazil and Colombia arrive directly at New York.</p>
                        <p>The payment of the railway freight for the transportation of Venezuelan
                            coffee from New Orleans or Mobile to New York was absorbed to the extent
                            of 75%, under certain conditions, by the Commodity Credit Corporation,
                            thereby providing relief as regards expenditures.</p>
                        <p>The situation has now become much more difficult due to the fact that, as
                            of August 25 last, the Commodity Credit Corporation eliminated the
                            subsidy which it had been paying to the coffee trade. Consequently, the
                            payment of 75% of the freight over the land route New Orleans or
                            Mobile—New York is completely eliminated for the future.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the situation with respect to the sale of our
                            coffee is now becoming increasingly difficult and is causing, as a
                            result, harm to Venezuelan economy, the Chargé d’Affaires of Venezuela
                            will be very grateful to His Excellency the Secretary of State for the
                            cooperation which he may be able to give with a view to arranging for
                            the transportation of our coffee intended for the United States directly
                            from Venezuelan ports to New York, thus placing us on an equal footing
                            with Colombia and Brazil, whose coffees arrive directly at that
                            port.</p>

                            25, 1943<note n="63" xml:id="d688fn63">Not printed.</note> you indicated
                            that it would not be practicable or advisable to permit direct vessel
                            service from Venezuela to New York, as had been requested by the
                            Venezuelan Ambassador in a communication to the Department of August 9,
                                1943.<note n="63" xml:id="d688fn64">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>In view of the importance to Venezuela of such direct shipments,
                            particularly with reference to the movement of coffee to this market in
                            competition with other countries, the matter has been the subject of
                            further oral discussion between officials of the Department and the War
                            Shipping Administration in order to see if a more satisfactory reply
                            could not be made to the Venezuelan Government. In the meantime another
                            communication has been received from the Venezuelan Embassy dated
                            September 6, 1943, a translation of which is attached,<note n="64"
                                xml:id="d688fn65"><hi rend="italic">Supra.</hi></note> again urging
                            that some action be taken on the matter. The Venezuelan Embassy now
                            points out that as a result of the recent cancellation of the subsidy on
                            railway freight previously granted by the Commodity Credit Corporation,
                            the added cost of hauling coffee overland from New Orleans or Mobile to
                            New York prejudices still further the position of Venezuelan coffee.</p>
                        <p>The total tonnage of coffee involved in the Venezuelan request is not,
                            relatively speaking, very large, in as much as the entire Venezuelan
                            coffee quota for the United States during the coming quota year is only
                            462,000 bags of 60 Kgs. each. In view of the small tonnage involved and
                            bearing in mind the strain under which our interior rail transportation
                            is now operating, I should be most grateful if you would give
                            reconsideration to the Venezuelan request in the light of the new
                            circumstances set forth in the Venezuelan communication of September 6,
                            1943.</p>

                            Ambassador of Venezuela and has the honor to refer to the latter’s
                            communication of August 9, 1943,<note n="66" xml:id="d689fn66">Not
                                printed.</note> and to a subsequent communication from the Chargé
                            d’Affaires, dated September 6, 1943, regarding the hardship suffered by
                            the Venezuelan coffee industry because of the necessity for shipping
                            Venezuelan coffee to the ports of Mobile and New Orleans, rather than
                            directly to New York.</p>
                        <p>This problem was taken up with the War Shipping Administration on the
                            basis of the first of the two communications referred to above, and a
                            letter was received in reply from that agency in which it was stated
                            that the need for the facilities of the United States North Atlantic
                            ports for vessels in military and naval services, under existing
                            conditions, was such that it was not practicable or advisable to
                            transfer additional civil or commercial vessel service to those
                            ports.</p>
                        <p>The matter was further discussed with officials of the War Shipping
                            Administration, and the new circumstances referred to in the Embassy’s
                            memorandum of September 6, 1943 brought to the attention of that agency.
                            After careful reconsideration, the War Shipping Administration addressed
                            a further letter to the Department of State, dated September 30, 1943, a
                            copy of which is attached,<note n="66" xml:id="d689fn67">Not
                                printed.</note> maintaining the position that at this time it is
                            impracticable to add additional commercial vessel service to North
                            Atlantic ports.</p>
                        <p>In recognition of the interest of the Government of Venezuela in this
                            matter, the Department will continue to give it its active attention, in
                            cooperation with the War Shipping Administration, in the hope that as
                            soon as military and naval requirements may justify such action it will
                            be possible to satisfy fully the request of the Venezuelan Embassy.</p>

                            Resolution VII, the Venezuelan Government should be willing to take
                            appropriate steps to remove undesirable officers and employees from the
                            staff of the railroad, and to block the severance payments to which they
                            may be entitled. It is recognized that some difficulties may be
                            encountered in connection with replacement of undesirable technical
                            personnel. However, it is believed that satisfactory measures can be
                            worked out by the Venezuelan Government in consultation with the
                            Embassy.</p>
                        <p>As you know, it is the policy of this Government, in so far as it is
                            consistent with the broad requirements of hemispheric defense, to
                            furnish materials essential to the maintenance of the vital public
                            utilities of the other American republics. Accordingly, you may assure
                                <pb n="821" xml:id="pg_821" facs="0835"/>the Venezuelan Government
                            that, if the payments to the Spanish agents are made in funds blocked
                            for the duration of the war, and if appropriate steps are taken with
                            respect to undesirable personnel, any application for the export of
                            supplies necessary to the maintenance of the railroad will be promptly
                            and sympathetically considered in the light of similar requirements by
                            other comparably vital enterprises which are free from Axis
                            influence.</p>
                        <p>However, if, as indicated in the Embassy’s despatch, it is not proposed
                            to block the proceeds of the sale, and the sale will therefore result in
                            making available free credits to the German owners, it is the
                            Department’s view that the transaction would be prejudicial to
                            hemispheric security. The danger would, of course, be aggravated if
                            payment were made in Spanish or Swiss currency. The Department
                            understands that in discussions with the Venezuelan authorities
                            concerning the problem raised by the German ownership and control of
                            this railroad, the Embassy has repeatedly urged that the proceeds of any
                            sale should be effectively blocked, and it is felt that any recession
                            from this position would undermine all future attempts to stimulate the
                            implementation of the Washington resolutions by the Venezuelan
                            Government with a view to remedying the existing deficiencies in
                            Venezuelan control measures. These deficiencies have, as you know, been
                            a source of grave concern to the Department. Accordingly, it appears
                            highly desirable that the Embassy maintain its position with respect to
                            the blocking of the funds in the present case.</p>
                        <p>You will note from the Venezuelan memorandum that the Venezuelan
                            Government apparently feels that two problems would be raised by any
                            taking over of the railroad other than by voluntary transfer: (1) the
                            problem of adequate legal authority; and (2) the possibility that the
                            valuation of the railroad by a board of experts, which apparently would
                            be required in connection with a forced sale, might be considerably
                            higher than the price at which the railroad is now being offered.</p>
                        <p>If a forced sale is required to secure blocking of the proceeds, and if
                            the issue of confiscation is raised by the Venezuelan authorities, it
                            would appear desirable discreetly to point out that confiscation is not
                            necessary in order for Venezuela to eliminate the Axis interests in
                            fulfillment of her inter-American commitments, since a forced transfer
                            with blocking of compensation would be adequate, and would not
                            constitute confiscation. In this connection you may wish to inquire
                            whether Article 4 of Decree No. 93, promulgated on May 7, 1942, which
                            authorizes the requisitioning of Venezuelan railroads when such action
                            is necessary in the interest of that nation’s transportation, does not
                            afford an adequate legal basis for a forced transfer. If it does <pb
                                n="822" xml:id="pg_822" facs="0836"/>not, you may wish to suggest
                            the desirability of a new enabling decree pursuant to Article 36 of the
                            Venezuelan Constitution.<note n="70" xml:id="d690fn70">This provides for
                                a limitation on the suspending of civil guarantees except in defense
                                of the nation.</note></p>
                        <p>With respect to the possibility that a forced transfer of the railroad
                            (in proceedings comparable to those taken against the German and Italian
                            ships to which reference is made in the memorandum) might involve
                            greater costs, it would appear desirable to inquire whether, under
                            Venezuelan law, the price at which the owners were willing to sell
                            voluntarily would not be the best evidence of the value of the railroad,
                            and, therefore, the maximum amount of compensation which would be
                            allowed in legal proceedings.</p>
                        <p>You may also wish to consider the desirability of suggesting to the
                            Venezuelan Government that in view of the character of this railroad’s
                            ownership and the danger inherent therein to the security of Venezuela
                            and of the hemisphere, this Government is prepared to assist the
                            Venezuelan Government to avoid excessive payment on behalf of the Axis
                            interests by including the railroad in the Proclaimed List. Such action
                            would probably drive down the value of the railroad in any legal
                            proceedings incident to a forced sale. Moreover, the listing of the
                            railroad would strengthen the legal basis for a forced sale by making it
                            clear that the supplies essential to continuance of service would not be
                            furnished by the United States, In this connection, the Department
                            recognizes the practical difficulties that might be occasioned by
                            listing, and suggests that listing be proposed only in aid of the
                            Venezuelan desire to nationalize the railroad on terms most advantageous
                            to the Venezuelan Government, Any listing would, of course, have to be
                            synchronized with legal proceedings designed to effect the forced
                            transfer of the railroad. It would assist the Department in dealing with
                            this problem if you would indicate whether the railroad presently
                            carries materials required by our war effort.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the statement in the Venezuelan memorandum that the
                            railroad is “property of a company which is a national of a country like
                            Spain which is not only not at war with the Allied Nations, but which
                            maintains normal relations with Venezuela”, the Department invites your
                            attention to the Censorship Intercept forwarded to the Embassy on
                            January 14, 1943,<note n="71" xml:id="d690fn71">Not found in Department
                                files.</note> which discloses the fact that the Spanish Diplomatic
                            Pouch has been used to keep the Venezuelan railroad in communication
                            with Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Finally, you may wish to evidence the Department’s sympathetic interest
                            in the maintenance of this vital public utility by inquiring whether the
                            schedule of materials and spare parts essential for repair <pb n="823"
                                xml:id="pg_823" facs="0837"/>and maintenance submitted by the Gran

                            was enclosed in the Embassy’s report no. 34, under date of September 18,
                                1942,<note n="72" xml:id="d690fn72">Not printed.</note> is still
                            current. In the event that a satisfactory plan is worked out, a current

                            helpful in expediting any assistance which the Department is able to
                            give.</p>
                        <p>The attitude of the Department toward the proposed transfer will also be
                            set forth in conversations which will be held with representatives of
                            the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington.</p>

                        <p>The Department of State views with sympathetic interest the desire of the
                            Venezuelan Government to nationalize the railroad which runs between
                            Caracas and Valencia. This railroad, as presently owned and controlled,
                            is deemed by this Government to endanger hemispheric security, and the
                            Department desires, within the framework of the common objectives of
                            hemispheric defense, to cooperate fully with the Government of Venezuela
                            in connection with a plan to eliminate from this railroad all interests
                            or personnel prejudicial to hemispheric defense.</p>
                        <p>It is the view of this Government, however, that any transfer which would
                            make free funds available to the German owners of the railroad, would be
                            extremely prejudicial to hemispheric security. This Department is
                            confident that the Venezuelan Government fully realizes the value to the
                            Axis of a direct payment in free funds and the danger inherent therein
                            to the security of this hemisphere. Accordingly, it is assumed that if
                            the German owners of the railroad refuse to accept payment in funds
                            effectively blocked for the duration of the war, the Venezuelan
                            Government intends to effect the replacement of the Axis ownership on
                            some basis other than a voluntary sale.</p>
                        <p>It is noted that the memorandum from the Venezuelan Embassy<note n="74"
                                xml:id="d691fn74">No. 67, not printed.</note> suggests that the
                            nominal ownership of the railroad by a Spanish national may impede
                            nationalization in the event that the German interests are unwilling to
                            agree to a transfer with blocked proceeds. <pb n="824" xml:id="pg_824"
                                facs="0838"/>In this connection, it appears appropriate to state
                            that the whole inter-American control program embodied in the
                            Resolutions adopted at the Rio<note n="75" xml:id="d691fn75">For text of

                            rests on the standard of real, as distinguished from formal, ownership
                            and control. This standard was deemed necessary for the protection of
                            hemispheric security because the aggressor nations have assiduously
                            attempted, and are continuing to attempt to elude effective control by
                            establishing fictitious forms of ownership. The American republics would
                            be submitting to this obvious Axis stratagem, with serious detriment to
                            the security of this hemisphere, if they should fail to search for, and
                            to act in the light of, the realities of ownership, in the
                            administration of their control measures. In view of these
                            considerations, the fact that legal title is in a Spanish national will
                            not, the Department is confident, preclude the Venezuelan Government
                            from taking such measures with respect to the railroad as are required
                            by hemispheric security.</p>
                        <p>The Department notes from the memorandum under reference that the
                            railroad is in need of maintenance equipment. It is the desire of this
                            Government to reduce to a minimum any inconvenience which may result to
                            the Venezuelan economy through the application of controls upon the
                            export of material from the United States. As the Venezuelan Government
                            will appreciate, however, these controls must be applied in the light of
                            the broad objectives of hemispheric defense, and of the requirements of
                            enterprises which leave no doubt as to their complete loyalty to these
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>This Government will be pleased to receive such further comments as the
                            Venezuelan Government may wish to present with reference to the plan for
                            nationalization of this railroad.</p>

                        <p>A–418. The Venezuelan Embassy has informally requested the views of the
                            Department on the contemplated forced conversion of Axis frozen assets
                            in Venezuelan banks into Venezuelan Government bonds.</p>
                        <pb n="825" xml:id="pg_825" facs="0839"/>
                        <p>The Department would appreciate having the Embassy’s comments on this
                            proposal. Relevant considerations would seem to be (1) comparison of
                            interest rates as between blocked accounts and bonds; (2) the necessity
                            for financing the proposed bond issue through conversion of frozen
                            assets; (3) the possibility that increased revenue to undesirables, even
                            though blocked, would increase their willingness to finance undesirable
                            activities with their free funds. From such information as the
                            Department has available, it would seem that the genesis of this
                            proposal may well be pressure brought on the Venezuelan Government by
                            the owners of blocked accounts.</p>
                        <p>For the Embassy’s information, the Department interposed no objection to
                            the forced conversion of blocked accounts in Costa Rica into Costa Rican
                            Government bonds.</p>

                                rend="italic">Letras del Tesoro</hi>) first came to the attention of
                            the Embassy when two Germans whose funds are controlled by the Executive
                            Decrees <pb n="826" xml:id="pg_826" facs="0840"/>under reference
                            requested of the Minister of Finance (Hacienda) that these funds be
                            invested in Treasury bills. The matter was referred to the Venezuelan
                            Consultative Commission and, when raised in consultation with the
                            Representatives of the Embassy, the Commission itself determined that
                            this should not be permitted. (Reference is made to page 2 of the
                            enclosure No. 2 to Embassy Despatch No. 3494 dated November 21,
                                1942.)<note n="77" xml:id="d693fn77">Neither printed.</note> It is
                            understood that Venezuela has not found it necessary to raise funds by
                            the issuance of Government securities for some fifty years until the
                            issue of Bs. 4,500,000. was sold in November, 1942. The inquiry made of
                            the Ministry of Hacienda, hereinabove referred to, was with regard to
                            this issue.</p>
                        <p>In February, 1943, a second issue in the amount of Bs. 5,000,000. was
                            sold and about that time the Superintendent of Banks, Dr. Ernesto G.
                            Permuy, approached the office of the Commercial Attaché to this Embassy
                            and explained that one of the purposes of issuing Treasury bills was to
                            combat the inflationary trend of Venezuelan currency, hence the
                            Government preferred that the issue be purchased by the public generally
                            rather than by commercial banks in Venezuela, and stated that all
                            Proclaimed List firms of any financial significance, in addition to
                            having withdrawn considerable cash from their bank deposits just prior
                            to the effective date of the Venezuelan Decrees, carried on their
                            businesses on a strictly cash basis and maintained considerable funds in
                            cash in their respective safes and cash drawers. He added that he had
                            exerted his best efforts by persuasion to get these funds deposited in
                            local banks but his efforts had proven fruitless in that he did not have
                            the legal authority to oblige it and the parties concerned refused to
                            comply with his requests. He felt, however, that these firms might be
                            inclined to invest a part of these funds in Treasury bills and he
                            requested the attitude of the American Authorities with regard thereto.
                            It is known to be a fact that these firms maintain considerable amounts
                            in Venezuelan currency in their cash drawers. The recent balance sheet
                            of Frey &amp; Company (PL) shows a cash balance of Bs. 250,000.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>It is understood that the Commercial Banks in Venezuela have offered to
                            purchase the entire output of Treasury bills but, as hereinabove stated,
                            it is preferred that the general public make such purchases. Although it
                            has been made public in each instance that the issue was
                            over-subscribed, such does not truly reflect the facts in that of each
                            issue the Government was obliged to sell to Commercial Banks from Bs.
                            1,000,000. to Bs. 1,500,000. worth. This has been partially explained in
                            that the general public in Venezuela is not educated in <pb n="827"
                                xml:id="pg_827" facs="0841"/>the matter of investing in Government
                            securities. Therefore, with regard to item numbered (2) on relevant
                            considerations in the Airgram under reference, although it should not be
                            necessary for the financing of the bill issues to utilize Axis frozen
                            assets, the Venezuelan Government would probably welcome this
                            possibility in order to reduce that part of the issue purchased by
                            Commercial Banks.</p>
                        <p>With regard to item numbered (3) on relevant considerations of the
                            possibility that increased revenue to listed parties, even though
                            blocked, would increase their willingness to finance undesirable
                            activities with their free funds, any expression by the Embassy would be
                            purely conjectural, in that all Venezuelan firms of any significance
                            included in the Proclaimed List have sufficient free funds, so that any
                            such inducement by reason of permission to invest in these Government
                            bills probably would be insignificant.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>It is the Embassy’s considered opinion that no concession should be made
                            on this score unless the Venezuelan control of undesirables is
                            strengthened. It is recalled that the Venezuelan Control Decrees were
                            enacted prior to the Conferences at Rio de Janeiro and Washington, and
                            although the law as written was considered satisfactory, its
                            administration is quite ineffective. If the means proposed can be used
                            to oblige the investment of <hi rend="italic">cash</hi> held by
                            undesirable persons and firms in Venezuelan Treasury bills and the
                            interest accruing thereon, as well as the principal collected upon
                            maturity, is effectively controlled by the Venezuelan Government, the
                            proposal may well be given serious consideration. If the proposal is
                            meant to include only those funds specially blocked as a result of the
                            Consultative procedure, it is suggested that the Department should
                            refuse its approval. If the proposal has reference to those funds
                            controlled under the Decrees of December 11 and 16, 1941, which is
                            doubted, it is suggested likewise that the proposal be considered
                            unfavorably.</p>
                        <p>This request for the Department’s views may well lend itself to a reply
                            forcefully suggesting a strengthening of local Controls which by a
                            considerable number of important people here is believed to be all that
                            is necessary for the Venezuelan Government to aggressively approach the
                            problem of Economic Warfare. The very fact that the views of the
                            Department are requested in this regard lends credence to this
                            belief.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that reliable
                            information obtained by the Embassy indicates that commercial banking
                            institutions in Venezuela, although probably extending no new credits to
                            Proclaimed List Nationals, do continue to maintain the lines of
                            commercial credit which were available to such Proclaimed List Nationals
                            at the time of their inclusion in the List. It would seem therefore
                            that, with the exception of obtaining new credits, persons and firms
                            included in the Proclaimed List have available to them normal banking
                            facilities much as they had prior to their inclusion in the List;
                            furthermore, this procedure is foreseen and approved by the Venezuelan
                            Authorities under Articles 3 and 4 of the Executive Decree of December
                            11, 1941, as evidenced by the monthly issuance of licenses by the Banco
                            Central de Venezuela to the Commercial Banks authorizing the continuance
                            of such credits.</p>
                        <p>It is understood and believed that the various commercial bankers in
                            Venezuela are pro-Allied in political sympathy, and most of them have
                            indicated to members of the Embassy staff a personal desire to terminate
                            such credits made available to Proclaimed List Nationals and to call in
                            outstanding obligations from them; but they indicate hesitancy to take
                            this step in view of the fact that these transactions are not prohibited
                            by the Venezuelan Controls and, as indicated, are specifically approved
                            by the licensing operations of the Banco Central. Several of them have
                            said they would welcome some concrete evidence of concern regarding this
                            situation on the part of the Embassy on which they could base a step in
                            this direction.</p>
                        <p>For this purpose, Mr. Groves, Counselor of Embassy for Economic Affairs,
                            addressed a letter dated March 16 (transmitted as Enclosure No. 1 to
                            this Despatch<note n="78" xml:id="d694fn78">Not printed.</note>) to the
                            Superintendent of Banks, calling attention to this situation and
                            pointing out that the practice would seem to contravene the spirit, if

                            Ministers in January 1942, as well as the recommendations adopted at the
                            Inter-American Conference on Systems of Economic and Financial Control,
                            in Washington last July. Furthermore, it has been pointed out verbally
                            to the Superintendent of Banks that utilizing American credit via the
                            local Banks to support business operations of Proclaimed List firms
                            contravenes our Trading with the Enemy Act just as much as would the
                            sale of American steel to a Proclaimed List firm by a local
                            importer.</p>

                        <p>The Superintendent of Banks has called a meeting of the commercial bank
                            managers for March 23, at which the question of extending credit
                            facilities to Proclaimed List firms will be discussed, and presumably
                            the banks’ policy in this regard determined. The Embassy has verbally
                            suggested to the Superintendent of Banks that the commercial credits
                            outstanding in favor of Proclaimed List firms or individuals may be
                            liquidated gradually over a period of perhaps six months at the outside,
                            in order that problem of unemployment and other disturbance to the
                            national economy be minimized as far as possible.<note n="79"
                                xml:id="d694fn79">The Ambassador reported in his despatch No. 4444,
                                May 27, 1943, that 14 banks concluded on May 12, 1943, an agreement
                                to eliminate, in a period of nine months, all credit facilities

                            this process might result in the entire elimination from Venezuelan

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Welles</hi>: Dr. Parra Pérez<note n="80"
                                xml:id="d695fn80">Caracciolo Parra Pérez, Venezuelan Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs.</note> today requested that I write to you
                            regarding the desire of the Venezuelan Government to purchase the
                            railroad which runs from Valencia to Caracas. This is normally and
                            legally a Spanish-owned company but the majority interest is known to be
                            German. The heavily interested Spaniard has a Venezuelan wife. The
                            Venezuelan Government desires to obtain the railroad by purchase since
                            any other more summary procedure would raise an issue with Spain, a
                            neutral country with which Venezuela has consistently maintained close
                            and friendly relations regardless of the transitory character of its
                            recent Governments. If they took over the property they would then have
                            to submit to an evaluation which the Minister thinks would reach or
                            exceed 50 million Bolivars, whereas it could probably be bought for
                            around 5 million Bolivars in free Spanish exchange.</p>
                        <p>In a few words, the Minister wants our help in getting a bargain for the
                            nation. A balance must be struck between the evil of leaving this
                            important strategic railroad in Axis hands and the evil that would come
                            from allotting to the owners the amount of free exchange <pb n="830"
                                xml:id="pg_830" facs="0844"/>required for outright and immediate
                            purchase. The funds would most likely remain in Spain or Venezuela as a
                            hedge against post war conditions on the part of the owners.</p>
                        <p>Could an exception be made in funds control in this case in view of the
                            other important considerations?</p>

                            365 from Maracaibo dated December 24<note n="82" xml:id="d696fn82">Not
                                printed.</note> concerning efforts made by pro-Nazi elements in
                            Venezuela to obtain publicity adverse to the Proclaimed List and to
                            discredit it in the eyes of the Venezuelan public.</p>
                        <p>The Department believes that it is desirable to consider possible steps
                            to meet attempts of this nature and, in addition, to obtain as wide a
                            distribution of the Proclaimed List as may be practicable for the
                            purpose of securing its widespread observance by the Venezuelan public
                            and to assure that Venezuelans have an adequate realization of the
                            purposes and significance of the Proclaimed List program. Two things
                            specifically would appear to be possible at this time.</p>
                        <p>The first would be an augmenting of the efforts to distribute copies of
                            the list in Venezuela. Your despatch no. 3299 of October 26, 1942<note
                                n="82" xml:id="d696fn83">Not printed.</note> indicates that only 200
                            copies of the list are regularly duplicated and that considerably less
                            than this find their way into the hands of Venezuelan individuals and
                            firms. This number is considerably less proportionately than the number
                            distributed by other missions. It is, therefore, suggested that you
                            consider the feasibility of making a wider distribution of the list to
                            business concerns, chambers of commerce, druggists, doctors, banks,
                            trucking companies, forwarding and dispatching agents, shipping
                            companies, pro-democratic and other appropriate organizations, citizens
                            of the United States, and particularly to all individuals or companies
                            who are believed to be trading with listed firms.</p>
                        <p>It is further suggested that members of your staff discreetly enlist the
                            cooperation of persons of known pro-allied sympathies in publicizing the
                            objectives of the Proclaimed List. It is recognized that any publicity
                            sponsored officially by the Embassy would be discounted as self-serving
                            and that what this Government does with the Proclaimed list is less open
                            to attack than anything said in defense of such action. However,
                            wherever it is deemed feasible to channel information to <pb n="831"
                                xml:id="pg_831" facs="0845"/>reliable Venezuelan newspaper men,
                            radio commentators, and others ho formulate public opinion, it would
                            seem desirable to do so. In the Department’s view, such publicity should
                            stress the economic and propaganda interpenetration of the American
                            republics by Axis agents; the hazard to the security of the hemisphere
                            through the continuance of such activities; the fact that the amount of
                            goods exported to Venezuela has been determined by supply considerations
                            and available: shipping space, and that only the distribution of this
                            over-all fixed total has been affected by the existence of the
                            Proclaimed List; that shipping shortages are directly related to the
                            subversive activities of the Axis in this hemisphere. With respect to
                            injuries to the Venezuelan economy through the application of United
                            States export controls, it is the earnest desire of this Government to
                            reduce to a minimum any inconvenience to the Venezuelan economy; such
                            controls must, however, be exercised in the light of the broad
                            objectives of hemispheric security and of the requirements of
                            enterprises whose loyalty to these objectives is unquestioned.</p>

                            Mendoza, Elisa Mendoza de Rodríguez Azpúrua and the heirs of Luis Nuñez.
                            The total amount owing is approximately 100,000 French Francs, which
                            must be paid as soon as possible inasmuch as the French authorities
                            threaten to proceed to auction off the debtors’ property.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Ambassador</hi>: I have given the most
                            careful study to your letter of March 17 in which you refer to Dr. Parra
                            Pérez’ request regarding the railroad which runs between Caracas and
                            Valencia. It is my understanding that Dr. Parra Pérez has asked us to
                            approve the purchase by the Venezuela Government of this railroad even
                            though free funds are paid to the Germans who own a majority interest.
                            As you know, I am anxious to resolve every doubt in favor of granting
                            any request made by Dr. Parra Pérez. In this case, however, although all
                            of us here in the Department feel that the nationalization of this
                            railroad and the elimination of its undesirable personnel would be
                            highly desirable, we cannot approve its acquisition on the terms
                            proposed by Dr. Parra Pérez.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty is that the problem is not the narrow one of striking a
                            balance between the evil of leaving the railroad in Axis hands and the
                            evil of supplying foreign exchange to our enemies. Our approval of this
                            transaction would, I believe, constitute a violation of our commitments
                            to hemispheric security. As a signatory to the Rio and Washington
                            Resolutions, this Government is pledged to avoid transactions which will
                            make free foreign exchange available to the aggressor nations. Our
                            approval in this case (with its implicit promise that equipment
                            necessary for the maintenance of the road would be furnished) and the
                            consequent increase of Axis resources, would not differ in essence from
                            a direct remittance of foreign exchange from the United States to
                            Germany in clear contravention of our Inter-American commitments.</p>
                        <p>A second broad aspect of the problem is that our approval of the proposed
                            transaction would, I believe, undermine all attempts to secure effective
                            economic controls in Venezuela. As you know, the railroad is popularly
                            known as the “German railroad”; its present ownership and personnel are
                            a threat to Venezuelan and hemispheric <pb n="833" xml:id="pg_833"
                                facs="0847"/>security; it is a symbol, in a sense, of the kind of
                            enterprise which the American republics have declared to be inimical to
                            their security, and have agreed to purge of Axis influence. For these
                            reasons, you and your staff have energetically sought to bring about the
                            sale of this railroad against blocked funds, and in this effort, you
                            have received the firm support of the Department. For us to reverse our
                            position at this point, and, in effect, to sanction action by the
                            Venezuelan Government which would permit the local agents of the
                            railroad to make foreign exchange available to the Axis, would, I am
                            convinced, irreparably prejudice the integrity of economic controls in
                            Venezuela by furnishing an undesirable precedent that could be exploited
                            by Axis firms as a reason for their being freed from any controls that
                            now exist or may be established.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I cannot believe that the choice lies inescapably between
                            leaving the railroad in Axis hands and making free funds available to
                            the German owners, for I am confident that both evils can be avoided if
                            the Venezuelan Government is prepared to exercise its sovereign power in
                            order to discharge its Inter-American commitments.</p>
                        <p>We have not been unmindful of the difficulties to which Dr. Parra Pérez
                            makes reference. Both in the Department’s instruction no. 1732 of
                            February 23, and in Mr. Acheson’s conversation with Dr. Escalante, the
                            possibility of driving down the valuation of the railroad in forced
                            transfer proceedings by the use of the Proclaimed List was suggested for
                            the consideration of the Venezuelan Government. I am enclosing for your
                            information copies of the memorandum which was handed by Mr. Acheson to
                            Dr. Escalante,<note n="85" xml:id="d698fn85">Dated March 2, <ref
                                    target="#pg_823">p. 823</ref>.</note> and the memorandum of
                            their conversation.<note n="86" xml:id="d698fn86">Not printed.</note> We
                            appreciate as well the problem raised by the nominal Spanish ownership.
                            We have faced that problem repeatedly in this country, and have never
                            permitted formal devices involving nationals of friendly countries, or
                            even co-belligerent countries, to prevent our taking whatever steps were
                            required by our security and the security of the hemisphere. Venezuela
                            has pledged herself, through the Rio and Washington Resolutions, to do
                            no less.</p>
                        <p>I realize that it is a matter of great delicacy and difficulty to reject
                            this request. However, I am confident that if you will present these
                            considerations again to Dr. Parra Pérez, he will understand the
                            impossibility of our taking any other course, and will appreciate as
                            well the imperative necessity for Venezuela’s taking appropriate
                            measures against the railroad.</p>
                        <p>Believe me, with kindest regards.</p>

                            Excellency’s esteemed note No. 02005–E of April 14, 1943, concerning the
                            contemplated remittance of certain funds to the Swiss Government for use
                            in paying municipal taxes in Paris on the property of four Venezuelan
                            citizens named in the note cited.</p>
                        <p>The inquiry of the Venezuelan Government was communicated to the
                            Department of State and I am now in receipt of the reply informing me
                            that for the following reasons the State Department considers it very
                            undesirable that the remittance be made: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>It would furnish to the enemy badly needed foreign exchange
                                    and involve a direct contribution to the enemy;</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Although the amount in this case is small, a dangerous
                                    precedent would be established if the contemplated remittance
                                    were to be made.</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
                                <item>It is the view of the State Department that the remittance
                                    would not be in consonance with Resolution No. 1 of the
                                    Washington Conference. The State Department added that in view
                                    of its commitment under the Resolution cited, the United States
                                    Government does not allow remittances for purposes of this
                                    nature to be made by its own citizens.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In communicating to Your Excellency the above expressed views of the
                            Department of State, I have been requested to add that accordingly my
                            Government does not find it possible to authorize the use of its
                            facilities for the remittance contemplated and at the same time to
                            express to Your Excellency the hope of my Government that upon
                            reexamination of the matter in the light of the Washington Resolutions,
                            the Venezuelan Government may find it possible to reconsider its
                            position.</p>

                        <p>338. Further discussions between Ambassador Corrigan and officers of the
                            Department have developed the following considerations with respect to
                            the German Railroad: (1) Because of the strategic location <pb n="836"
                                xml:id="pg_836" facs="0850"/>of the German Railroad, whose lines run
                            along the seacoast at an average distance of 20 miles inland, the Axis
                            may be using the Railroad to obtain information regarding ship
                            movements. (2) More important, subversive elements may be using the
                            special communication facilities of the Railroad to transmit information
                            relating to ship movements in order to guide U-boat attacks against our
                            shipping. (3) In connection with its purchase of the German Railroad,
                            the Venezuelan Government would probably remove the undesirable
                            personnel, thereby eliminating the Railroad’s espionage activities.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, it has been suggested that the purchase of the
                            Railroad by the Venezuelan Government, even though against free currency
                            in Europe, would promote the war effort. The Embassy is well aware of
                            the compelling considerations which have militated against our approving
                            such a sale. In order to permit the balancing of the espionage aspects
                            against the other aspects of the proposed transactions, it is requested
                            that the Legal Attaché, the Naval Attaché and the Military Attaché
                            prepare promptly a joint report on the following points: (1) Evidence
                            relating to the actual use of the Railroad for espionage purposes,
                            including the means used to transmit information relating to ship
                            movements. (2) Evidence indicating the particular personnel within the
                            Railroad responsible for espionage. (3) Whether Axis intelligence within
                            Venezuela would be able effectively to obtain and transmit the
                            information regarding ship movements through facilities other than the
                            German Railroad (e.g. through port observers, et cetera) if the
                            Venezuelan Government removed undesirable personnel. (4) The specific
                            Railroad personnel whom the Venezuelan Government should be requested to
                            dismiss in connection with any possible approval of the purchase in
                            question. (5) Any other conditions which should be suggested to preclude
                            the use of the Railroad for subversive purposes. (6) Any other pertinent
                            information.</p>
                        <p>In connection with this report, it should be observed that the
                            Department’s files contain no information regarding actual espionage
                            activities by the Railroad. Accordingly, full documentation is
                            requested.</p>

                            to the matter of American Oil Companies or their subsidiaries being
                            obliged to furnish domestically processed products to Proclaimed List
                            Nationals.</p>
                        <p>Although conditions prevailed in 1942 prompting the licensing of American
                            Oil companies or their subsidiaries in Venezuela to furnish domestically
                            processed products to Proclaimed List Nationals, it was anticipated that
                            effective control as contemplated by Resolutions V and VII adopted at
                            the Washington Conference on Systems of Economic and Financial Control
                            would solve the problem. Such hopes were ill founded and efforts toward
                            more effective control unavailing, so much so that in January, 1943, the
                            Embassy was obliged to permit the sale of fuel oil to Gustavo Zingg y
                            Cia., (PL) Maracaibo, in excess of its monthly allowable amount based
                            upon statistics beginning in January, 1939. (See Embassy Despatch No.

                            persons and firms not essential to the local economy and the present
                            licensing practice to those enterprises which may be considered
                            essential to local economy is hardly satisfactory in that there is no
                            effective control over these firms under existing Venezuelan Decrees,
                            nor is there the disposition to forcibly eliminate the undesirable

                            Department’s Instruction No. 1496 dated November 10, 1942, with which
                            was transmitted a study<note n="93" xml:id="d705fn93">Neither

                            Financial Control held in Washington June 30–July 10, 1942, prepared by
                            Mr. Covey T. Oliver.<note n="94" xml:id="d705fn94">At the time of

                            obtaining changes in Venezuelan law of the sort needed to bring it more
                            completely into harmony with the Conference Resolutions, reference is
                            made to Embassy Despatch No. 3690 dated December 28, 1942;<note n="95"
                                xml:id="d705fn95">Not printed.</note> since that time there has been
                            no legislation nor Executive decrees in this regard and the
                            administration of the Venezuelan Executive decrees of December 11 and
                            16, 1941, remains as unsatisfactory and ineffective as heretofore
                            reported. A brief review of some of the salient Cases in Venezuela, in
                            substantiation of the foregoing statements, is given below:</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Granting of Normal Credits and Banking
                                Facilities to Proclaimed List Nationals by Commercial
                            Banks:</hi></p>
                        <p>Letter from Mr. Groves to Superintendent of Banks dated March 16, 1943,
                            suggested that such banking facilities be terminated. (See Embassy
                            Despatch No. 4160 dated March 17, 1943.) This matter was promptly but
                                <hi rend="italic">unofficially</hi> brought to the attention of the
                            Banking Council by the Superintendent of Banks, because the Federal
                            Executive preferred not to give official recognition to any action taken
                            by the banks as a result of the communication. Refusal of official
                            cognizance to this situation, but fear of the consequences that might
                            attend inaction on their own part, led the banks to sign an agreement
                            between <pb n="839" xml:id="pg_839" facs="0853"/>themselves to terminate
                            all commercial banking relations with Proclaimed List Nationals. The
                            Federal Executive in an indirect way has recognized the banks’ action
                            directed against the Proclaimed List firms by authorizing the Banco
                            Central, the Banco Obrero and the Banco Agríeola y Pecuario—all
                            Governmental institutions—to become signatories to the agreement.</p>
                        <p>Although some of the banks have indicated that prior to the communication
                            from the Embassy, they had undertaken to reduce their commercial banking
                            transactions with Proclaimed List Nationals, the ever present sanctions
                            of curbing their banking relations with New York banks is undoubtedly
                            the controlling influence in what may be accomplished. Under the
                            agreement signed by all banks, their credit facilities to Proclaimed
                            List Nationals will be gradually reduced over a period of nine
                            months.</p>
                        <p>The banks reached an agreement in principle on this question over a month
                            ago, nevertheless the line credits extended to the Proclaimed List
                            Nationals have not yet been reduced one centime, the banks choosing to
                            await actual signing of the contract before beginning to act.</p>
                        <p>This matter of liberal granting of commercial credits to Proclaimed List
                            Nationals, when considered in the light of specially blocking of
                            accounts, more specifically explained on page 4 of Embassy Despatch No.
                            3690 of December 28, 1942, creates a rather curious situation; for,
                            although the Embassy is assured that funds paid into “a specially
                            blocked account” are absolutely immobilized insofar as the beneficiary
                            is concerned, the bank, of course, is permitted to use the funds as it
                            sees fit. And although those particular funds as such may not be
                            available to the Proclaimed List National, he is, in most instances,
                            permitted a liberal credit line by the bank without security. For
                            example, the Zinggs have blocked funds in the amount of Bs. 2,856,000
                            deposited in the following commercial banks of Venezuela: Banco de
                            Venezuela, Banco Mercantíl y Agríeola, Banco Caracas and Banco
                            Venezolano de Crédito and they enjoy an unsecured commercial credit line
                            from these several banks in the amount of approximately Bs.
                            2,000,000.</p>
                        <p>It is interesting to note that all blocking orders provide that funds are
                            blocked for six month periods, automatically extended until the
                            termination of the war <hi rend="italic">or until the Federal, Executive
                                expressly authorizes that said funds be devoted to some other

                            harbored by some that Proclaimed List firms will eventually be forced to
                            close, continue to lend them unsecured credits so that it is only
                            logical to conclude that these commercial banks would have some reason
                            to believe that in the event that a Proclaimed List National were unable
                            to meet his obligation to them, they could prevail upon the Federal
                            Executive to <pb n="840" xml:id="pg_840" facs="0854"/>permit an offset
                            of (blocked) credit and debit. To minimize this possibility, the Embassy
                            has insistently requested that specially blocked accounts be maintained
                            in the Banco Central de Venezuela, but has been unsuccessful in its
                            efforts because of the attitude assumed by the recently resigned
                            Minister of Hacienda (Finance),<note n="96" xml:id="d705fn96">Alfredo
                                Mactoado Hernandez.</note> notwithstanding the Central Bank’s
                            disposition to accept these deposits. The Minister insisted that,
                            although the Central Bank is legally permitted to accept deposits of
                            this nature, there is a gentlemen’s agreement between those favoring the
                            Central Bank and those in the commercial banking business who opposed
                            its organization, that it would not accept private deposits. It is not
                            meant to be implied that these commercial credits have been made
                            available since the creation of the specially blocked accounts, because
                            the more important firms in Venezuela which appear in the Proclaimed
                            List have long enjoyed excellent credit rating and commensurate banking
                            accommodation; but it cannot be overlooked that a continued granting of
                            these unsecured credits, despite the existence of restrictive
                            measures—at least on paper—may well be influenced by the fact that the
                            individuals concerned have on deposit with the banks sufficient funds to
                            meet these obligations in the event their normal ability to pay becomes
                            circumscribed.</p>
                        <p>In considering this subject it should be recalled that the Venezuelan
                            Ambassador to the United States requested the opinion of the Department
                            of State with regard to permitting the investment of Axis funds
                            (evidently meaning those funds paid into Specially Blocked Accounts) in
                            Venezuelan Treasury bills (See Embassy Despatch No. 4119 dated March 15,
                            1943) which would in effect permit the payment of interest on blocked
                            accounts at the rate of 4½% per annum, instead of 1¼% per annum, the
                            highest rate now paid on specially blocked accounts. To permit such an
                            investment would mean, in effect, that the only penalty suffered by
                            Proclaimed List firms on theoretically blocked funds would be the
                            difference between the return on Treasury bills (4½% per annum) and the
                            interest rate charged for commercial credits ranging from 4% to 9% per
                            annum, according to the firm’s credit rating (i.e. a possible profit of
                            ½% to annum). It is trusted that the Embassy’s present effort to have
                            commercial credits to Proclaimed List Nationals, completely terminated
                            within a period of nine months will bring forth an accurate statement
                            from the respective banks showing the extent to which these credits
                            exist and the rates of interest charged therefor.</p>

                            of PL Funds Frozen in Venezuelan Banks.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s Airgram No. 418 of March 4, 8:00 p.m., and the Embassy’s
                            reply by Confidential Despatch No. 4119 of March 15, 1943, both in
                            relation to the above subject.</p>
                        <p>In a conversation this week between Mr. Groves, of the Embassy Staff, and
                            Dr. Uslar Pietri, Minister of Hacienda, the latter brought up this
                            question and asked what Washington’s attitude might be. He pointed out
                            that the Venezuelan Government was anxious to absorb these especially
                            frozen funds of Proclaimed List firms now deposited with various local
                            commercial banks, on the ground that the volume of bank deposits in the
                            country would thereby be reduced with a proportionate reduction in the
                            inflationary influence inherent in increasing deposits. This is the same
                            argument referred to in the Embassy’s Despatch No. 4119 (page 2). Dr.
                            Uslar estimated the volume of such especially frozen sums at roughly Bs.
                            10,000,000, or say, $3,000,000.</p>
                        <p>In the discussion which followed, which indicates that the Venezuelan
                            authorities, of course, would freeze the interest payments on any such
                            investments, together with principle in case of repayment, Mr. Groves
                            told Dr. Uslar that—for his part—he felt his desire was not
                            unreasonable, since there would be some obvious advantage derived by the
                            Venezuelan Government while the Proclaimed List owner of the funds would
                            obtain an appreciable advantage only through the increase in earned
                            income presumably realizable after the War. Dr. Uslar was assured that
                            his inquiry would be transmitted to Washington for comment by the
                            appropriate authorities.</p>
                        <p>The only Venezuelan Government securities now available for such
                            investment are two issues of short term (six and nine months) 4½%
                            Treasury bills, which were put out some months ago in an aggregate
                            amount of about Bs. 9,000,000. Dr. Uslar stated that the further issue
                            of similar securities will be authorized by Congress for emission during
                            the current fiscal year. It is in these forthcoming issues that the
                            Government would like to place the frozen funds here in question.</p>
                        <p>While it seems quite probable that the Proclaimed List owners of the
                            frozen funds would welcome the investment of these funds in the
                            Government securities, as the Department suggests in its Airgram No. 418
                            mentioned above, nevertheless it is believed that the Government is
                            justified in its own expressed desire to see these funds more
                            effectively immobilized for the duration of the War.</p>

                        <p>The Embassy would appreciate the Department’s comment on this matter for
                            the benefit of the appropriate Venezuelan authorities.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that
                            immediately upon my return to Caracas the Foreign Minister called me to
                            the Chancellery to discuss the latest developments in the purchase of
                            the Caracas–Valencia, Railway.</p>
                        <p>He handed me a memorandum, copy and translation of which are
                                enclosed,<note n="97" xml:id="d707fn97">Not printed.</note> in which
                            is incorporated the report of the Venezuelan Minister at Madrid, which
                            states that the Spanish Government has given full guarantee that the
                            funds obtained from the sale of the Railway will be blocked in Spain
                            during the time fixed by the interested parties, and that these funds
                            may be invested in Spanish securities of the type which the Institute de
                            Moneda has established for cases of blocking.</p>
                        <p>The Minister informed me that this undertaking on the part of the Spanish
                            Government had been secured after a considerable amount of diplomatic
                            effort and it was hoped that the arrangement indicated would be
                            satisfactory to the American Government, so that the Venezuelan
                            Government might proceed immediately with its plan to make an outright
                            purchase and avoid complications that might arise out of its acquisition
                            by other means.</p>
                        <p>I then asked him what would be his attitude toward the undesirable
                            personnel, German nationals, who now operate the railroad and he assured
                            me that all such elements would be eliminated.</p>
                        <p>The Department has been fully informed by previous despatches, and by
                            recent conversations on the subject while the Ambassador was in the
                            Department of the Embassy’s opinion of the actual or potential danger of
                            leaving this strategic stretch of railroad under the control of enemy
                            nationals. It is hoped that the steps taken by the Venezuelan Government
                            to assure blocking of the funds in Spain will be acceptable to the
                            United States Government.</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate receiving the Department’s early reply to enable me to
                            inform Dr. Parra-Pérez promptly thereof.</p>

                            enclose three copies of a memorandum dated May 23 [<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>It will be noted from the Legal Attaché’s report of May 23, 1943 and from

                            28, 1943<note n="98" xml:id="d708fn100">Not printed.</note> that of the
                            30 aliens known to be employed by the railway 26 are nationals of
                            countries at war with the United States. The mere fact of the existence
                            of this nucleus of alien enemies in the railway’s personnel,
                            irrespective of the known individual pro-Nazi sentiments set forth

                            Government in taking all possible action to enable the Venezuelan
                            Government to gain title to the railway and eliminate this undesirable
                            personnel. In this connection reference is made particularly to my

                            Government’s desire to purchase the Caracas–Valencia railroad. President
                            Medina, this morning, personally expressed to me his anxiety over the
                            delay in the solution with regard to this railway and reiterated that
                            its purchase now would save the Government 25 to 30 million bolivars and
                            that the funds in payment would be blocked in Spain.</p>
                        <p>Please instruct me urgently by cable, so that I can inform the President
                            before he departs on July 17, for a 3 weeks’ visit to Bolivarian
                            countries.</p>

                        <p>486. Your despatch 4536, June 19, and 4545, June 24, and your telegram
                            618, July 12. The Department has just informed the Venezuelan Embassy
                            that it cannot approve the use of United States facilities to transmit
                            funds to Spain in connection with purchase of German Railroad.
                            Resolution 6, paragraph 4, adopted at the Washington Conference
                            contemplates that enemy assets shall be blocked in banks under the
                            jurisdiction of the respective governments of the Western Hemisphere,
                            and the Department does not feel that Venezuela can appropriately
                            delegate its responsibility for blocking enemy assets to a European
                            neutral.</p>
                        <p>For your information, the Department is unwilling to create a precedent
                            of blocking in European neutral countries; Treasury has indicated that
                            it will not license the remittance; so substantial an increase in
                            Spanish dollar holdings in this country is regarded as disadvantageous
                            to our preclusive purchasing program since the Spanish are presently
                            evincing reluctance to accept dollars in exchange for wolfram and other
                            commodities purchased in Spain, and it is becoming increasingly
                            difficult to secure pesetas.<note n="99" xml:id="d710fn99">For

                        <p>Embassy’s view with reference to security problem has been carefully
                            considered. However, the Department feels that the balance of economic
                            warfare advantage lies with rejecting the Venezuelan proposal. Despatch

                        <p>You may indicate to President Medina that the Department is attempting to
                            work out an alternative proposal to make to the Venezuelan Government
                            with reference to the transfer of the Railroad that will avoid
                            difficulties with respect to any bona fide pre-war Spanish interests in
                            the Spanish holding company.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s Circular Instruction of July 1, 1943,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d711fn1">Not printed.</note> on the subject of elimination
                            of enemy influence <pb n="845" xml:id="pg_845" facs="0859"/>from
                            insurance, requesting the Mission’s careful consideration of the
                            proposals set out therein and its views thereon.</p>
                        <p>Although the Embassy endorses the proposals listed in the Instruction
                            under reference, a hurried and superficial survey of the insurance
                            situation in Venezuela reveals that few of the objections pointed to by
                            these proposals exist in Venezuela. It is recalled that the most
                            offensive condition in the insurance field with regard to our Economic
                            Warfare Program was recently settled satisfactorily when Cia. Nacional
                            Anonima de Seguros “La Previsora”, that reinsured with British
                            Companies, cancelled all existing fire insurance policies with
                            Proclaimed List Nationals (See Embassy Despatch No. 4580 dated July 7,
                                1943).<note n="2" xml:id="d711fn2">Despatch not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>The concrete proposals submitted in the Instruction under reference are
                            considered in their respective order, to wit:</p>
                                <p>1: The survey made indicates that in Venezuela there are no
                                    insurance and reinsurance transactions with companies which
                                    operate directly from enemy territory or with companies in enemy
                                    territory which operate through agencies in this
                                    hemisphere.</p>
                                <p>2: There are no persons or firms in the insurance business in
                                    Venezuela who are included in the Proclaimed List of Certain
                                    Blocked Nationals.</p>
                                <p>3: From the brief survey made, it would appear that the problem
                                    with neutral European companies does not present itself in
                                    Venezuela.</p>
                                <p>4: This proposal will most nearly meet the problem in the
                                        insurance field which presents itself in Venezuela, and the
                                        obtaining of undertakings from non-listed companies by which
                                        they will agree not to insure any persons on the Proclaimed
                                        List or any property in which such persons have an interest
                                        is particularly endorsed, and it might be suggested that the
                                        form of Undertaking include the provision to cancel all such
                                        existing insurance as soon as possible.</p>
                                    <p>In the dealings recently consummated and reported in Embassy
                                        Despatch No. 4580 dated July 7, 1943, by which Cia. Nacional
                                        Anonima de Seguros “La Previsora” cancelled existing fire
                                        insurance policies with Proclaimed List Nationals, it was
                                        learned that by this Company’s Policy No. 12926 it had
                                        insured a building in Caracas belonging to “Hauck” S.A. (PL)
                                        for the amount of Bs. 200,000., the policy designating the
                                        Banco Venezolano de Crédito as beneficiary in view of the
                                        fact that “Hauck” S.A. (PL) had mortgaged the building to
                                        this Bank to secure a loan in the amount of the policy. A
                                        similar problem presented itself in the case of the Policy
                                        No. 11462 by which a building in Valencia belonging to
                                        Giugni y Cia. Sucrs (PL) was insured for Bs. 150,000. which
                                        policy names the Banco Industrial de Venezuela as
                                        beneficiary, this building having been mortgaged to the Bank
                                        to secure a loan in the amount of the policy. The Embassy is
                                        now giving these problems its study because, although the
                                        beneficiary in the policy is not a Proclaimed List National,
                                        nevertheless in the event of loss, a Proclaimed List
                                        National will benefit indirectly.</p>
                                    <p>Another problem now receiving the Embassy’s study, which
                                        falls <pb n="846" xml:id="pg_846" facs="0860"/>in this
                                        category, is the matter of trucking companies obtaining
                                        floating insurance policies from local insurance companies
                                        for goods shipped from point to point within the Republic,
                                        particularly goods moving between Caracas and Maracaibo,
                                        Venezuela, because, in many instances, the truckers move
                                        goods belonging to Proclaimed List Nationals which are
                                        covered by these policies and it is difficult for the
                                        insurer to have knowledge thereof.</p>
                                <p>5: It would not appear that this proposal is applicable to the
                                    insurance situation existing in Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>It is not anticipated that any additional personnel may be needed to
                            carry out these proposals in Venezuela.</p>

                            19, 1943, with regard to the investment of blocked accounts in Venezuela

                            noted from the memorandum of conversation that various questions were
                            raised with Sr. Lares as to the nature of the proposed transaction. It
                            was pointed out to Sr. Lares that the Department would be able to
                            express a more useful opinion on the matter if it knew the purposes the
                            Venezuelan Government had in mind in wishing to effect a conversion of
                            blocked accounts into government bonds, and the exact nature of the
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Venezuelan Embassy has not approached the Department again with
                            reference to this proposal. However, since officials of the Venezuelan
                            Government have brought the matter to the attention of officers of the
                            Embassy in Caracas, it is believed that it may be appropriately pointed
                            out that the Treasury Department practice here permits the investment of
                            blocked accounts in Government securities. For the Embassy’s
                            information, it also permits investment in private securities listed on
                            the national stock exchanges.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that Venezuelan controls are by no means as adequate
                            as those adopted in this country, the Department does not feel that the
                            cases are parallel. However, in view of the Treasury practice noted
                            above, there seems to be no basis on which this Government can object to
                            the proposal, provided that the principal and any interest accruing
                            thereon will remain effectively blocked for the duration of the war.</p>

                        <p>In as much as there would seem to be a definite advantage to the owners
                            of specially blocked accounts in investing these accounts in government
                            securities which carry a higher rate of interest, it is suggested that
                            comment be withheld until the Venezuelan Government renews its inquiry,
                            if in the Embassy’s judgment, this is possible.</p>

                                        of invoices and business record books and announced to them
                                        that they would be included in the cited “black lists” in

                                        specific German and Italian firms. Intervention was carried
                                        to the extreme point of requesting the suppression of
                                        commercial advertising signs which some of the
                                        establishments visited were exhibiting.</item>

                        <p>As stated in my telegram under reference, this whole matter has been
                            given personal study and investigation and I have come to the following
                            conclusions both as to the facts of the case and the underground
                            political pressure that gave rise to the formal protest received.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, Mr. Freeman of the Embassy undertook this publicity
                                <pb n="848" xml:id="pg_848" facs="0862"/>trip with the full
                            knowledge and consent of the Counselor of Embassy for Economic Affairs,
                            although the Chancery of the Embassy was not advised thereof nor
                            consulted as to the political desirability of such direct investigation.
                            From prior information regarding conditions in the Andean States and
                            from the results of the investigations made and the publicity given to
                            the Proclaimed List in consequence of this trip, however, it is not too
                            much to say that the prosecution of Economic Warfare in these outlying
                            regions, which have remained the stronghold of German and Italian
                            influence, has become a reality to the commercial interests located
                            there which, up to now, had been largely ignorant or scornful of our
                            efforts in this highly important line of war activity.</p>
                        <p>From the reports of Mr. Freeman, which I have gone over carefully, and
                            from conversations with him in the light of the Venezuelan protest, it
                            does not appear that he went beyond the scope of his instructions. His
                            visit was one of explanation and clarification to those friendly firms
                            that, through unawareness of the scope and implications of the
                            Proclaimed List, had placed themselves under suspicion: it gave
                            publicity to the List and brought to our numerous enemies working in the
                            Andean region a clear-cut knowledge that their actions were neither
                            unknown nor overlooked.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Freeman carried out his duties with considerable zeal. He sought
                            cooperation and received it fully in the vast majority of instances. He
                            states that at no time did he require merchants to show their books or
                            invoices and always sought to refuse offers to show them. The
                            “suppression of commercial advertising signs”, referred to by the
                            Foreign Office, arose from the logical statement to merchants who denied
                            dealing in black list products that a “Bayer” sign outside their stores
                            gave other implication. The only signs removed or painted out were Bayer
                            signs.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the alleged “false prerogatives”, Mr. Freeman is an
                            employee of the Embassy staff and was traveling under authority of the
                            Counselor for Economic Affairs on Embassy business and made it publicly
                            known that this was the case. I am convinced that Arne Andersen is an
                            innocent victim of his association with Freeman. It does not appear that
                            he ever claimed any connection with this Embassy or the United States
                            Government on his own behalf. True, he traveled with Freeman in a car
                            having diplomatic license plates, but his reasons for the trip were of a
                            private business nature and to accompany a friend. We owe him whatever
                            informal support that can he properly given.</p>
                        <p>As the matter now stands a decree of expulsion has been promulgated
                            against Andersen and the Foreign Office has informally indicated that it
                            would be well to transfer Freeman to another post.</p>
                        <pb n="849" xml:id="pg_849" facs="0863"/>
                        <p>I have so far answered the Foreign Office memorandum with a statement
                            that I am making a personal investigation of the case. I fear that the
                            expulsion decree against Andersen will stand since it has already been
                            published in the <hi rend="italic">Official Gazette</hi>. I understand
                            that the Danish Legation in Washington is being informed and that they
                            may request our good offices in the matter. I should be glad to take up
                            his case if instructed to do so by the Department.<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d713fn7">The expulsion decree appears to have remained in
                                force, and on November 18, 1943, Ambassador Escalante advised that

                                Andersen was blameless. Freeman was assigned to the Embassy in

                            American Ambassador at Madrid directed to the Department as a
                            preliminary reply to its request for information concerning the
                            German-controlled Spanish holding company that owns the Gran Ferrocarril

                                <p>In about 1924 the firm was registered in Spain with a capital of
                                    21,000,000 pesetas, and ownership of shares is difficult to
                                    trace since they are to bearer. The firm’s general manager is
                                    still absent, and that individual is apparently the only one
                                    with any knowledge of the shares’ ownership. Ignorance of the
                                    bona fide Spanish ownership is professed by the vice-president,
                                    but he estimates that about onethird of the shares are owned by
                                    Germans.</p>

                                    incorporation in Spain is probably a device to avoid taxation or
                                    other disadvantages, that Spanish interest is very small, and
                                    that Spanish officers named are dummies. I pointed out that
                                    under these circumstances Spain was in effect demanding that
                                    funds be sent to Spain by Venezuela to reimburse non-Spanish
                                    nationals, if it is insisted by Spain that the purchase price be
                                    transferred and control be exercised over its disposition. It
                                    was stated by Huete that the protection of bona fide Spanish
                                    interests is the only interest of Spain.</p>

                                        operated the business from Berlin; the railroad, nominally
                                        owned by Ferrocarriles Sudamericanos of Madrid, was
                                        understood to have been actually controlled by Disconte

                                    were to be blocked in the United States or in Venezuela, I do
                                    not believe stockholders would agree to the sale of property, in
                                    view of the hidden interests. I do not believe, on the other
                                    hand, that the Spanish Government would be seriously perturbed
                                    if the property were expropriated by the Venezuelan Government
                                    and it were agreed by that government to pay a fair price which,
                                    after Spanish ownership has been revoked, would be distributed
                                    to bona fide stockholders. Probably for the duration of the war
                                    the determination of such ownership could be delayed. It would
                                    probably be insisted by the Spanish Government that payment be
                                    effected to Spanish shareholders at the time purchase is
                                    effected, and that government would be reluctant to certify
                                    concerning ownership on September 1, 1939.”</p>

                            considerations leading it to the conclusion that the balance of economic
                            warfare advantage lay with rejecting the Venezuelan proposal to purchase
                            this railroad for funds to be blocked in Spain, the subject railway
                            company has repeatedly been the topic of discussion between Mr. Groves,
                            Counselor of Embassy for Economic Affairs, and Dr. Arturo Uslar Pietri,
                            Minister of Finance. In August, 1943, Dr. Uslar expressed the personal
                            opinion that the railroad should be included in the Proclaimed List of
                            Certain Blocked Nationals as a step to facilitate action by the
                            Venezuelan Government in forcibly taking over and nationalizing the
                            road. However, at that time he proposed to discuss the matter with
                            President Medina in order to ascertain the latter’s view thereon. In
                            early October, 1943, Dr. Uslar was reminded of this matter and expressed
                            regret that a decision had not yet been reached and explained that he
                            had discussed the matter in detail with the President but since final
                            decision involved the Foreign Minister as well as the President, the
                            return of the Foreign Minister, who was temporarily out of the city,
                            must be awaited before final determination of the matter. Dr. Uslar then
                            stated that he would inform Mr. Groves of the decision reached within a
                            few days.</p>
                        <p>On October 11, 1943, Mr. Groves called on Dr. Uslar at the latter’s
                            request and the Minister, after recalling conversations relative to the
                            Railway Company, stated that the road was operating under increasingly
                            difficult conditions and would have to close entirely, perhaps by the
                            end of the year, if necessary supplies were not forthcoming. He also
                            referred to the legal technicality that the road is ostensibly a Spanish
                            corporation, although he did not know exactly what interest therein is
                            actually Spanish. He then requested that the Company be included in the
                            Proclaimed List as soon as this could be accomplished, and, if possible,
                            that the Venezuelan Government be given advance notice thereof to permit
                            it to act simultaneously to take over the railroad and prevent possible
                            sabotage. This request was transmitted to the Department by the
                            Embassy’s Telegram No. 927 of October 11, 1943, 3: P.M.<note n="14"

                            23, 1943, had been approved by the Interdepartmental Committee and
                            authorized that the Venezuelan Authorities be so informed. In compliance
                            with this authorization, the Minister of Finance was advised of this
                            action by informal note dated October 16, 1943.<note n="15"

                            October 7, 1943, from the Embassy at Madrid, quoted in the Department’s
                            telegram No. 770 dated October 15, 1943,<note n="15a" xml:id="d715fn16a"
                                >Not printed.</note> the Embassy inquired of Dr. Uslar whether there
                            had been any development that might cause the Venezuelan Government to
                            desire a change in the plan to announce the listing of the railroad on
                            October 23, (but he was not given the suggestions from Madrid conveyed
                            in telegram No. 770 regarding possibilities of direct purchase.) Dr.
                            Uslar replied that he foresaw no reason to modify the plan but stated
                            that he would confer with President Medina on Wednesday evening (October
                            20) and would inform the Embassy early Thursday morning whether any
                            change was desired.</p>
                        <p>On Wednesday evening, October 20, 1943, Dr. Uslar telephoned Mr. Groves
                            to say that he had discussed the matter with the President and if it was
                            still possible, and not too disturbing, they would like to have the
                            publication date postponed four or five days, explaining that there was
                            a difference of opinion among the Venezuelan Government lawyers on
                            certain legal points which they would like to clear up in the meantime.
                            Mr. Groves stated that he would telephone Washington for a decision
                            early on Thursday morning, (October 21) and expected to have an answer
                            for the Minister by noon. A telephone call to Mr. Francis H. Russell,
                            Chief of Division, World Trade Intelligence, Washington, was completed
                            at 11:30 A.M., October 21, when Mr. Russell advised that the time was
                            now too short to cancel arrangements for publication on Saturday,
                            October 23, and this was communicated to Dr. Uslar by telephone
                            immediately. Dr. Uslar did not seem surprised at the information and,
                            after expressing appreciation, stated that he would advise the President
                            of this fact early in the afternoon, and would telephone again later in
                            the afternoon if there were any further developments.</p>
                        <p>On Thursday evening, October 21, Dr. Uslar again telephoned Mr. Groves to
                            say that it was of great importance to the Venzuelan Government to have
                            the publication of the German Railroad listing deferred, if at all
                            possible, for several days. He was reminded of the negative answer on
                            this point received in the telephone conversation with Mr. Russell
                            earlier in the day, but Mr. Groves offered to make one further last
                            minute effort in another telephone call to Washington the next day. The
                            morning of October 22, 1943, Mr. Groves again talked with Mr. Russell by
                            telephone and explained Dr. Uslar’s urgent request. Mr. Russell stated
                            with more emphasis that it was then impossible to stop publication on
                            October 23. This answer was communicated at once by telephone to Dr.
                            Uslar who again indicated no surprise and expressed thanks for the
                            effort.</p>

                        <p>On Saturday, October 23, the three Ministries concerned, by Resolution
                            published in the <hi rend="italic">Gaceta Oficial</hi>, No. 21.237,
                            subjected the railroad to the provisions of article 4 of the Executive
                            Decree of December 11, 1941, and to paragraph <hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                            of article 3 of the Decree of December 16, 1941, which in effect blocked
                            bank accounts of the railroad and placed it under the Venezuelan
                            interventor system. A copy of this Resolution with translation is
                            transmitted herewith.<note n="16" xml:id="d715fn17">Not printed.</note>
                            (It is understood that the railroad now has on deposit in Venezuelan
                            Banks approximately Bs. 440,000.)</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>On October 26 Mr. Groves called on Dr. Uslar by appointment to ascertain
                            what steps the Venezuelan Government proposed to take looking to the
                            nationalization of the railroad and the elimination of the undesirable
                            elements now connected with it. Dr. Uslar explained that although there
                            were several legal possibilities for attaining the objective, the
                            President of the Republic had decided the procedure should be that the
                            oil companies should not furnish any additional fuel to the railroad for
                            the present; its present supply would be exhausted in about two weeks,
                            at which time it would be obliged to cease operations, and under its
                            franchise would then forfeit all rights and could be taken over by the
                            Government. The oil companies were immediately advised—at the request of
                            Dr. Uslar—that they would not be licensed to furnish petroleum products
                            to the Gran Ferrocarril de Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy now awaits developments under this procedure and is presently
                            making a thorough study of all personnel connected with the railway, so
                            that when the occasion presents itself, it will be in a position to
                            inform the Venezuelan Government as to which of those persons connected
                            with the railway company are considered undesirable.</p>
                        <p>The Department will be kept informed of further developments.</p>
