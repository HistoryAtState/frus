                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
                    and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. These regulations, with
                    minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102–138, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> Authorization
                    Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, which was signed by President <persName>George
                        Bush</persName> on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new
                    Title IV to the Department of State's Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC
                    4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government,
                    including facts that contributed to the formulation of policies and records that
                    provided supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of
                    concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30
                    years after the events recorded.</p>

                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the

                    the 1964–1968 subseries of 34 volumes, the editors chose to present the official
                    record of U.S. foreign policy with respect to Europe, the Soviet Union, and
                    Canada in six volumes. <ref target="frus1964-68v17">Volume XVII</ref>, Eastern

                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, reviews records, advises,

                    compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all aspects of
                    the preparation and declassification of the series. Although the Advisory
                    Committee does not attempt to review the contents of individual volumes in the
                    series, it does monitor the overall process and makes recommendations on

                <p>The declassification review of this volume in 1995 resulted in the decision to
                    withhold less than one-half of one percent of the documentation originally
                    selected. The absence of the withheld information does not compromise the
                    accuracy of the account of the main lines of U.S. policy toward Eastern Europe
                    during the 1964–1968 period presented here.</p>

                    Department of State, conducted the declassification review of the documents
                    published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with the

                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,

                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments.</p>

                        Series</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    the editors are guided by some general principles for the selection of
                    documents. Each editor, in consultation with the General Editor and other senior
                    editors, determines the particular issues and topics to be documented either in
                    detail, in brief, or in summary. Some general decisions are also made regarding
                    issues that cannot be documented in the volume but will be addressed in
                    bibliographical notes.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the
                    Foreign Relations series. Individual compiler-editors vary these criteria in
                    accordance with the particular issues and the available documentation. The
                    compiler-editors also tend to apply these selection criteria in accordance with
                    their own interpretation of the generally accepted standards of scholarship. In
                    selecting documentation for publication, the editors give priority to
                    unpublished classified records, rather than previously published records (which
                    are accounted for in appropriate bibliographical notes).</p>

                <p>The documentation in this volume highlights U.S. policy toward Eastern Europe,
                    particularly the U.S. response to the crisis created by the August 1968 Soviet
                    invasion of Czechoslovakia. Prior to the invasion, U.S. policy in the region had
                    been characterized by an ongoing effort to loosen ties between the Soviet Union
                    and its Communist satellites through the use of limited economic assistance.
                    This policy of “Bridge Building” to Eastern Europe through selective use of U.S.
                    economic power was only partially successful. President <persName
                        corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> faced serious opposition from within
                    Congress to this initiative. In addition, Eastern European Communist regimes,
                    while eager to obtain U.S. aid, wanted few conditions attached to its
                    utilization and aimed to use outside assist-ance to consolidate their political
                    control. The rise of a Communist reform movement in Czechoslovakia, while
                    welcomed by the United States, offered U.S. diplomacy little practical
                    assistance in carrying out this policy. The Communist reformers were
                    fundamentally hostile to the United States. As a result the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> administration was an interested observer as
                    the Czech and Soviet states confronted each other. After the Soviet invasion of
                    August 1968, the United States feared further Soviet military moves and actively
                    sought to provide support to bolster the independence of Austria, Yugoslavia,
                    Romania, and Finland.</p>

                <p>Responsibility for policy formulation and advice to the President on these issues
                    was shared between the National Security Council and the Department of State. In
                    addition to papers from President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                    >Johnson</persName>'s White House, documents were selected from among the
                    records of these agencies, together with intelligence estimates prepared by the
                    Central Intelligence Agency and interdepartmental planning group papers, in
                    order to provide broad coverage of basic political and economic policy
                    formulation in Washington. Embassy reporting was also included to provide the
                    context of the policy debate in Washington and document major interchanges with
                    foreign leaders.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The documents are presented in chapters, arranged chronologically according to
                    Washington time or, in the case of conferences, in the order of individual
                    meetings. Incoming telegrams from U.S. Missions are placed according to time of
                    receipt in the Department of State or other receiving agency, rather than the
                    time of transmission; memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time
                    and date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was
                    drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors
                    for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
                    each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for security reasons have been
                    accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of pages not
                    declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material omitted from
                    this volume because it was unrelated <pb n="XIV" xml:id="pg_XIV" facs="0014"/>to
                    the subject of the volume, however, has not been delineated. Brackets that
                    appear in the source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This footnote also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates if the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been
                    made to determine if a document has been previously published, and this
                    information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts have been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major foreign policy
                    decisions and actions of the U.S. Government. It further requires that
                    government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    cooperate with the Department of State Historian by providing full and complete
                    access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by
                    providing copies of selected records. The editors believe that in terms of
                    access this volume was prepared in accordance with the standards and mandates of
                    this statute, although access to some records was restricted, as noted
                    below.</p>
                <p>The editors have complete access to all the records and papers of the Department
                    of State they deem necessary: the central files of the Department; the special
                    decentralized files (“lot files”) of the Department at the bureau, office, and
                    division levels; the files of the Department's Executive Secretariat, which
                    contain the records of international conferences and high-level official visits,
                    correspondence with foreign leaders by the President and Secretary of State, and
                    memoranda of conversations between the President and Secretary of State and
                    foreign officials; certain intelligence-related files maintained in the Bureau
                    of Intelligence and Research; and the files of overseas diplomatic posts.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full
                    access to the papers of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                    and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential papers and the
                    collections of principal officials of the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                        >Johnson</persName> administration maintained and preserved at the <persName

                    much of the most significant foreign affairs-related documentation from other
                    federal agencies including the National Security Council, the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
                    All of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of these
                    agencies, the support of the National Archives and Records Administration, and
                    the special close cooperation of the staff of the Johnson Library.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have access to records of the Department of
                    Defense, particularly the records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
                    Secretaries of Defense and their major assistants.</p>
                <p>Thanks to the cooperation of Johnson Library Director Harry J. Middleton and the
                    Library staff, Department of State historians were given access to the
                    collection of audiotapes of more than 7,000 telephone conversations of President
                        <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. The collection is far too
                    large for the Department historians to review in detail and also maintain the
                    accelerated <pb n="XVI" xml:id="pg_XVI" facs="0016"/>schedule for the
                    preparation of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes for the
                        <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> Presidency. Working with the
                    Library staff, Department historians developed a plan for the selective review
                    of those conversations that occurred during major foreign policy crises and
                    negotiations. The first audiotapes became available to the editors in late 1994,
                    after this volume had been compiled. The editors decided not to delay
                    publication of this volume since very few telephone conversations concerned
                    Eastern Europe, but if relevant records are found among the conversations, they
                    may be included in a later <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume. The
                    Johnson Library also gave Department historians access to its collection of
                    audiotapes of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s
                    meetings in the Cabinet Room during 1968. Records of three important meetings
                    concerning Czechoslovakia during 1968 have been included in this volume.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians' access to intelligence records still in the
                    custody of the Central Intelligence Agency is arranged by the History Staff of
                    the Center for the Study of Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency.

                    1991. This volume, which was compiled in 1992 and 1993, includes four documents
                    from the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> records and one <gloss

                                system. The new system was divided into broad categories:
                                Administration, Consular, Culture and Information, Economic,
                                Political and Defense, Science, and Social. Within each of these
                                divisions were subcategories. For example, Political and Defense
                                contained four subtopics: POL (politics), DEF (defense), CSM
                                (Communism), and INT (intelligence). Numerical subdivisions further

                        </list>
                        <p>In reply to my question as to what was going on in Eastern Europe,
                                <persName corresp="#p_VV1">Velebit</persName> said that of course
                            his contacts were only on the economic side, and then proceeded to
                            discuss the political side as well.</p>
                        <p>He started with Czechoslovakia, and said they were not doing well, their
                            economy was stagnant, and there was a disposition to change their
                            system. I asked, “Moving more to the Yugoslav example?” He replied, “I
                            hope they do better than that.” He said that the Czechoslovakians had
                            shown more independence vis-á-vis the Soviets. They had openly opposed
                            the Soviet position on the importance to be accorded East-West trade
                            problems at the UN Conference on Trade and Development. Also, they had
                            praised the <gloss target="#t_ECE1">ECE</gloss> Secretariat's “Economic
                            Survey of Europe” despite its unfavorable report on the Czech economy
                            and the traditionally critical attitude of the Bloc toward such
                            surveys.</p>
                        <p>He said the Hungarians were much bolder than they had been, and even more
                            so than the Poles. The Poles were being held back by <persName
                                corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>, who was “stupid and stubborn”
                            and was putting the brakes on. When I asked him in what areas the
                            Hungarians were bolder, he said both political and economic. The trend
                            was towards close relations with Yugoslavia and acceptance of their
                            ideas. He went into some detail in explaining Rumania's desire for
                            independence of Soviet <gloss target="#t_COMECON1">COMECON</gloss>
                            planning. The Rumanians were demanding independence in their economic
                            development. He saw no progress in Bulgaria.</p>
                        <p>He said the situation in East Germany was “hopeless”. When I commented
                            that the East German government was the most unpopular in the world, he
                            said he wasn't sure that he could accept that and mentioned <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="pg_2" facs="0030"/>South Viet-Nam. I said to avoid argument
                            I will change it to the most unpopular communist government. He replied,
                            “undoubtedly.” He said that 90-odd percent of the people were opposed to
                            Ulbricht.</p>
                        <p>He agreed that the undoubted objective of all Eastern European countries
                            would be Tito's independent status. When I asked him what we could do to
                            encourage this, he said we must be patient, it would be slow, but “don't
                            put in any obstacles.” He suggested we help to expand trade, of course
                            on a “most-favored-nation” basis. He reiterated his conviction that
                            improved trade improves the political climate. He said he regretted the
                            comment that was made when the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            report on the USSR was made public,<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2">Reference

                            in difficulties, we should put every obstacle in the way of her
                            development. He said that sort of statement was counterproductive. I
                            told him I hadn't seen the statement, but it evidently came from some
                            news columns or commentaries. I agreed with his conclusion as far as the
                            Soviet Union was concerned, but said that I felt that the regime of
                            Peiping was so aggressive and in such difficulties it would be a mistake
                            for us to change our attitude. As he was just leaving, he didn't comment
                            on this.</p>

                        <p>A new and less rigid relationship is developing between Eastern Europe
                            and Moscow. This has resulted partly from changes in Soviet policy but,
                            more importantly, from a recognition by the lesser Communist regimes
                            themselves that they now are in a position to insist on greater
                            consideration for individual national interests. Although this discovery
                            is having an ever-increasing influence on their attitudes, the <pb n="3"

                            in remaining a part of some sort of bloc of Communist states. Moscow
                            nevertheless can expect to encounter increasing difficulties in leading
                            that bloc.</p>

                        <p>The recent trip to Peiping of a high-level Rumanian party delegation<note

                            highlights the changes which have been developing in Moscow's relations
                            with Eastern Europe. It seems clear that the Russians, lacking unanimous
                            support even in Eastern Europe for their projected harder tactics in the
                            Sino-Soviet dispute, had no acceptable alternative but to acquiesce in
                            the Rumanian desire to play the role of mediator in talks with the
                            Chinese Communists. Certainly Moscow's propaganda coverage after the
                            Rumanian delegation returned empty-handed was warmer and more friendly
                            than that given on its departure for Peiping.</p>
                        <p>In the post-Stalin era, policies pursued by the Soviet bloc had until
                            last July increasingly reflected a consensus of the member states.
                            Multilateral consultations on policy matters, with the views of all
                            being heard, had with reasonable success replaced Stalinist
                            bilateralism. At times, of course, such consultations became acrimonious
                            as a single participant, strongly motivated by self-interest, held out
                            for more consideration of his position. But in the long run the will of
                            the Soviet Union usually prevailed. This technique of controlled
                            multilateral policy-making suffered a severe blow last summer, however,
                            when the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (<gloss
                                target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss>) finally yielded to Rumania's
                            opposition and abandoned, at least for the time being, certain aspects
                            of Soviet bloc planning and integration sponsored by the USSR.</p>
                        <p>The subsequent trend toward even slacker control promises increasing
                            difficulties for Moscow in its relations with the Eastern European
                            countries, particularly because it no longer has as extensive a network
                            of informers and advisers throughout their government and party
                            structures. In Poland, for example, Soviet advisers and intelligence
                            specialists since 1958 have been restricted to formal contacts with
                            their counterparts under a written agreement and are no longer
                            integrated into party and government offices. Similar arrangements are
                            believed to govern Moscow's present relations with the other Eastern
                            European States.</p>
                        <p>Also contributing to the USSR's difficulties has been the disappearance,
                            except in the broadest sense, of clearly defined limits set by Moscow of
                            what constitutes acceptable behavior by a Soviet bloc member. A Polish
                            Foreign Ministry official recently commented to a Western official that,
                            even though neither the East German regime nor the USSR liked the idea
                            of the Rumanian delegation going to Peiping, the Rumanians had <pb n="4"
                                xml:id="pg_4" facs="0032"/>the right to take an individual

                            accepting Yugoslavia as a Communist country practicing a correct form of
                            socialism. This probably carried an implication for some of the Eastern
                            Europeans that the limited autonomy they had heretofore exercised only
                            in internal affairs had been extended to matters having bloc-wide
                            significance. The effect is visible even in such conservative regimes as
                            that in Czechoslovakia. Influential Czechoslovak party dissidents
                            recently published an article strongly praising the basic features of
                            Yugoslavia's unique brand of socialism and implying that these should be
                            adopted in their country.<note n="5" xml:id="d2fn5">During the winter of

                            liberal methods of economic management, including decentralization and
                            improved incentives.</p>
                        <p>The Eastern European leaderships, recognizing that <persName

                            and backing in the dispute with Communist China, have been further
                            emboldened in their efforts to establish a semi-independent relationship
                            with Moscow. Since last fall several other Eastern European countries—in
                            addition to Rumania—are believed to have vigorously opposed Russia's
                            intention of bringing the Sino-Soviet dispute to a showdown. East
                            Germany, on the other hand, is reported to be dissatisfied with Moscow's
                            failure to take a firm line with Peiping.</p>

                        <p>An even more difficult problem for the Russians, growing out of the
                            developing autonomous relations, has been public conflict between
                            individual Eastern European countries over policy questions. This type
                            of behavior, which has rarely been observed before, reflects the decline
                            of Moscow's influence and is likely to become more frequent. Recently
                            the East German party published a politburo report on problems it faced
                            because of Czechoslovakia's de-Stalinization program.<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d2fn8">The report of Horst Sindermann was published in <hi
                                    rend="italic">Neues Deutschland</hi>, February 13, 1964.</note>
                            This same report also attacked, although not by name, those brotherly
                            countries—Poland, Rumania, and Hungary—that had signed economic
                            agreements with Bonn. The East Germans were concerned because these
                            three countries had recognized for trade purposes that West Berlin was a
                            part of West Germany, a position contrary to that long propagandized by
                            the <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> regime and the USSR
                            itself. By implication the East Germans criticized the USSR for
                            permitting these developments and suggested that Bulgaria and
                            Czechoslovakia should not sign such agreements. Bulgaria, nevertheless,
                            did so three weeks later, and apparently with Russian approval.</p>
                        <p>The Eastern European countries will almost certainly attempt to broaden
                            their autonomy even more in view of the unsatisfied demands of
                            self-interest in all of them. Also they have seen the success of other
                            Communist regimes such as Yugoslavia, Albania, and Communist China in
                            taking wholly independent courses of action.</p>
                        <p>There are, to be sure, some built-in brakes on this pursuit of an
                            independent course. No Eastern European Communist leader wants to risk
                            his personal position through any weakening of the power structure in
                            his own party, a distinct threat in Czechoslovakia and Poland and to a
                            lesser degree so far in East Germany and Bulgaria. He may see Soviet
                            support as the only thing standing between him and Albania. Furthermore,
                            there are still advantages to be drawn from a generally common ideology
                            and from participation in the Warsaw Pact and <gloss target="#t_CEMA1"

                        <p>In the present fluid situation, Moscow is highly reluctant to try to
                            insure conformity through coercive measures, such as political or
                            economic sanctions, lest existing differences sharpen or more resistance
                            be generated. Indeed, as a Yugoslav foreign affairs official recently
                                <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0034"/>remarked while commenting on
                            the possibility of an international Communist meeting to condemn the
                            Chinese, meetings such as those held in 1957 and 1960 could never again
                            take place. The time is past, he said, when such meetings could be
                            called at Moscow's behest. In his opinion, Rumania would decline to
                            attend unless it has a clearly defined agenda in advance, and Poland,
                            Czechoslovakia, and Hungary would probably adopt a similar attitude.</p>
                        <p>The development of a more persuasive approach on Moscow's part may
                            therefore be adumbrated in its recently announced $300-million loan to
                            Bulgaria for industrial development and its signing of bilateral
                            agreements with Bulgaria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia for long-term
                            scientific, technical, and economic planning assistance and for greater
                            economic coordination. Of all previous Russian loans to Bulgaria,
                            totaling about $400 million, approximately half was earmarked for
                            agricultural development. The new loan may thus be designed in part to
                            forestall demands and recriminations by Sofia and another disagreement
                            like that with Rumania.</p>
                        <p>In another indication of Soviet fence-mending, a high official in
                            Bucharest has just recently let it be known that the USSR will supply
                            significant amounts of equipment, as originally promised in 1960, for
                            the Galati complex as well as increased supplies of iron ore, a decision
                            which, according to another source, may have been taken in early
                            January.</p>

                            the Soviet bloc's intramural ties and its relations with the West are
                            not without effect on the individual parties, where current trends are
                            in dispute. Factionalism in Czechoslovakia and Poland has become
                            intense, is evident in Bulgaria, and has appeared even in East

                        <p>Czechoslovakia's <persName corresp="#p_NA1">Novotny</persName> has been
                            forced by liberal elements in his party to remove close associates with
                            Stalinist background, to ease restrictive domestic policies, and to give
                            more latitude to the restive liberals and intellectuals. So far this has
                            only sharpened the desires of the liberals for even more sweeping
                            reforms and has weakened party authority and <persName corresp="#p_NA1"

                            moderate. He owes his present position largely to Moscow's support,
                            which he must hold if he is to retain his leadership. The consideration
                            may account in part for the USSR's recent new credit to Bulgaria.</p>

                            developing internal strains. Among the contributing factors apparently
                            are his regime's imitation of some of Moscow's innovations in economic
                            policies; the rehabilitation of old party officials who were imprisoned
                            in the wake of Czechoslovakia's purges in the early 1950's; the
                            smoldering differences with other Eastern European countries—and perhaps
                            Moscow—on the subject of Berlin and Germany; and the problem of trying
                            to appear moderate to the outside world while pursuing harsh internal
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>De-Stalinization elsewhere in Eastern Europe heightens the anachronism of
                            the Stalinist <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>. Even
                            though in Moscow's view some liberalization of conditions in East
                            Germany would probably be desirable, his strong hand is needed to
                            inhibit the development of rivalries among potential successors. The
                            Soviet leaders dare not risk such a situation in East Germany in view of
                            their inability last winter to bring about a quick solution to the
                            problems posed by the anti-<persName corresp="#p_NA1">Novotny</persName>
                            elements in the Czech party.</p>

                            authority since his return to power in 1956. His politburo is aging;
                            four members are seriously ill, and a fifth post has remained vacant
                            since the ouster of Roman Zambrowski last July. Encouraged in part by
                            the seeming decline in Moscow's influence over the local affairs of the
                            Eastern European countries, a number of hard-line internal security
                            specialists in Poland are pressing against this weakened top layer of
                            their party. They reportedly have circulated a letter in the party
                            criticizing some of <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>'s
                            policies, apparently hoping to challenge him at a party congress to be

                            of his hard-line opponents into policy-making positions. Such a move
                            could bring about a significant tightening of his present moderate
                            policy.</p>

                        <p>In order to maintain the present degree of diversity in Eastern Europe
                            and the increasingly frequent expressions of national individuality, the
                            regime leaders recognize they must have the good will of the Soviet
                            Union. Their own self-interests dictate continued participation in
                            Soviet bloc activities. Nevertheless, as national interests come to the
                            fore in one satellite, similar interests are stimulated in others; and
                            each move <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0036"/>toward greater
                            independence spreads like an infection throughout the bloc which Moscow
                            may be able to limit but probably not fully control. As one Western
                            official notes, de-Stalinization in Eastern Europe inevitably leads to
                            “de-satellization.”</p>
                        <p>This fluid state in the Soviet bloc will continue. It may eventually
                            lead, although not without strife, to some loose form of relationship in
                            which each member would have reasonably broad freedom of action, a
                            belief that it is an equal partner, and an assurance that its own
                            interests will be respected. Such a grouping of independent Communist
                            states held together by mutual self-interest could constitute a
                            stronger, more viable system than an empire held in thrall by the Soviet
                            Union.</p>
                        <p>In this situation the countries of Eastern Europe will continue to evolve
                            toward a status as genuinely autonomous political entities, subject to
                            the pressures of national interests, rising popular expectations for a
                            better life, and a resurgence of the historical frictions that have
                            plagued the area for centuries.</p>

                        <p>The paper under consideration was described as an attempt to break
                            through the conventional vocabulary and stimulate thought and discussion
                            concerning basic assumptions of Western policy toward Eastern Europe. It
                            was submitted to the March 11–13 meeting of the Atlantic Policy Advisory
                            Group. The paper is framed by the intimate inter-relationship for
                            Western policy of what happens in Eastern Europe, in the <pb n="9"
                                xml:id="pg_9" facs="0037"/>USSR, and in divided Germany. It
                            identifies the forces at work in Eastern Europe which tend to promote
                            polycentrism—but within prevailing limits of Soviet security and
                            Communist control. It suggests that a central consideration in Western
                            policy toward the area is to further favorable evolutionary development
                            in the USSR. It indicates that the anticipated extension of current
                            trends there may present perils and opportunities for Western
                            policy—particularly in terms of German unification.</p>
                        <p>It was reported that discussion of the paper at the <gloss
                                target="#t_APAG1">APAG</gloss> meeting revealed general
                            gratification that “civilizing” influences are at work in Eastern
                            Europe, and substantial agreement that these should be promoted for
                            various reasons and by divers means including trade, cultural contacts
                            and exchanges. There was a range of opinion on the extent to which
                            Eastern Europe can be treated as a problem more or less separate from
                            the USSR, on the importance for Western policy of current trends (and of
                            Eastern Europe itself), and on the degree to which the West can
                            influence events in Eastern Europe.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_APAG1">APAG</gloss> representatives from the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Norway and Canada treated the German
                            problem gingerly and emphasized the efficacy of economic inducements to
                            channel Eastern Europe's momentum in desired directions. At the other
                            extreme, the representative of the Netherlands took a hard line,
                            centering on the German problem and according no significance to East
                            European developments as such. The middle ground was dominated by the
                            French representative who underlined the priority of the German problem
                            in relations with Eastern Europe, proposed exploitation of the political
                            attraction of the Common Market, and urged planning for possible, if
                            unlikely, large-scale violence in Eastern Europe.</p>
                        <p>The German <gloss target="#t_APAG1">APAG</gloss> representative hoped to
                            make reunification attractive in Eastern Europe and the USSR by such
                            means as a commitment not to change boundaries by force, a
                            discriminatory denuclearized zone, bilateral agreements for Observation
                            Posts and reparation payments. He indicated that relevant German policy
                            attitudes vary from: (a) passive observation of the unfolding of history
                            in the East, through (b) attempts to influence liberalizing forces in
                            the area and (c) working by means of trade, contacts, etc. in the area,
                            to (d) encouraging Eastern Europeans to negotiate while intensifying
                            contacts with East Germany. He pointed to rising German sentiment for
                            unification and forecast that issue would prove a critical test of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Alliance. He thought in the
                            event of another uprising in East Germany that the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would leave the Alliance if nothing
                            were done to move the cause of Germany forward.</p>
                        <p>It was suggested that the basic lesson of the recent <gloss
                                target="#t_APAG1">APAG</gloss> meeting and of the paper discussed
                            may be that the future of Eastern Europe is inextricably bound up with
                            questions of German unity and political freedom for East Germany.
                            Perhaps we need to begin to think hard about Eastern Europe not only
                            because current developments there are welcome <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10"
                                facs="0038"/>signs of independence, but because these developments
                            might lead to conditions under which the Soviet Union could accept a
                            Germany united in freedom. We must recognize, however, that if the USSR
                            gave up East Germany, it already or soon would have no ideological
                            empire left in Eastern Europe. To do that the USSR would have to be much
                            more Russian and less Communist. Nonetheless, the decisive question
                            remains: will Moscow accept the ideological loss of East Germany and
                            Eastern Europe?</p>
                        <p>The ensuing discussion of the paper centered around the following major
                            topics: <list>

                                    suggested that the UN is relevant in the sense that Articles I
                                    and II of the UN Charter set forth standards of sovereign
                                    independence to which we adhere and can encourage others to
                                    adhere. We need not unilaterally shoulder the burden of urging
                                    the Soviet Union to divest itself of empire in Eastern

                                        <hi rend="italic">Role of Ideology</hi>. It was pointed out
                                        that the Soviets have made such a religion of communism that
                                        the ideology lives on in twisted form forty years after its
                                        legitimate death with Lenin. That religion is now out of
                                        date and must adapt or perish. If the USSR sticks to its
                                        unworkable tenets it will be inviting increasing trouble,
                                        making peaceful competition impossible ideologically as well
                                        as economically. In this sense the Chinese Communists are
                                        correct; i.e., genuine co-existence and orthodox Communist
                                        ideology are incompatible.</p>
                                    <p>It was noted that our principal concern is the external
                                        relations of countries not their internal policies. However,
                                        the latter may shape external relations in objectionable
                                        fashion.</p>

                                        There was discussion of the extent to which it is possible
                                        to view policy toward Eastern Europe in relative isolation
                                        from policy toward the USSR. The opinion was expressed that
                                        the main question must remain, what can we do in Eastern
                                        Europe to speed up evolution in the USSR? It was explained,
                                        with reference to ideology, that further evolution is
                                        essential to make it possible for the Soviet Union to accept
                                        a reunited Germany.</p>
                                    <p>On the other hand, it was noted that long-range policy toward
                                        Eastern Europe envisages full independence and sovereign
                                        relations for those countries with the free world and with
                                        the UN. A concern was expressed with inadequate focus on the
                                        goal of an independent Eastern Europe and at the possible
                                        implication that if the Soviets behaved the US would
                                        accommodate to Communist domination in Eastern Europe.</p>
                                    <p>It was pointed out that it is perhaps unnecessary to think
                                        about Eastern Europe in terms of our gain is the Soviet's
                                        loss and vice versa. We don't need the Eastern European
                                        countries on our side—we don't seek them as allies.
                                        Moreover, there is little practical likelihood of Eastern
                                        Europe being frozen into a polycentric status. There is too
                                        much political <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0039"

                                        leaderships. It clearly is not enough simply to encourage
                                        developments in Eastern Europe without considering the
                                        effects on the USSR and on the German problem, in large part
                                        through the USSR.</p>

                                        <hi rend="italic">The German Problem</hi>. It was noted that
                                        there appear to be two routes to German
                                        unification—confrontation and détente. The former has proven
                                        unsuccessful since 1945; the latter has yet to be tested. It
                                        would, however, present different security problems to the
                                        USSR. Soviet concern, it was argued by some, is far less
                                        with the security threat of a unified Germany than with the
                                        domino effect in Eastern Europe of the loss of East
                                        Germany.</p>
                                    <p>There was discussion of the impact on Soviet security of a
                                        unified Germany with meaningful security and disarmament
                                        arrangements. The opinion was expressed that if unification
                                        were evolutionary and without violence, Soviet concerns
                                        might be satisfied. Another view was that the security
                                        problem in Soviet eyes includes the threat of eventual
                                        German offensive capability, or at least of a German
                                        capability to spark a conflagration.</p>

                                    increments, but historical trends may now outrun manageable
                                    rates and magnitudes. Thus, the US need prepare for crises in
                                    the area lest we freeze as we did at Budapest or act in haste

                            the USSR seems a permanent condition if for no other reason that the
                            USSR has no economic possibility of satisfying the aspirations of the

                        <p>Following a brief opening exchange about the situation in Southeast Asia,
                            the Secretary asked Herr <persName>Strauss</persName> for his views as
                            to what was going on in Eastern Europe. He cited the example of Rumania
                            where, among other developments, the government had recently referred to
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as a “thief”.<note

                            <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said he was very
                            interested in this situation. He had recently talked to a journalist
                            from <hi rend="italic">Die Welt</hi> who had returned from a trip to the
                            Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The journalist had told of the
                            existence of an open anti-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> movement in Soviet Georgia. Young people
                            seemed to be particularly involved in this movement and the police were
                            apparently helpless to do anything about it. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1"
                                >Strauss</persName> felt that his information on this situation was
                            insufficient and he wanted to look into it further when he returned to
                            Germany. He said that the big question was how far the leaders of the
                            Eastern European countries could go against Moscow without eliminating
                            themselves, either by provoking Moscow to some action against them or as
                            a result of internal disturbance. He felt that national Communism was
                            not possible without the protective umbrella of Moscow. Should this
                            umbrella be removed, it would be only a few months before the Communist
                            regimes in Eastern Europe would be upset. The problem for these regimes,
                            therefore, was to try to balance between gaining more independence and
                            not losing the protection of Moscow against internal upheavals. Another
                            factor in the picture, <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>
                            continued, was the resentment felt by the peoples in Eastern Europe
                            against Soviet economic exploitation.</p>
                        <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0042"/>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that he had had in the past extensive contacts
                            with scientists from Eastern Europe and he had been made aware of their
                            strong resentment against the second-class status in scientific matters
                            which had been accorded them by Moscow. In addition to the dangers in
                            Southeast Asia, the events in Eastern Europe were in his opinion among
                            the most interesting developments in the world picture today. <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> appeared to be getting worried
                            over a sense of increasing isolation from the rest of Eastern Europe.
                            Today the winds of liberalism were even blowing out of Prague of all
                            places. The Secretary inquired of <persName>Strauss</persName> where he
                            thought this trend would lead us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> replied that “this
                            depends on us”. There were two extremes; on the one hand, the mood of
                            détente might lead people to ask why, if we are moving to normal
                            relations with the Communist countries in Eastern Europe, should we not
                            also have normal relations with <persName corresp="#p_UW1"
                                >Ulbricht</persName>; on the other hand, a policy could be pursued
                            tenaciously to make <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> an
                            intolerable burden to Moscow. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1"
                                >Strauss</persName> said he felt it should be recognized how
                            difficult it would be for the Soviets to replace the Communist regime in
                            East Germany. He had always said that the German problem could not be
                            separated from its context, and he felt the objective should be to bring
                            about a situation where Moscow would be prepared to normalize the
                            situation on the basis of increasing self-determination in the areas
                            under its control.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> continued that there were
                            three points in the area of East-West relations that he wished to

                        <p>The Secretary said he thought it was possible that in the period
                            immediately ahead we might find <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> more adamant than ever about the German
                            question. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> fully
                            recognized that if Soviet troops were pulled out of East Germany he
                            could end up by losing all of Eastern Europe. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said this was why he was
                            convinced the German problem could not be separated from its European
                            context. In a sense the 22 Soviet divisions in East Germany were a
                            garrison for the entire Soviet <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0043"
                            />“belt” in Eastern Europe. He agreed with the Secretary that there was
                            not much hope for a short-range solution. One factor was the importance
                            of ideology—if one Communist regime should fall back into the ranks of
                            capitalism, this would represent a great setback to the world Communist
                            movement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred in this connection to the current controversy
                            between Moscow and Peiping and said that from the standpoint of orthodox
                            Communist principles Peiping was right; any really genuine peaceful
                            co-existence which could be achieved would basically transform the
                            character of world Communism.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> cited the case of
                            Austria, and said that what had happened there was not applicable to the
                            German situation. In Austria the Russians had never established a
                            Communist regime. This meant that they could retreat from Austria
                            without losing any face. This was impossible in Germany where there was
                            a Communist regime. Should the Soviets stop upholding this regime and
                            permit free elections, 90 percent of the people would vote against it.
                            This would represent a great defeat for world Communism.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to our recent talks with the Rumanian trade
                                delegation.<note n="4" xml:id="d5fn4">See <ref target="#d142"
                                    >Documents 142</ref> and <ref target="#d143">143</ref>.</note>
                            While there had been no anti-Soviet talk from either side, he felt that
                            the net effect had been to encourage Rumanian national feeling. He
                            agreed with <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> that the
                            problems of Germany and of Eastern Europe were part of the same complex;
                            the 22 Soviet divisions in East Germany helped the Soviets maintain
                            control over the situation throughout Eastern Europe. He also agreed
                            with <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> that there was a
                            limit beyond which the Communist governments in Eastern Europe would
                            find it difficult to go. All this did not make the solution of the
                            German problem any easier.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said he agreed we could
                            not expect too much. The Poles, Czechs and others would have to be
                            careful to “stop short of the threshold”.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to the recent increase in tourism from West
                            Germany to Eastern Europe as a new and important factor in helping to
                            mitigate fear of Germany in Eastern Europe. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1"
                                >Strauss</persName> agreed. He said that the fear of Germany in
                            these countries was one of Moscow's strongest instruments. It was most
                            important to take away the “nightmare” of the German military threat
                            from the peoples of Eastern Europe, although some of the governments in
                            that area might need a supposed German threat to remain in power.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that he had repeatedly cautioned about any
                            complacency developing over any atmosphere of détente. It was <pb n="16"
                                xml:id="pg_16" facs="0044"/>important to bear in mind that the range
                            of US-Soviet agreements thus far was very small and that all the big
                            questions, such as the German problem, still remained unresolved. We
                            were concerned that any feeling of détente might cause the peoples in
                            Western Europe to relax prematurely.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> agreed there were dangers
                            in any détente atmosphere. For one thing, he felt very strongly that we
                            must destroy the idea that a détente means a series of concessions to
                            the Soviets. Another danger was that in looking for material comforts
                            and advantages out of a détente we could all fall asleep at the expense
                            of our military posture.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that at one point we had been concerned about a double
                            standard which seemed to exist, particularly in the matter of East-West
                            trade. For example, when we sold wheat to Russia there was an outcry
                            from Europe, although European trade with the Communist world was much
                            greater than our own. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>
                            said he agreed and felt that “there had been a lot of hypocrisy in
                            Europe on the matter”. Speaking personally, he would like to have as
                            little trade as possible with the Soviets and Eastern Europe. The
                            Secretary said he wondered, however, whether we should not consider how
                            important a stake the Eastern Europeans might acquire in East-West
                            trade. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> agreed this was a
                            factor and said maybe we should use trade as a political weapon without
                            saying so. The Secretary said this would be fine if we could all move in
                            step together, but we had not succeeded in doing so over the past 17
                            years. He cited current disagreements over long-term credits to the
                            Soviet Union as an example.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s
                            basic problem was to try to maintain solidarity in a time of peace and
                            prosperity. There was of course no problem in this regard in times of
                            real trouble. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said he
                            agreed. We seemed to be further from a real military crisis in Europe
                            than at any time since 1945. He added that despite tendencies in other
                            parts of Western Europe, there was no pressure in Germany to reduce the
                            18-month period of conscription.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that another big problem facing <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was whether the member countries
                            could have common policies, if not common actions, in other parts of the
                            world where a Communist threat existed. In the US we felt that these
                            problems could not be separated, since they formed part and parcel of
                            the world-wide Communist threat. If there were real trouble in Southeast
                            Asia, this also raised a threat to Europe.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said he wondered what
                            Moscow would do if the US and China got into real trouble with each
                            other in Southeast Asia. He himself felt that Moscow would welcome this.
                            The Secretary said one thing which was sure: there would not be another
                            Korea in Southeast Asia. The military situation now was much different
                            and our own military posture much better than at that time.</p>
                        <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0045"/>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that the big question was how to get Peiping and
                            Hanoi to realize where they were going before they went too far. They
                            seemed to have a rather primitive view of the situation.
                                <persName>Strauss</persName> inquired with a smile whether the
                            Secretary was elaborating a contingency plan for action. The Secretary
                            replied that one plan we were not studying was how to get out of
                            Southeast Asia. We would not get out. The consequences would be a chain
                            reaction throughout Asia and the Middle East which would extend even
                            into Western Europe. He felt that while Europe might be somewhat
                            disinterested now in Southeast Asia, they would lose this disinterest
                            rapidly if the US were to leave Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said it was a pity that
                            the movement toward European unity had not made further progress. The
                            Secretary agreed that it was a tragedy that when there was such disarray
                            in the Communist Bloc, the West also seemed incapable of united
                            action.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> said he knew that the
                            Germans should be prepared to accept greater commitments in the world at
                            large, but there was a difficulty arising from German memories of the
                            disasters suffered in their past history as a world power. These
                            memories had tended to make the German people more narrow-minded and
                            provincial. He felt he must add that the Allied program after the last
                            war for “re-educating” the German people had been partly responsible for
                            this attitude in Germany.</p>

                                shown growing interest in increasing their imports from the US,
                                primarily of advanced technical equipment, but also of agricultural
                                and other products. Some of these goods are denied the Eastern
                                European countries by means of US export licensing restrictions.
                                Moreover, the ability of these countries to pay for imports from the
                                US is limited since they are denied access to commercial credit and
                                are not accorded Most Favored Nation (<gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                    >MFN</gloss>) treatment. Partly for these reasons, and partly
                                because of domestic economic priorities, the East European countries
                                have not made a major effort to develop production of goods

                                machinery and equipment has increased. Bulgaria, the least developed
                                of the Eastern European countries except for Albania, has a vital
                                and continuing need for foreign equipment, technical assistance, and
                                credits. The USSR has provided this support and recently granted
                                Bulgaria a credit of $333 million. Bulgarian interest in increased
                                trade with the US, therefore, probably would be mainly long-term and

                                new legislation would be to liberalize US licensing requirements and
                                make available normal commercial credits. Licensing policy toward
                                Eastern Europe, however, involves questions of what constitutes
                                “strategic goods” and of policy toward the Soviet Union, which may
                                have access to products and technology sold to Eastern Europe.

                                disintegration, and the next several years by consolidation and
                                relative quiet. The present is marked once more by a preoccupation
                                with change and we look for a period of political liveliness and

                                the national future, within the framework of a Communist system,
                                which is being subjected to examination and experiment. The internal
                                issues are those of liberalization and economic reform. These in

                                feeling free to approach these questions less in the light of Soviet
                                wishes or the supposed common interests of the Bloc, more in the
                                light of national aspirations and local political conditions.

                                several years, is a growing diversification in Eastern Europe.
                                Outsiders, including the USSR, will find it increasingly hard to
                                apply a general analysis and a general policy to the area. We expect
                                in most of these countries some movement toward political
                                liberalization and a search for better balance and more efficient
                                methods in managing the economy. Economic progress, while likely to
                                show some improvement over the generally dismal record of the last
                                two years, will not be such as to diminish dissatisfaction and
                                impatience in the near future. Political evolution is not likely to

                            <item>In external relations, we expect a similar uneven evolution away
                                from the tutelage of Moscow and toward closer contacts with Western
                                Europe and the US. We believe that the Soviets would consider direct
                                military intervention in Eastern Europe only in emergency
                                circumstances, when they believed vital Soviet interest to be
                                threatened. In political terms, the irreducible Soviet demand
                                probably is that these regimes should remain professedly Communist
                                and continue at least formal membership in the Warsaw Pact. So long
                                as these limits are not transgressed we believe that the USSR is
                                prepared to tolerate considerable divergence in internal policies
                                and even to acquiesce reluctantly in further manifestations of
                                independence in foreign policy. Most countries will almost certainly
                                seek to develop their economic and cultural relations with the West
                                at a rapid rate, though the economies of Eastern Europe will remain
                                closely tied to that of the USSR. (Paras. 24, 31–32, 34, 36)</item>

                            <item>Though we believe that these trends will unfold gradually and
                                without major upheavals, we are conscious of the possibility of
                                sharp instability and even violent shifts. The chances of change of
                                this sort depend to some extent upon each country's success in
                                managing domestic problems and party factionalism. Developments in
                                the Soviet Union will probably be equally important. If the USSR
                                continues to falter in its competition with the West, to lose
                                prestige in the contest within the Communist movement, or to give an
                                impression of uncertainty in its policy, Eastern European
                                nationalism may be moved to bolder ventures. These possibilities
                                will also be heightened during the succession period in Soviet
                                politics, which is likely to breed factionalism, nervousness, and
                                exaggerated hopes and fears in Eastern Europe. (Paras. 26–27)</item>

                            as a wide-ranging response which should distinguish more clearly between

                            feasible as developments in East Europe progressed. Two specific
                            criticisms were made: (1) it fails to distinguish between East Germany
                            and the other East European states; (2) the proposal to encourage West
                            Germany to modify the Hallstein Doctrine<note n="5" xml:id="d8fn5"

                        <p>The policy paper received general acclaim for its worth in boldly
                            proposing a line of policy. It was criticized on the following counts: <list>

                                <item>The paper is overstated in its optimism concerning both the
                                    analysis of the evolution of the East European nations and the
                                    action programs proposed. The ideological aspect is understated:
                                    these are strong Communist regimes. The possibility of a
                                    “Marshall Plan” approach is overstated. The paper needs to
                                    emphasize that its proposals are long-run in nature and
                                    cumulative in effect.</item>

                                <item>There is an overemphasis of the beneficial effects upon the

                                    “Reconciliation” with the West may have a reverse effect,
                                    causing the Soviet succession to eventuate in a regime
                                    determined to hold Eastern Europe in its grip. We must be
                                    cautious, since our East European policy will affect the Soviet
                                    succession.</item>

                                <item>In any case, “reconciliation” is a dangerous word politically,
                                    implying that we are reconciled to the suppression of the East
                                    European peoples by their Communist governments. A new word or
                                    phrase should be found. Moreover, the paper's proposals seem to
                                    lend support to these governments at the expense of the people,
                                    who, in some cases, are suppressed in a most Stalinist
                                    way.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>The paper should delve deeper into the relationship of the
                                    “reconciliation” process to German reunification and Central
                                    European security arrangements. The long-run erosion of East
                                    European ideological unity may well contribute to the progress
                                    on a German settlement.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>The paper should not permanently preclude the possibility of
                                    “reconciliation” with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as
                                    well. Instead of “isolating” East Germany, why not consider the
                                    same “reconciliation” policy toward it as toward the other East
                                    European states? This could help to promote German
                                    reunification.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>(This suggestion was rebutted on two grounds: (1) the internal effect in
                            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> of such a policy would render it
                            self-defeating. Alienated West Germans might turn to a strong
                            nationalist government which would by its character retard the desired
                            evolution and “reconciliation” in Eastern Europe. (2) A “reconciled”
                            Titoist-minded East Germany would cause the Soviets to hold on to it
                            that much harder.)</p>
                        <p>In discussion it was emphasized that we must not allow our Eastern
                            European policy to be vetoed by Bonn. There is a certain amount of
                            hypocrisy in the German objections to enlarged US contacts with the
                            East. A short paper was requested outlining the differences between our
                            present Eastern European policy and what that policy would be were we to
                            go as far as the Germans in our contacts with the East. It was also
                            suggested that an article on the Eastern European situation written by
                                <persName>John Strachey</persName> for <hi rend="italic"
                                >Encounter</hi> be distributed.<note n="6" xml:id="d8fn6">Reference

                        <p>The problem of what kind of public statement on our Eastern European
                            policy could be issued was discussed at length. In brief, the problem is
                            how to talk about our objectives without getting in their way. Two
                            points of view developed: one holding that for the present we should
                            keep as quiet as possible, the other holding (with the <gloss
                                target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> paper) that the President should issue a
                            public statement enlarging upon his “bridgebuilding” speech. The
                            following reasons were advanced against a public statement: <list>

                        <p>Concerning trade relations with Eastern Europe, it was cautioned that we
                            must look into the deeper implications of <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> treatment. The problem is what do we do when we achieve
                            this? Tariffs are of no significance to Communist nations with state
                            trading systems. We must realize that these nations will have state
                            trading for the foreseeable future. This means that their presence in
                            the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> might disrupt that already
                            fragile body; we must consider this when we respond to their overtures
                            for closer relations with the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. In
                            the case of the USSR, we should not extend <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> until they settle some outstanding claims, including
                            lend-lease.</p>
                        <p>Divergent opinions were expressed concerning whether the “reconciliation”
                            of Eastern Europe should have a primarily European or an Atlantic
                            orientation. It was held that the US has the most prestige of any
                            Western nation in Eastern Europe and that we should maximize the
                            presence of Americans there. It would be a mistake to overemphasize
                            Eastern European association with Western Europe. The structure of the
                            latter is weak already, and the association of Eastern European states
                            would only dilute it further. Eastern Europe should develop closer links
                            with the Atlantic Community as a whole. Cooperation on specific subjects
                            within the framework of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> might
                            be useful. But the view was expressed that apart from the possibilities
                            of arranging European-wide cooperation in some technical fields such as
                            highway safety standards, the Council of Europe could do little in
                            associating Eastern Europe with the West.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, it was held that rather than trumpeting a new US
                            policy toward Eastern Europe it would be wiser to conform our policy
                            with that of Western Europe first. The Europeans are not at present <pb
                                n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0054"/>unhappy to see the US a minority

                            pushing on, we should first catch up with our European allies.</p>
                        <p>Both Western Europe and the US have tools with which to help loosen the
                            Eastern European “bloc.” Western Europe has geography, history, and such
                            things as common waterways to weigh in the balance. The US has other
                            assets such as the six million Americans of Polish extraction.</p>
                        <p>The following additional problems were mentioned:</p>
                        <p>The process of “reconciliation” with Eastern Europe raises three
                            questions concerning its future orientation: (a) the connection between
                            Eastern and Western Europe; (b) the connection between Eastern Europe
                            and the US, and (c) between Eastern Europe and worldwide institutions.
                            In addition, this process raises the question of how the US can consult
                            with its Western European allies on policy toward Eastern Europe.
                            Systematic consultation is needed at operational levels. This could be
                            done in the Quadripartite Group or in the <gloss target="#t_NAC1"
                                >NAC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>It was suggested that in our public statements we should stress our
                            desire to improve relations with all Communist states, including Soviet
                            Russia, and not just with “special cases” in Eastern Europe. Otherwise,
                            if the Soviets receive the impression that we are fomenting difficulties
                            for them in Eastern Europe, this would be contrary to our long-run
                            policy of achieving understanding with the Soviet Union.</p>

                        <p>Dear Bob:</p>
                        <p>I am disturbed by the effect on our relations with the Union of Soviet
                            Socialist Republics and Poland of the recent incidents involving clashes
                                <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0055"/>between United States
                            Military Attachés and local officials in those two countries. I have in
                            mind particularly the Khabarovsk affair and the shooting incident in
                                Poland.<note n="2" xml:id="d9fn2">Documentation on the incident in
                                Khabarovsk, September 28, is in <ref target="frus1964-68v14">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, volume
                                    XIV</ref>. The reference to a shooting incident has not been
                                identified.</note> These are the latest manifestations of a problem
                            which has caused serious difficulties in our relations with the
                            Communist countries for some years. Although the fault lies in most
                            instances with the authorities of the other governments concerned, our
                            people sometimes contribute to incidents through over-zealousness,
                            violation of local laws or failure to appreciate the responsibilities
                            underlying the enjoyment of diplomatic privileges and immunities.</p>
                        <p>I think the time has come to review our policies, regulations and
                            instructions governing the intelligence-gathering activities of our
                            military personnel in the Communist countries of Eastern Europe and the
                            Soviet Union in an effort to reduce the chance of future incidents which
                            might cause further complications in the pursuit of our over-all foreign
                            policy objectives. We are also concerned that the present trend, if not
                            checked, may result in the curtailment or even termination of the
                            activities of our Attachs in the Communist countries. There have
                            occurred in the past few years several developments that have a
                            significant bearing on this problem. In the first place opportunities
                            for political gains among these countries have increased, while the
                            improvement in our relative power position and a reduction in
                            U.S.-U.S.S.R. tensions have reduced the likelihood of military
                            engagement. Second, other methods of intelligence collection have become
                            available, thereby raising the question whether the risks Attachés
                            should take need be so great as formerly. A further relevant
                            consideration is that last year for the first time we imposed
                            restrictions in the form of closed zones on the movement of Attachés of
                            the Eastern European countries in the United States.<note n="3"

                            regard for reciprocity, has, as expected, produced a reaction from the
                            Eastern European Governments prejudicial to our relations with them and
                            to the environment in which our Attachés operate.</p>
                        <p>The Department and our diplomatic missions abroad, particularly those in
                            Communist countries, appreciate the contribution of our Military
                            Attachés to national security. Their responsibilities receive and will
                            continue to receive the full support of the Department of State and our
                            Ambassadors as one of several important and interrelated functions of
                            our diplomatic posts. In the light of recent developments, however, we
                            should make sure, in the effort to protect the diplomatic immunity of
                            the Military Attachés themselves as well as all other members of our
                            missions <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0056"/>in Eastern Europe and

                            possible to diplomatic standards. I have two suggestions.</p>

                        <p rend="center">SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>Soviet control of Eastern Europe is gradually being whittled away.
                            Changes within the USSR itself, a surge of Eastern European nationalism,
                            a general disenchantment with traditional forms of Marxist economics and
                            harsh Soviet-style politics, and the growing attraction of the West have
                            all combined to give the states of Eastern Europe both the incentive and
                            the opportunity for striking out on their own. Rumania, the most daring
                            exemplar of the new trends, has made especially telling use of the force
                            of nationalism and is fast approaching a degree of independence
                            comparable to that enjoyed by Yugoslavia. Others—except for East Germany
                            and perhaps Bulgaria—in their own way are likely over the long term to
                            follow suit. The Soviets, for their part, will find it difficult to
                            arrest the process, and though crises are an ever-present danger, we
                            believe that these countries will be able successfully to assert their
                            own national interests gradually and without provoking Soviet
                            intervention. In ways unforeseen by both the Soviet Union and the West,
                            communism is taking firmer root in Eastern Europe, but it is a truly
                            national communism which is doing so. It is, in fact, much closer to the
                            traditional interests of the individual countries involved and much more
                            remote from the interests and the ambitions of the USSR.</p>
                        <p rend="center">I. Introduction</p>
                        <p>1. Twenty years after the end of the war and the occupation of Eastern
                            Europe by Soviet armies, Stalin's empire has begun to show signs of <pb
                                n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0058"/>considerable disarray. Unlike the
                            first national defection from the Bloc, Yugoslavia in 1948, and the
                            violent eruptions in Hungary in 1956, the current process of withdrawal
                            from Soviet dominance is gradual and unspectacular. It lacks the drama
                            of sudden political upheavals, and thus does not challenge the USSR with
                            provocative acts sufficient to justify armed intervention. It lacks the
                            finality of a complete severance of the bonds between protectorate and
                            overlord, and thus it is sometimes difficult to know precisely where
                            relations stand and in what direction they are likely to go. But it does
                            not lack for a potential fully as meaningful as that inherent in
                            previous, more vivid crises in Soviet-Eastern European relations.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>2. The states of Eastern Europe remain generally within the Soviet sphere
                            of influence, and each is affected—though not in equal degree—by the
                            policies and interests of Moscow. But these countries now move in
                            increasingly eccentric orbits around the center, and their responses to
                            Soviet demands and their abilities to pursue their own national
                            interests vary widely from state to state.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s decisions to
                            de-Stalinize and to improve relations with Tito's Yugoslavia were
                            probably the prime movers in this process. The rulers of these countries
                            soon found that without Stalin, his apparatus of terror, and his awesome
                            mystique, they could no longer reign in the grand and arbitrary manner
                            of Stalin. Even more important, the Soviets themselves discovered that,
                            without Stalin, they could no longer operate at will within his empire.
                            Stalin had been able to appoint the Satellite leaders, purge them at
                            will, and control all the vital levers of power within each state. Not
                            so his successors.</p>
                        <p>4. Gradually, perhaps so slowly as to defy even Moscow's awareness of
                            what was taking place, Soviet means of control were whittled away, both
                            by happenstance and by design. The Soviets could not stop <persName
                                corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>'s accession to power in Poland,
                            and, having failed in this, they could not reassert their dominance over
                            his party. It was much the same story for a time in Hungary, where the
                            appointment of Gero to succeed Rakosi was intended to insure continued
                            Soviet dominance but led in fact to the opposite.</p>
                        <p>5. There was some reconsolidation in the years which immediately followed
                            the Hungarian Revolution, but this was a transitory phenomenon which
                            rested as much on the dispositions of the Satellite parties
                            themselves—especially their fears of insurrection—as on the actual
                            instruments of Soviet power. But Moscow had apparently forgotten its
                            lesson, for its crude attempts in 1961 to bring a Soviet faction to
                            power in Albania met with complete, humiliating failure.</p>
                        <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0059"/>
                        <p>6. It fell to the Rumanians to recognize and exploit the new situation.
                            They saw the opportunity, had the motive, and gathered the means. The
                            opportunity was the Sino-Soviet dispute and the USSR's growing warmness
                            toward the West; the means were both economic (oil and corn and timber)
                            and political (a unified leadership); and the motive was nationalism and
                            the desire of the regime to seize this fervor to bolster its own
                            position.</p>
                        <p>7. In addition to these reasons underlying change in Eastern Europe—the
                            surge of nationalism, evolution in the USSR—are a number of factors that
                            grew of their own accord within the area itself. In economics, adversity
                            in effect bred diversity. The slowdown in growth and other severe
                            shortcomings in the economies of most of these states led to a
                            reexamination of the Soviet way of doing things and to a new look at the
                            tenets of the doctrine which underlay the entire economic scheme of
                            things in each of these countries.</p>
                        <p>8. It soon occurred to everyone but the most hard bitten and doctrinaire
                            that Soviet methods were obsolete, especially for the more
                            industrialized countries. It was then easy to exaggerate the degree to
                            which these economies had been exploited by the Soviets and to blame
                            current miseries on past Soviet sins. It was also found that
                            Marxism-Leninism was simply inadequate to show the East Europeans the
                            way out of their troubles, and that the Soviet Union was unwilling to
                            devote sufficient resources to bail them out. The East Europeans
                            therefore had to turn elsewhere. They looked at the Yugoslav system,
                            which was a strange, though functioning, amalgam of socialist ownership,
                            state direction, and a market mechanism. They also turned to the West,
                            sometimes only for the tools of better planning and management, but in
                            some cases to seek radical ways of changing the economic system.</p>
                        <p>9. Here the great successes of the Germans and the French and the faraway
                            technological spectacular of the US told them that, far from collapsing
                            from its own crises, the capitalist world was booming as never before.
                            The Eastern Europeans travelled to the West and sought information and
                            help, and they encouraged visitations of Western economic officials and
                            businessmen to their own plants. Homegrown economists began to do
                            without the shibboleths of Marxism and abandoned the jargon as well. In
                            its place they began to talk among themselves, and then to party
                            functionaries, about interest charges on capital, the market, supply and
                            demand, and even the role of profits.</p>
                        <p>10. While the official outlook was thus being transformed, the popular
                            mood was growing more restive. Years of doing without—of poor housing,
                            starchy diets, few consumer goods—and of hard work for low pay had begun
                            to take their toll. The very gradual improvements in living standards
                            merely whetted appetites for more, and soon public discontent
                            transmitted itself to the leaderships in general and to <pb n="32"
                                xml:id="pg_32" facs="0060"/>reform-minded elements within the
                            leaderships in particular. Clearly, if labor were to perform as asked
                            and if the people as a whole were to cooperate at all with the regime's
                            programs, improvements had to be made. And to allow such improvements,
                            the economies themselves had to become stronger and grow faster.</p>
                        <p>11. These changes in attitude led, though at a varying pace, to efforts
                            to reform the economies, to make them more responsive to popular
                            demands, and to get them on the move again. Doctrine inevitably suffered
                            in the process. It was as if, beginning with the economy, ideology were
                            being chipped away piece by piece. But quite clearly, Marxism-Leninism
                            was never meant to be applied—or even believed in—as a selective
                            philosophy. It may change, but it is intended to be a coherent doctrine
                            not subject to the erosion of its fundamentals.</p>
                        <p>12. Encouraged by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                            “revisionism“, by the sanctioning of the Yugoslav “road to socialism,”
                            and by the split between the USSR and China, changes were made in
                            Eastern Europe which only a few years before would have been quite
                            unthinkable. Some of these innovations were solely political in concept,
                            such as the Hungarian regime's public judgment that those not actively
                            against it would henceforth be considered for it. Some were mainly
                            economic, though with political implications, such as the spirited
                            debate over economics waged in official publications, especially in
                            Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. And some were purely economic in origin,
                            but even here—as is the case with the turn toward “market socialism” in
                            Czechoslovakia—there will be important political repercussions.</p>
                        <p>13. Changes in economic thought and in ideology were paralleled by a
                            relaxation of political controls and a generally more permissive
                            attitude on the part of the regimes. The knock on the door in the early
                            morning was done away with, conversation became considerably freer, and
                            barriers against the intrusion of Western ideas into the closed
                            societies were penetrated, sometimes with official encouragement,
                            sometimes despite official discouragement. European culture—books,
                            plays, movies—received widespread distribution in most of the area. The
                            move toward European unity appealed to many in Eastern Europe who saw in
                            it a way of escaping Soviet domination. Intellectual ferment once more
                            became widespread and authors began again to write of contemporary
                            problems with more realism than socialism. Such “radical” and
                            antitotalitarian authors as Franz Kafka were taken off the index
                            everywhere except in East Germany, and the population at large was
                            exposed to Western radio broadcasts without jamming. All in all, the
                            life of the average man became both more comfortable and freer; if the
                            regimes were looked upon with no less contempt, they could nonetheless
                            be suffered without the overriding anxiety and fear produced by the
                            Stalinist insistence on absolute conformity.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>14. The Soviet ability to help chart the course of history in Eastern
                            Europe rests ultimately on its proximity and the preponderance of its
                            military power. The USSR's invasion of Hungary in 1956 demonstrated
                            forcefully for all of Eastern Europe this ultimate means of Soviet
                            control. But military power has traditionally been used by the Soviets
                            in quite another sense, as a prop for the local regimes against trouble
                            at home or threats from abroad. But time and international change have
                            tended to diminish the value of the Soviet protective umbrella for the
                            individual East European regimes. Only in the ultimate sense of survival
                            under the threat of an actual invasion from the West or internal
                            insurrection which cannot be handled by local forces do these regimes
                            look to the USSR for support. Even in these instances, the situation has
                            changed appreciably, for the West no longer professes a policy of
                            rollback and “liberation” and the people no longer consider revolt to be
                            a feasible or even desirable course of action.</p>
                        <p>15. After the initial period of occupation and the establishment of lines
                            of control, Stalin did not depend heavily on the USSR's military power.
                            Rather, he relied principally on his direct control of the indigenous
                            parties and their leaders. These organizations and these men were almost
                            wholly dependent on the USSR for their very existence; certainly they
                            had few local strengths and few resources with which to confront the
                            USSR. But this situation has since changed radically. After some twenty
                            years in power, these regimes have been able to one degree or another to
                            build up indigenous sources of strength. A good deal of their power now
                            rests on the local parties themselves.</p>
                        <p>16. Thus Moscow's influence on these parties now depends not on direct
                            control but on indirect influence. It may persuade and bribe, but it can
                            no longer merely issue instructions with any degree of confidence that
                            they will be followed. As the first governing Communist party in history
                            and as the fount of Communist wisdom, it commands considerable respect
                            and some degree of loyalty from its former client parties. Certainly it
                            will be listened to, if not obeyed, and in at least one respect, the
                            Sino-Soviet dispute has increased Soviet prestige and mellowed Soviet
                            doctrine—almost all the Eastern European countries are horrified by the
                            Chinese version of the ideology. Otherwise, however, this reservoir of
                            respect and loyalty has been diminished by the acts of the Soviets
                            themselves, their juggling of doctrine, their denunciation of Stalin and
                            his works, their inability to provide firm leadership to the
                            international movement, and, most recently their overthrow and criticism
                            of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                        <p>17. Soviet foreign policies form another means of guiding Eastern
                            European destinies. Soviet policy toward Germany, for example, conforms
                            well with the fears, aspirations, and prejudices of many of the <pb
                                n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0062"/>Eastern European governments and
                            peoples, especially those that suffered most acutely during World War
                            II. Further, to the extent that disputes erupt between these states,
                            Moscow plays an influential role in its capacity as adjudicator and
                            referee. It can use traditional hostilities between them for its own
                            purposes and, by siding with one country or another, can use these
                            enmities to barter and to threaten. The Rumanians, for example, are
                            convinced that the Soviets have privately encouraged Hungary to agitate
                            over Rumania's policies in Transylvania.</p>
                        <p>18. In more general terms, the size, prestige, and awesome political and
                            economic power of the USSR provide it with still another lever, distinct
                            from that provided by sheer military strength. As has always been the
                            case in relations between large and small states, the power of the
                            larger can be used as a form of pressure against the smaller. This is
                            particularly useful in seeking to curb policies which are specifically
                            hostile in intent, and thus helps to define the limits of independent
                            action for the smaller states; it constitutes a barrier of sorts against
                            radical forms of defiance.</p>
                        <p>19. Finally, the Soviets maintain a method of influencing Eastern Europe
                            through a variety of economic devices. But, if they have learned their
                            lessons, they must realize that the use of economic pressure frequently
                            has disappointing results; Yugoslavia, Communist China, and Albania
                            failed to succumb to it—indeed, they actually accelerated their
                            anti-Soviet policies as a direct consequence of its use. Nonetheless,
                            the Soviets almost certainly consider it one of the major weapons in
                            their arsenal. The Eastern European states depend for close to half
                            their total trade on the Soviet Union, and most of them certainly
                            realize that their industrial exports have little demand in the
                            West.</p>
                        <p>20. Most of these countries are seeking to reduce this dependence on the
                            USSR. They are trying to improve the quality and the mix of their export
                            trade, attempting vigorously to expand exchanges with the West, and
                            seeking out Western credits with which to improve domestic performance.
                            It is not inconceivable that, with time and luck, they could materially
                            reduce their dependence on the USSR and at least develop a potential for
                            trade with other states should the need suddenly arise.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III. Country Survey: The Spectrum of Sovereignty</p>
                        <p>21. While for most purposes the countries of Eastern Europe should not be
                            considered as a whole, should be examined in the light of their
                            diversity, in one important way they may now be viewed in terms of their
                            collective impact. From the point of view of Moscow, and in terms of
                            their influence on Soviet policies, these states can be seen as an
                            autonomous political force. Increasingly over the past several years,
                            and with Rumania showing the way, the course of political action and the
                            direction of political pressure in this area now runs from East to West.
                            These <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0063"/>countries are gradually
                            chipping away at Soviet dominance, asserting individual national
                            interests, and turning increasingly to the West as an alternative to
                            Soviet dominance.</p>
                        <p>22. Nationalism is now a strong factor throughout the area, most of it
                            strongly laced with anti-Russianism, and it must appear to many of these
                            leaderships to be an attractive prelude or even alternative to genuine
                            liberalization. It is finely calculated to maximize popular support for
                            otherwise highly unpopular governments; by itself, liberalization
                            appears quite unable to do a comparable job. Indeed, unless its economy
                            is able to sustain fairly consistent and impressive rises in the
                            standard of living—as is nowhere the case in this area—the regime which
                            embarks on liberalization runs the risk of actually increasing popular
                            discontent by allowing its more vocal expression.</p>
                        <p>23. It may be that some of these regimes—Bulgaria comes immediately to
                            mind—are so compromised and conditioned by their history of abject
                            subservience to the Soviets, or so blinded by the myths of their
                            ideology, that they will not be able to introduce a policy designed to
                            appeal to nationalistic sentiments. But others will surely see the
                            benefits of such a course, especially in terms of their own interests
                            and positions of power, and will be strongly tempted to travel the
                            Rumanian road.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>51. It is not possible to predict the specifics of future change in
                            Eastern Europe. These will be the result of individual choice, the
                            consequence of events yet to come, the product of factors and movements
                            essentially unpredictable, and, of course, the policies and actions of
                            the great powers. But of this we are sure—there will be change, and it
                            may come faster than we had generally anticipated and in ways we do not
                            expect. We have learned from experience—from, for example, Albania and
                            Rumania—to be wary of generalizations about this area. As time goes by
                            and as the trend toward independence in Eastern Europe gathers momentum,
                            diversity will increase and chances for the unexpected may grow
                            apace.</p>
                        <p>52. The initiative of political movement in Eastern Europe now rests
                            largely with these states themselves, rather than with the USSR. Each of
                            these states, with the exception of East Germany, is led by a group of
                            men and a political institution which now depend for their very
                            existence primarily on domestic sources of strength and domestic
                            attitudes and traditions. In several states, communism is perhaps taking
                            firm root, but in a way quite unforeseen in both Moscow and the West. It
                            is a variety of <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0064"/>national
                            communism which has established itself in Rumania and bids fair to do so
                            elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>53. We would not expect these regimes to become national Communist in
                            character on similar schedules, in equal degree, or in identical form.
                            Common to them, however, would be full control over domestic policies
                            and a meaningful degree of independence in foreign affairs. Their
                            allegiance to Marxism-Leninism would probably vary but at least in some
                            this would be a question of public image rather than true adherence to
                            doctrine. Some might retain a fairly unified and disciplined one-party
                            structure; others, though operating through only one party, might see
                            the development of important and diverse political forces within a
                            Communist party framework and the gradual growth of extra-party and even
                            popular influences. Nowhere, however, would we anticipate the
                            development of a genuine multi-party system, though almost certainly
                            pressure for this would grow. In the last analysis, each regime would
                            determine for itself what in fact constituted “socialism” and each
                            regime would remain “communist” so long as it declared itself to be
                            so.</p>
                        <p>54. As its efforts to convert <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss> into
                            a Soviet-dominated supranational force would seem to testify, the USSR
                            is almost foredoomed to failure when it does seek to innovate and expand
                            its controls. Moreover, the failure of Soviet initiatives tends to
                            produce a chain reaction, for each instance of successful Eastern
                            European opposition contains within it the seeds of even stronger
                            resistance for the next round. The USSR thus is forced to choose between
                            making concessions, following more permissive policies, or finding
                            itself more and more in the position of a power seeking to restrain
                            change rather than trying, as it once did, to impose it. In a sense
                            then, each of these regimes can choose the time, the place, and the
                            issue with which to apply pressure on Moscow. And nothing now seems more
                            inevitable than a gradually increasing interest in and desire for
                            greater independence on the part of most or all of these countries. The
                            replacement of the present, aging leaderships with younger, more
                            vigorous, and probably less doctrinaire officials is much more likely to
                            hasten this process than to retard it.</p>
                        <p>55. It is thus possible, as it has been in the past, to discern the
                            general outlines of this trend and to ascertain its direction. The
                            movement is not of its own accord toward the West, nor does it appear
                            necessarily to be heading toward Westernized concepts of democracy.
                            Rather, these states are acting in what they conceive to be their own
                            national interests, and they look to the West principally in order to
                            strengthen precisely those interests. True, this in many instances has
                            the effect of moving them away from the East and in this manner toward
                            the West. It is also true that most of these states looked westward
                            before they were forced by Moscow to about face. And a few of these
                            countries, notably Czechoslovakia, to a lesser extent Hungary and
                            Poland, had at least some tradition of democracy <pb n="37"
                                xml:id="pg_37" facs="0065"/>before they were compelled to surrender
                            to communism. But, while they may move only partway toward the West and
                            its ideas, from the perspective of Moscow the trend is highly dangerous.
                            This was the great fear of Moscow during the Hungarian Revolution; it
                            was genuinely concerned that Hungary would rejoin the West of its own
                            accord, whether the West desired it or not, and, ultimately, it was this
                            fear that led Moscow to intervene militarily. The same concern could
                            bring about a repetition of that event.</p>
                        <p>56. For the most part we do not foresee crises in Eastern Europe. These
                            regimes are likely to move with relative caution, to test and probe for
                            Soviet reactions before adopting new policies of their own, and, in
                            general, to avoid acts which might provoke the Soviets into
                            intervention. But this does not mean that precipitous Soviet action can
                            be ruled out of the question. The Soviets could fear the overthrow of an
                            Eastern European regime, or its submission to non-Communist forces, and
                            intervene to forestall it. They could, in addition, badly misjudge a
                            given situation, see threats to their vital interests where in fact none
                            existed, or become overly frightened about specific events and move
                            accordingly. Or it is always possible that a change in the Soviet
                            leadership could lead to a determination to restore Soviet hegemony in
                            Eastern Europe through whatever means proved necessary. For their part,
                            the Eastern European regimes might provoke severe Soviet moves by
                            capitulating to strong popular pressures and pursuing nationalistic
                            policies overtly and virulently hostile to the USSR and Soviet
                            interests. They could also miscalculate Soviet responses to specific
                            moves and provoke Moscow without actually meaning to do so.</p>
                        <p>57. It may be that it is already too late to speak of the relations
                            between Moscow and the Eastern European states in terms of the formal
                            instruments of Soviet hegemony. The Cominform is long gone; <gloss
                                target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss> functions, but not well.</p>
                        <p>58. Concerning the Warsaw Pact, two distinct trends are visible. The USSR
                            has seen fit to provide these countries with at least the potential for
                            more independent military action. The Eastern Europeans have, in fact,
                            assumed greater control over their own forces, a trend consonant with
                            developments in the political sphere. On the other hand, the Soviets
                            seem to be placing greater reliance on the Eastern European forces in
                            the formulation of their military strategy. It may be that the Soviets
                            no longer look upon the Pact as an important means to ensure political
                            control but primarily as a more or less conventional military alliance,
                            dominated, of course, by the supplier of arms, Moscow. If so, it would
                            certainly accord with the Soviet effort to improve the military
                            capabilities of these forces.</p>
                        <p>59. In any case, the Rumanians seem to have cast a dubious eye on the
                            value of the Pact to Rumanian purposes, have publicly deplored all
                            military pacts as anachronistic, and have privately informed US
                            authorities <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0066"/>that Rumanian troops
                            will defend only Rumania. They have also privately indicated that, left
                            to their own devices, they would pull out of the Pact. It is probable
                            that the Rumanians are bent on reducing their role within this
                            organization to a purely formal level.</p>
                        <p>60. But these countries remain under firm, one-party Communist control,
                            as Hungary did not, and, in the last analysis, they can remain at least
                            nominal allies of the USSR so long as they remain avowedly Communist. It
                            is for the Soviet Union to decide whether this is enough. In the event
                            that one or more of these states severed even that one last tie,
                            military intervention would be the only avenue open to the USSR to
                            enforce its will on the defecting country. Whether this would then be
                            judged a feasible course of action, whether the gains in Eastern Europe
                            would balance the risks and losses elsewhere in the world, only Moscow
                            could decide. And Moscow is not good at solving this sort of
                            dilemma.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">B. Soviet Policy</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>61. Moscow has sought in fits and starts, and for the most part
                            ineffectually, to arrest the drive for independence in Eastern Europe.
                            For one thing, the USSR does not fully understand the emotional force of
                            nationalism and thus can frame no clear policy to combat it. For
                            another, the Soviets have themselves facilitated the process by a
                            general loosening of policies toward the area, aided and abetted by
                            their moves against China and toward the West. We believe that, unless
                            the Soviets are willing to resort to military intervention, the momentum
                            of this movement toward independence will gather force and become highly
                            contagious.</p>
                        <p>62. The USSR sees Eastern Europe as vital to its strategic needs. Not
                            only does it provide a forward area for defense and offense, it serves
                            generally as a buffer zone between the Soviet Union and West Germany and
                            the other “hostile” status of Western Europe. The USSR also sees in
                            Eastern Europe a vindication of Communist doctrine, a proof of the
                            inevitable advance of socialism; conversely, it would view the defection
                            of any of these states as a refutation of that doctrine. Finally, the
                            USSR sees Eastern Europe as an integral part of its empire, a source of
                            actual and potential economic, political, and military support.</p>
                        <p>63. All three of these concepts are, of course, subject to change. The
                            strategic consideration is perhaps the least susceptible to
                            modification, but even here the facts of the nuclear-missile age render
                            the concept considerably less valid than it once was. Nonetheless, long
                            after strategic factors make the area relatively useless for the defense
                            of the homeland, Soviet thinking is likely to reflect more or less
                            traditional military concepts of Eastern Europe's value to the USSR.</p>
                        <p>64. Greater change may take place in the area of doctrine. The evolution
                            set off by de-Stalinization, and further shaped by the Sino-Soviet
                            conflict, has already altered the concept of a monolithic bloc. As the
                            Eastern <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0067"/>Europeans increasingly
                            depart from Soviet practice, as Yugoslavia is welcomed to the club, and
                            as the Soviet definition of “socialism” is further diluted both by
                            domestic changes and by the inclusion of more and more countries, such
                            as the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, into the “progressive” camp,
                            the requirements of the doctrine for the individual Eastern European
                            states become vaguer and more permissive. What will constitute a loyal
                            member of the bloc in terms of ideology a decade hence can be but dimly
                            perceived.</p>
                        <p>65. Inevitably, this sort of ideological erosion will also have an effect
                            on the Soviet concept of empire. The dreams of a tightly knit organism
                            following a single economic plan, with national boundaries turning into
                            unimportant anachronisms, have surely faded. If this is indeed the way
                            in which the USSR's attitudes and policies toward Eastern Europe are
                            likely to evolve in time, it will be difficult to define the Bloc in the
                            usual way, i.e., as a Bloc. Organizations like <gloss target="#t_CEMA1"
                                >CEMA</gloss> and the Warsaw Pact might be retained only on the
                            basis of a genuine partnership and only to the extent that they served
                            some specifically worthwhile purpose, something comparable, for example,
                            to the European steel community. Or they might become moribund, be
                            scrapped, and then superseded either by a series of bilateral treaties
                            or by an amorphous regional pact of only symbolic import. Some of these
                            states might form various regional associations with each other and even
                            with non-Communist neighbors. Under all such arrangements as these, each
                            member state would be largely free to pursue its own interests at will,
                            presumably so long as these did not involve policies actively hostile
                            toward one another.</p>
                        <p>66. If the USSR were to recognize clearly the trends in Eastern Europe
                            and to initiate forward-looking policies which sought to encourage and
                            to influence the process, the formation of a harmonious Soviet-East
                            Europe alliance would be greatly eased. The history of their relations
                            to date, however, does not suggest that the Soviets are likely to do
                            this. The Soviets will find it hard to accept a loose confederation of
                            sovereign countries bound together in traditional ways of alliance and
                            cooperation. This strikes at the Russian sense of great-power status,
                            and herein lie numerous possibilities for ill timed Muscovite
                            heavy-handedness. They are apt to fight the problem as they have in the
                            past, hoping to halt or at least delay the process through a variety of
                            small measures and perhaps large threats, ultimately discovering that
                            they must give in with as much salvaged grace as possible. This, of
                            course, usually has the opposite effect from that intended; not only
                            does it incur the ill will of these countries, which does not surprise
                            Moscow, but it also frequently stimulates further efforts to increase
                            sovereignty, and to Moscow this apparently does come as something of a
                            shock.</p>
                        <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0068"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft">

                        </p>
                        <p>67. The Eastern European states are not enthusiastic supporters of many
                            facets of Soviet foreign policy. Except when internal exigencies require
                            it, for example, most of these regimes are reluctant to express
                            full-throated Communist hostility toward the West. On the contrary,
                            because of burgeoning hopes for expanded economic relations with the
                            advanced Western countries, the Eastern European countries would like to
                            improve their relations with the West. Rumania, Hungary, and
                            Czechoslovakia have made this intention quite clear in recent months. So
                            long as the USSR's own policy includes an element of détente, it will be
                            difficult for the Soviets to restrain Eastern European movement toward
                            the West. Should Moscow reverse itself, it could expect resistance on
                            the part of its allies, a factor to be taken into account in the
                            formation of Soviet policy.</p>
                        <p>68. In the Sino-Soviet dispute, the Eastern European states sympathize
                            with the Soviet doctrinal position and some of them, such as
                            Czechoslovakia and East Germany, have been quick to commit themselves
                            publicly to the Soviet side. But Poland has sought to soften the dispute
                            and has counseled the USSR to act cautiously, and Rumania has gone even
                            farther and publicly dissociated itself from the Soviet point of view.
                            In general, the Eastern European regimes have been given added leverage
                            with the USSR because of the dispute and, though none would favor a
                            Chinese victory, or even important Soviet concessions, they welcome the
                            increased maneuverability they have been granted by default and are
                            probably not anxious for a final settlement of the problem.</p>
                        <p>69. In yet another area of Soviet policy, the East European states are
                            important contributors to the Soviet bloc's program of economic and
                            military aid to underdeveloped nations, adding some $1.9 billion to the
                            Soviet total of $7.4 billion. Czechoslovakia and Poland play by far the
                            most important role—the Czechoslovak program is much larger per capita
                            than the Soviet—but the other countries also participate. At its
                            inception, these states had no choice but to carry out the Soviet will,
                            and they often were used to promote strictly Soviet interests. There are
                            signs, however, that the Eastern European aid programs now are being
                            managed in a way that is more consistent with national interests.
                            Recently, these states have participated only rarely in Soviet economic
                            programs, relying instead on bilateral arrangements, and have almost
                            stopped extending military aid.</p>
                        <p>70. The Eastern European states, except Yugoslavia, have few national
                            political interests in the underdeveloped countries, and they have far
                            less interest in expanding their economic relations with these countries
                            than with the industrial West. Moreover, there is widespread popular
                            resentment of the aid programs in Eastern Europe. Nevertheless, these
                            programs probably will continue, even in the absence of Soviet <pb
                                n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0069"/>domination, because some
                            prospective economic benefits are expected from them. By extending
                            credits on liberal terms the East European states gain access for their
                            manufactured goods to markets that might not otherwise be available and
                            to new sources of goods and raw materials. The main exception to this
                            general rule may be aid to Cuba, where some subsidies may be involved
                            and where prospects for repayment of credits are dubious.</p>
                        <p>71. Soviet policy toward West Germany may also be at issue between Moscow
                            and some Eastern European regimes. Despite their apprehension and
                            dislike of the Germans, the East Europeans are particularly anxious to
                            expand their economic relations with West Germany and see no good reason
                            why the unresolved question of Berlin should be imposed on them as a
                            hindrance to the development of closer ties. Indeed, the willingness of
                            some of these regimes to sign so-called Berlin clauses as a
                            pre-condition for trade agreements demonstrates their unwillingness to
                            allow the interests of East Germany to intrude. Given a continuation of
                            the West German policy of increasing its presence in Eastern Europe, and
                            of such arrangements as are now under negotiation between Bonn and
                            Warsaw for the establishment of joint industrial enterprises on Polish
                            soil, we consider the expansion of Eastern European-West German ties to
                            be almost certain, and we would expect hostility to diminish.</p>

                        <p>72. The removal of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> from
                            power destroyed one of the strongest surviving political links between
                            the USSR and the countries of Eastern Europe. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was careful to cultivate
                            good relations with all the Satellite leaders, replacing the iron will
                            and discipline (and contempt) of Stalin with personal force and
                            camaraderie, persuasion, and occasional threats. He developed
                            particularly close working relationships with both <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                >Gomulka</persName>, swallowed his dislike of <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> and cajoled him into
                            cooperation, kept the strings taut on <persName corresp="#p_ZT1"
                                >Zhivkov</persName> in Bulgaria, and in general treated the Eastern
                            European leaders as fellow politicians in the Bloc club. He even
                            introduced <persName corresp="#p_TJB1">Tito</persName> into
                            membership.</p>
                        <p>73. One result was the sour reaction of these leaders to his downfall.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NA1"
                                >Novotny</persName>, and even <persName corresp="#p_UW1"
                                >Ulbricht</persName> publicly indicated their displeasure by
                            praising <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> when it was
                            quite clearly the Soviet intention only to criticize him. Mainly, we
                            suppose, these leaders were concerned about reactions within their own
                            parties, but we do not discount some genuine attachment to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, approval of his policies,
                            and concern and uncertainty over those of the new leaders. In any case,
                            we know of no personal ties between the Eastern European leaders and
                            Khrushchev's successors, and we do not expect any single Soviet leader
                            to gain the stature <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            once enjoyed for some time to come.</p>
                        <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0070"/>
                        <p>74. It seems likely that most or all of these leaders will now take the
                            opportunity afforded by the new situation in the USSR to press their own
                            national interests and to make their voices heard in Moscow. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GDG1">Gheorghiu-Dej</persName> has already begun to
                            assert Rumania's interests more vigorously than ever and others will
                            probably follow suit. In any event, should Moscow seek to restore
                            tighter controls over these leaders, it is likely to meet with greater
                            resistance than ever. Only <persName corresp="#p_UW1"
                                >Ulbricht</persName> among them was in the top spot at the time of
                            Stalin's death; thus the others have either worked successfully for
                            their own autonomy and are by now accustomed to running the affairs of
                            their own parties, or have worked only in an atmosphere of relative
                            Soviet permissiveness. They are surely aware that the new Soviet leaders
                            have no more means at their disposal—and probably fewer—for enforcing
                            Eastern European conformity than <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had.</p>
                        <p>75. They are also acutely sensitive to the general political scene in
                            Moscow and are almost certainly convinced that the present collective
                            arrangement is inherently unstable. They will probably be reluctant to
                            support one faction or the other until the outcome of such instability
                            becomes clear, and they will be equally averse to committing themselves
                            to policy except in a very general way. Some in Eastern Europe—probably
                            the weaker elements—may identify themselves with one Soviet faction or
                            the other and seek political support therefrom, but the chances of this
                            do not seem as great as they once were, for example, in Hungary where
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nagy</persName> clearly identified
                            himself with Malenkov, Rakosi with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>. For their part, the Soviets, so long as they
                            remain locked in a struggle for power, are unlikely to formulate new and
                            coherent policies for the area, and disputes on this issue are likely to
                            arise. Decisions needed in a crisis may thus be hard to obtain. As with
                            foreign policies in general, Soviet interests in Eastern Europe might be
                            better served by one-man leadership.</p>
                        <p>76. Of equal import is the question just where and when the USSR can now
                            count on these states for support. Matters have already reached the
                            stage where Moscow cannot assume in advance that its particular policies
                            will receive automatic approval from Eastern Europe; in order to be
                            sure, the Soviets must sound out these governments in advance. They must
                            wheedle and cajole in instances where support is withheld, and in cases
                            where even this fails, they must either alter or abandon their tack or
                            proceed alone. This is particularly true in issues related to the
                            Sino-Soviet dispute, where Rumania has declared its full neutrality and
                            other states, most notably Poland, have exhibited a reluctance to adopt
                            the Soviet line. But to a lesser degree it also applies to Soviet policy
                            toward the West; the President's state of the union message, for
                            example, was blistered in Moscow but praised in some East European
                            capitals. We think the trend is clear: the East European states are no
                            longer willing to adopt as their <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0071"
                            />own whatever foreign policies the USSR sees fit to advance. Before
                            giving their full support, most of these states seem to wish to subject
                            such policies to critical examination in the light of their own
                            burgeoning national interests.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Policy Considerations</p>
                        <p>We believe that the quiet revolution now in progress in the East European
                            countries will continue and gather momentum in the years <pb n="44"
                                xml:id="pg_44" facs="0072"/>ahead. The current changes in East
                            Europe are characterized by four important features varying in degree
                            from one country to another: (1) internal liberalization; (2)
                            establishment of a certain degree of national independence from Soviet
                            control; (3) pragmatic innovations designed to cope with pressing
                            economic problems; and (4) progress in reassociation with the West.</p>
                        <p>Our basic purpose in building bridges to East Europe is to facilitate and
                            sustain these changes. We seek thereby progress toward the realization
                            of our ultimate objective in East Europe, that is: the establishment of
                            conditions under which the people of each country may determine its own
                            society; and where each country may enjoy national independence,
                            security, and a normal relationship with all other countries. This will
                            mean the final dismantling of the Iron Curtain and the free association
                            of East Europe and the West. It will entail the establishment of a
                            viable relationship between the East European countries and the Soviet
                            Union consistent with the security of both.</p>
                        <p>To weave the fabric of reassociation with East Europe is to lower
                            barriers, strengthen ties and broaden relations with the countries of
                            that area. We seek to promote and influence the evolution of Communism
                            in the area and to obtain the agreement and positive cooperation of
                            Communist governments in spheres of mutual interest.</p>
                        <p>We must focus and rearticulate our policy in keeping with the developing
                            East European situation. We must also closely relate our moves in East
                            Europe to the solution of the German problem and the achievement of a
                            durable relationship with the Soviet Union. Our policies for achieving
                            West European unity, East European evolution and secure peace with the
                            Soviet Union must move forward together.</p>

                        <p>The program includes actions that can be taken now as well as measures
                            that will put us in a better position to take advantage of opportunities
                            as they emerge in the various countries of East Europe. Timing and

                                <p>We can support such initiatives by entering into commercial
                                    agreements with individual European Communist countries on the
                                    basis of a mutual exchange of benefits. Such agreements need not
                                    be limited to trade. They should be used as an opportunity to
                                    resolve outstanding problems in matters concerning trade, such
                                    as: the protection of industrial property (Tab B), settlement of
                                    commercial disputes, and expansion of trade and tourism
                                    opportunities. Such agreements could also be related to the
                                    settlement of financial claims and consular problems. They can
                                    be used as a means of bringing US relations with an individual
                                    country under regular review and consultation procedures.</p>
                                <p>We can move in this direction through bilateral negotiation on
                                    the pattern of the Rumanian talks in 1964. For this purpose, we
                                    must be prepared to liberalize our export licensing practices
                                    and to guarantee commercial credits as part of the process of
                                    broadening relations with an individual country.</p>
                                <p>If we are to expand trade with these countries on a sound basis
                                    and maintain forward momentum in our relations with them, it
                                    will be necessary for the US to grant most-favored-nation tariff
                                    treatment where the situation warrants.</p>

                                    declared that the West should propose “common projects” to the

                        <p>We should make more active use of specialized multilateral organizations
                            to influence the evolution of East European countries and to enlarge the
                            area of peaceful engagement between them and the West. Individual East
                            European countries are becoming increasingly interested in full
                            membership, partial membership, or observer status in multilateral

                            likely to seek various types of links with the supranational European
                            Communities.</p>
                        <p>We should seek to utilize this interest, examining each opportunity on a
                            case-by-case basis and responding appropriately to specific overtures
                            from East European countries. We must balance the risk that entry of
                            East European countries could dilute the operational effectiveness of
                            the organization concerned against the gain in advancing our goal of
                            reassociation of the East European countries with the West.</p>

                                    <p>We should decide, as soon as prospects for an East-West Trade

                                        putting our economic relations with Poland on a purely
                                        commercial basis, expand our trade, and broaden our cultural

                                    <p>Our proposals are principally concerned with measures to
                                        follow up and consolidate the results of the negotiations of
                                        1964 with the Rumanians, which significantly extended
                                        Rumanian relations with the US and helped to enlarge the
                                        basis of Rumanian independence. If we are to continue this
                                        forward movement it will be necessary soon to be able to
                                        accord Rumania most-favored-nation tariff treatment.</p>

                            <item>For years little more than a paper organization, the Warsaw Pact
                                has become an important element in Soviet European policy and
                                military planning. In the early 1960s, the USSR moved to establish a
                                new military relationship with the countries of Eastern Europe, to
                                improve their military capabilities and to tighten the Pact as a
                                military organization. Of late, the East European countries have
                                manifested in varying degrees an increasing independence of the USSR
                                in their political and economic policies. The loosening of Soviet
                                controls in Eastern Europe has increased the importance of the Pact
                                to the USSR as an institutional tie. For their part the East
                                European countries see the Pact as an assurance that the Soviets
                                will continue to underwrite their regimes and to safeguard existing
                                boundaries. (Paras. 1–8)</item>

                            <item>Improvements over the past five years have made East European
                                military forces a more useful adjunct to Soviet military power. We
                                estimate that 35 of the 63 East European line divisions, varying
                                considerably in quality, could be deployed within a few days. East
                                European air defense systems are coordinated with each other and
                                with the Soviet air defense organization. With 125 SAM sites and
                                2,400 fighter aircraft these <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0081"
                                />systems afford a fair defense throughout the area. While we
                                believe that the Soviets will not give East European forces nuclear
                                weapons in peacetime, in the event of war these weapons would
                                probably be made available under strict Soviet control. (Paras. 23,
                                29, 31–34)</item>
                            <label>C.</label>
                            <item>The Soviets will probably continue their efforts to strengthen the
                                Warsaw Pact. The growing independence of Eastern Europe, however,
                                will make it difficult to obtain agreement on specific courses of
                                action. Changes in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> will
                                influence developments in the Warsaw alliance; in particular, any
                                substantial increase in the role of West Germany would strengthen
                                the special relationship among East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia,
                                and the USSR. Rumania will probably seek to minimize its
                                participation in the Pact, but we do not believe that it will
                                attempt formally to withdraw. (Paras. 43–45)</item>

                            <item>In a crisis situation threatening general war, we believe that the
                                East European regimes would attempt to exert a moderating influence
                                on Soviet policy. If the USSR ordered mobilization, their responses
                                would probably differ, ranging from immediate compliance by the East
                                Germans to recalcitrance on the part of the Rumanians. In the event
                                of armed conflict, we believe that the East European armed forces
                                could be relied upon to take part, at least initially, in military
                                operations in conjunction with Soviet forces. (Paras. 9–11)</item>

                                Gronouski</persName>, our Ambassador-Designate to Poland, inquired
                            about the attitude of the Defense Department regarding U.S. trade with
                            Eastern European countries. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> stated that the Defense Department completely
                            favored such trade.</p>
                        <p>Noting that in the past most of such trade with Poland had been in
                            agricultural products, the Postmaster General asked whether the attitude
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had expressed
                            also extended to industrial items, including those of heavy-industry

                            that it did and indicated that the only exception would be highly

                                years and which would appear to indicate a desire on their part to
                                move nearer to the West. Noting that the Albanians appear not to
                                dare take the plunge and seem to be afraid of being repulsed by the
                                West, <persName>Toncic</persName> asked the Secretary if he expected
                                any change, be it ever so slight, in the Albanian attitude, and
                                wished to know if Austria should respond.</item>

                            <item>The Secretary stated that the U.S. has little information on the
                                subject except for impressions gained by Albania's neighbors. The
                                Secretary speculated, however, that the Albanians may be becoming
                                restless under the monopoly of the Communist Chinese. The Secretary
                                indicated that while it would be a great mistake for the U.S. to try
                                to probe the intentions of the Albanians, it would be constructive
                                and helpful for the Austrians to do so and, he concluded, “You might
                                meet with a response.”</item>

                        <p>The future of Radio Free Europe has been under consideration for several
                            years. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> convened a
                            special study group in 1966 which consisted of Professor <persName

                                <persName>William Griffith</persName> of MIT, <persName>Richard
                                Salant</persName> of CBS, and the current Ambassador to Switzerland,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJS1">John S. Hayes</persName>. This paper,
                            among other tasks, reviewed the work of Radio Free Europe and Radio
                            Liberty and found that the value of these assets had not diminished and
                            would continue to have a role in an era beyond the cold war. This
                            opinion was unanimous.</p>
                        <p>The matter became more critical after the <persName>Katzenbach</persName>
                            Committee was forced to reach some decisions regarding covert support to
                            various U.S. voluntary educational, philanthropic and cultural
                            endeavours. This committee and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                                >Rusk</persName> recommended that the 303 Committee examine this
                            problem because of its unique complexities. Since that time, Messrs.

                                >Nitze</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>,

                            <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Schultze</persName>, have given considerable
                            time to looking at this problem from all angles.</p>
                        <p>Some nine possible solutions were examined; these included the status
                            quo, conversion from non-profit to profit-making corporations,
                            reincorporation abroad, relocation abroad, support by a public private
                            mechanism, support from a public private mechanism specifically designed
                            to foster private international broadcasting and other communications,
                            overt funding by <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> (or another
                            agency of the Executive Branch), transfer to <gloss target="#t_VOA1"
                                >VOA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>, and termination.
                            All were eliminated in 303 discussions except for the three
                            possibilities: <list>

                        <p>It was these three approaches that were tackled on a priority basis by
                                <persName>William Trueheart</persName> of State and an inter-agency
                            group. The conclusion reached in this solid study was that there were
                            really but two realistic choices: either continuation as now constituted
                            or termination. Some basic conclusions from this report are quoted:

                                    in Eastern Europe in promoting and encouraging internal
                                    pressures for reform and political liberalization
                                    (de-Stalinization) and for the attenuation of Soviet influence
                                    and control. Further, we believe that the broadcasts are not
                                    incompatible with a policy of bridge-building; indeed,
                                    meaningful improvement in East-West relations is probably
                                    dependent in the long run on the kind of internal changes which

                                    which effective programming of the <gloss target="#t_RFE1"

                                <p>“The case for continuing <gloss target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss> is
                                    less clear because it is impossible to obtain relatively
                                    reliable data, such as we have for <gloss target="#t_RFE1"
                                        >RFE</gloss>, on the size and make-up of the <gloss

                                    >RL</gloss>'s capability of substantial importance. The Soviet
                                    jamming effort (at least 160 jamming centers) itself attests to
                                    the effectiveness, at least potentially, of the broadcasts and
                                    argues against according the windfall which termination would

                            'enriched country-oriented <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>' was
                            through inquiries to our missions in target countries. In a relevant
                            comment from Embassy Moscow, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1"
                                >Thompson</persName> concluded that status quo should be maintained
                            for the time being and that 'public disclosure (of U.S. Government
                            support) would be unfortunate but believe risk must be taken.'</p>
                        <p>“The third approach to the 'enriched <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>'
                            alternative was technical … The subgroup report brings out that 'the
                            entire shortwave system of the <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> is
                            being used at maximum capacity for broadcasting to the European area at

                        <p>“A fourth consideration is that enrichment of <gloss target="#t_VOA1"
                                >VOA</gloss> programs would also require <gloss target="#t_VOA1"

                        <p>“More basic than any of the foregoing is the question whether <gloss

                            evolved over the years, should be changed—quite apart from the
                            practicality of doing so. The Study Group thought this question went
                            well beyond its mandate.</p>
                        <p>“Apart from the question of the 'enriched, country-oriented <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>', the BOB dissent boils down to a
                            questioning of the majority view on the public reaction to acknowledging
                            U.S. Government support and Congressional reaction to continued <gloss

                            judgment; the latter can only be assessed by consultation with the
                            Congress—which the Study Group assumed would be the first order of

                            <item>At my visit with each of these five individuals, I explained in

                                financing these radios. I made it clear that a public relations
                                problem still exists in terms of how the Administration explains the

                                tactical approach to the press. I carefully underlined that I was
                                there on my own since you wanted it clearly understood that you did
                                not want to make a personal appeal for the money involved nor did
                                you feel that you should be asked to plead for these radios as
                                against other projects which you felt to be more essential. It was
                                my distinct impression that each individual understood the terms of
                                the discussion quite clearly.</item>

                            <item>Congressman Mahon reacted to my presentation by saying that he had
                                felt it had been a mistake to include the radios in the

                                preferred to have them continue to operate as they had in the past.
                                He recognized the public relations problems but stated that it did
                                not concern him unduly even if there were some criticism. (At this
                                point, he made a disparaging reference to the influence of <hi

                                Reston.”) He then remarked that he thought the radios should be

                                funds. He pointed out, however, <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66"

                            <item>Representative Bow told me that he thought the radios were doing a
                                good job and that they should be continued. He promised to help
                                provide the money. In the course of our conversation, he pointed out
                                that he was on the Appropriations Subcommittee which deals with
                                    <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> and that in his opinion it
                                would make no sense to try to meld Radio Free Europe and/or Radio
                                Liberty into the Voice of America organization. He indicated that he
                                clearly understood the difference in the program content of the
                                Voice of America on the one hand and the two “private” radios on the
                                other. He concluded by opining that this was no time in history to
                                reduce our efforts to bring about change behind the Iron
                                Curtain.</item>

                            <item>Representative Lipscomb said that he was in favor of the radios
                                and did not want to see them terminated. He volunteered to do what
                                he could to have the money appropriated and asked a few questions
                                about the amounts involved and how they were allocated. He accepted
                                the fact that some admission of government support might have to be
                                made. He stated that this would present “a tricky problem” in
                                dealing with the press but did not anticipate widespread newspaper
                                criticism.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>Senator Russell expressed his support of the radios and said that
                                he thought they ought to be continued at least for a time. He
                                repeated what he has said before that he never could understand what
                                all the ruckus had been about. He pointed out that criticism over
                                these subsidies had died out quickly after the initial flurry last
                                winter. He indicated his willingness to help secure the money
                                involved and asked me to go see Senator Young and put the matter to
                                him. He authorized me to tell Senator Young that he favored
                                continuing the radios.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>When I met with Senator Young, I told him that Senator Russell had
                                asked me to see him, but I did not attempt to influence his decision
                                by telling him in advance what Senator Russell's position was. He
                                did not even inquire. He simply stated that he thought the radios
                                should continue to operate and that he would do what he could to
                                help as far as appropriations are concerned. He expressed the
                                opinion that the state of the world being what it was, no useful
                                efforts to deal with Communism or Communist ideology should be
                                reduced. He voiced concern that possibly not enough was being done
                                in this area.</item>

                        </list>
                        <p>At the staff meeting on Wednesday, we talked about the relationship
                            between political stability in Czechoslovakia, Poland and East Germany
                            and the success or failure of reform efforts. You pointed out the
                            crucial role of management incentive and I remarked that the most
                            notable recent step was the Hungarian reform which took effect at the
                            start of this year. Yugoslavia, of course, remains out in front.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps you would like a bit more information: Rank order, from a market
                            economy at one end to Stalinist planning at the other, might now be the
                            following: Yugoslavia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Poland, East
                            Germany, the Soviet Union, Romania, and finally Albania.</p>
                        <p>In <hi rend="italic">Yugoslavia</hi> they are moving toward free
                            convertibility and share capital. By a system of investment through
                            contract, firms can even use their profits to buy into other firms. Some
                            Yugoslav academicians even advocate factory managers having shares, and
                            there is talk of a stock exchange.</p>
                        <p>The present period of transition has been painful. The government's
                            policies have been classically deflationary and economic growth has
                            radically fallen off. There are estimates that urban unemployment is as
                            much as 15 percent.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hungarians</hi> have an inherent advantage, in not
                            having set up an intermediate network of trusts, cartels or production
                            associations between the ministries and the individual firms (as is the
                            case in most of the other countries in Eastern Europe). In their latest
                            move they have done away with planning for each enterprise. The
                            manager's salary and bonus do depend on his ability to find customers
                            and satisfy them. If he does not show a profit at all, he pays back a
                            quarter of his base salary.</p>
                        <p>The Hungarians plan a phased transition from a three-tier pricing system
                            to the virtual abolition of price controls. They plan increased reliance
                            for investment on retained profits (from about 25 percent in 1968 to a
                            larger percentage in each coming year). Another quarter of investment is
                            to be financed with bank credits at 7 to 8 percent. Increasing number of
                            firms will have the right to engage directly in the import and <pb
                                n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0096"/>export trade, with foreign
                            currency controlled by duties and surcharges rather than governmental
                            allocation. Apparently at least part of the Hungarians' motive is to
                            qualify for the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In <hi rend="italic">Czechoslovakia</hi>, economic reform has been
                            hindered by the almost Stalinist conservatism of <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA1">Novotny</persName> and his friends. Tight foreign
                            exchange, continuing scarcities, constant Party interference and the
                            continued incumbency of managers from the earlier era have all served to
                            slow reform. There is no doubt that this was an important element in the
                            recent leadership crisis. Partly because of the genuine socialist
                            tradition in Czechoslovakia, salaries paid managers are much lower as
                            compared with workers' salaries than in other countries (e.g. East
                            Germany). The manager can increase his earnings by about one-third if he
                            maximizes profits, sales and exports.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Poland</hi> is still benefiting from 1956 (including,
                            of course, the de-collectivization of agriculture). There is quite a bit
                            of private trade, and more of the new breed of men than in
                            Czechoslovakia. Quite apart from Oscar Lange, the Poles have some of the
                            best economists of Eastern Europe.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">East Germany</hi>'s economy benefited for years from
                            the open border with the West. Even now private firms, averaging about
                            25 employees, produce about 5 percent of gross output. Mixed
                            private/public enterprises produce another 10 percent.</p>
                        <p>For a few general observations, plans for economic liberalization tend to
                            run afoul of Party control, scarcities, foreign exchange limitations,
                            etc. As for the Party, I am sure not a few big wigs and old aparatchiki
                            have wondered what the Party does if it doesn't run the economy. Only in
                            Yugoslavia is the manager not hired or fired by the Party/Government. So
                            far, only in Yugoslavia is it the factory manager who has the dinars
                            really free to buy another blast furnace. However, Hungary will be
                            moving in that direction if her most recent reform is really carried
                            out.</p>
                        <p>One last word. You are probably familiar with the story told by the Czech
                            economist, Sik, which goes as follows: Prague was having worse and worse
                            trouble with traffic congestion and remembered that the British seem to
                            handle things better in London. So they sent a delegation. The
                            delegation reported that the British did seem to handle things better,
                            and the most remarkable difference was that they drove on the left. So
                            the Czech Government decided to shift sides; but, being cautious, they
                            felt they should not take too radical a move—so they decreed that
                            taxicabs drive on the left.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> opened the meeting
                            by observing that the Eastern European societies had, in one sense, the
                            opposite problem from our own. Our tradition has been individual rights,
                            and we have recently had to concern ourselves with collective problems.
                            The Communist societies depart from the collective view and are only
                            recently facing the problem of the individual. This produces a pull of
                            attraction to the West.</p>
                        <p>A second tie to the West is provided by the desire of Eastern European
                            intellectuals to pursue professional contacts with their Western
                            colleagues. A third tie is the desire of the Eastern European states to
                            assert their independence against the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> warned against the
                            danger that the East Germans might react to the changes going on in
                            Czechoslovakia and elsewhere by provoking additional tensions with the
                            West. The Secretary said he had Berlin particularly in mind, and
                            mentioned the recent problems of travel and Bundestag meetings. So far
                            as U.S. policy is concerned, the Secretary thought we were right in
                            playing the Eastern European question in low key. We should maintain our
                            public posture of non-intervention. The Secretary said we should bear in
                            mind the classic distinction between rape and seduction.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> expressed regret
                            that so many of our policy tools had been taken or withheld by the
                            Congress. In particular, it is a pity the East-West Trade bill was not
                            passed earlier. A drive to pass the East-West Trade bill now might be a
                            mistake.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that, because
                            of circumstances and policy, the Western Europeans may have to be out in
                            front in efforts to exploit Eastern European developments. However, we
                            have opportunities in the fields of trade and cultural contacts. The
                            Secretary went on to mention that he had just sent over a package on the
                            Romanians' desire to purchase a heavy water plant, with his
                            recommendation that the President approve it.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Deputy Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BCE1"
                                >Bohlen</persName> if he had anything to add. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> observed that the Communist
                            parties in Eastern Europe have usurped an all-encompassing role and this
                            has <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0098"/>had a stifling effect on
                            Eastern European societies. The original Marxist idea was that the
                            parties should exert ideological leadership. They have become both the
                            keeper and prisoner of ideology, and thereby increasingly ineffective in
                            leading these societies forward. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE1"
                                >Bohlen</persName> expressed concern that Czech developments go too
                            far, and provoke a Soviet reaction. He seconded the Secretary's advocacy
                            of quiet diplomacy.</p>
                        <p>The President, noting that he was making a brief digression, asked
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> why he thought
                            DeGaulle made his recent gesture to Hanoi. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> said DeGaulle had tipped his hat
                            to the President's acts of renunciation on March 31,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d20fn2">For text of the President's statement, see <hi

                            and probably felt he needed to redress the balance in Hanoi's direction.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> said DeGaulle's
                            general attitude has not changed, and we can expect continued
                            obstruction and hostility on gold, British entry into the Common Market
                            and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1"
                                >Fowler</persName> if he had any observations on the gold question
                            and Eastern Europe. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1"
                                >Fowler</persName> said the Yugoslavs were cooperating with us, and
                            the Soviets were not playing the market to our disadvantage. The Red
                            Chinese, on the other hand, were heavy takers.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> briefly discussed
                            the possibility that the Eastern European countries might seek
                            membership in the Bank and Fund. He noted Yugoslavia's creditable role
                            and recent feelers from Czechoslovakia and Hungary. While noting these
                            were constructive developments, he warned that we would have to be
                            careful that membership in international institutions did not enhance
                            the Communist countries' ability to penetrate and influence the free
                            world. He suggested we might think about using the Eastern European
                            countries' interest in the Bank and Fund as a way to encourage them to
                            reduce military aid to the developing world and loosen economic
                            coordination with Moscow.</p>
                        <p>The discussion shifted to Soviet interest in regional development banks.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said the Soviets
                            had hinted they might do something in connection with the Asian
                            Development Bank, but nothing had come of this. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> noted that we should be careful
                            to observe international strictures on credit (the Berne limits).</p>
                        <p>The President asked what added steps in our Eastern European policy we
                            can take without having to go to the Congress. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> observed that the recent set of
                            restrictive amendments (Findley, Belcher, etc.) hampered us
                            considerably. Nevertheless there are things we can do. For example, a
                            Bulgarian Trade Delegation is coming shortly, and the <pb n="71"
                                xml:id="pg_71" facs="0099"/>Secretary himself participated in the
                            Bulgarians' efforts to promote the sale of wines.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we should look again at the Czech gold question, as we
                            ought to try to resolve it. He added that the Czechs were offering us
                            something like $2 million on a $72 million claim. (Actually the U.S.
                            Government has already distributed $9 million to claimants from a $17
                            million steel mill which the Czechs once purchased and did not get
                            delivery on.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> mentioned our
                            negotiations for a consular convention with Hungary and Poland, and the
                            possibility of revising our visa forms for tourists, to accommodate
                            Eastern European sensitivities.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> raised the
                            question of <gloss target="#t_COMECON1">Comecon</gloss>, and Soviet
                            insistence that the Eastern European countries import raw materials from
                            the Soviet Union at inflated prices. He said this anomaly should present
                            us with opportunities under <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480. (Use
                            of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 would require legislation.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said we might take a
                            look at revising <gloss target="#t_COMECON1">Comecon</gloss> controls to
                            allow Eastern European scientists who study here, with our high-quality
                            equipment, to bring that equipment home for their own use. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> noted that the
                            Secretary was probably referring more to U.S. export controls than to
                            Comecon.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President noted the usefulness of trade fairs. He said he
                            thought we didn't do as well as we should with these opportunities.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> observed that our
                            funds were limited, and suggested that Commerce's view would be useful
                            in this regard. The President added: “So would Rooney's views.”</p>
                        <p>The President asked the Secretary of Defense if he had any comment.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> observed that
                            nationalism was spreading like a virus. He raised the question whether
                            the Soviet Union would consider using force in Eastern Europe and
                            suggested some contingency planning would be useful. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> said that the Soviets
                            would be reluctant to resort to direct military intervention on the
                            Hungarian pattern, and had, in fact, refrained from doing so against
                            Romania.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Helms</persName> observed that
                            Czechoslovakia's move towards independence had started as a result of
                            economics. Dependence on the Soviet Union had produced a degradation of
                            the Czech economy, which led to resentment throughout that society.</p>
                        <p>The President thanked the participants.</p>

                            Union consider it necessary to intervene to protect its interests in
                            Eastern Europe. At Tab A is a discussion of the contingency involving
                            Soviet military intervention. A discussion of possible Soviet economic
                            sanctions on one or several Eastern European countries is at Tab B.</p>
                        <p>Both papers concur in the necessity of approaching with discretion these
                            contingencies, as well as the actual situation in Eastern Europe. On the
                            other hand, there are steps we can and should take both to clear the
                            deck in anticipation of the above contingencies, and, given the present
                            circumstances, to seek to expand our economic ties with Eastern Europe,
                            particularly Czechoslovakia and Romania.</p>

                                    authority—since the events of 1956. In many ways, the Soviet
                                    Union faces even greater problems than it did then.</item>

                                <item>On the basis of current estimates, it is unlikely that the
                                    USSR will intervene militarily to reestablish its authority in
                                    one or another country in the area. There are, however,
                                    unpredictable elements. The present situation—particularly the
                                    reformist revolution in Czechoslovakia and the deterioration of
                                    Romanian-Soviet relations—is progressing, not ebbing. Moreover,
                                    the volatile developments in individual countries interact upon
                                    one another, and could have side-effects on other, presently
                                    stable, regimes in Eastern Europe. No one can say with assurance
                                    what the end result will be. It is possible, under circumstances
                                    not now expected, that the Soviet Union would feel compelled to
                                    intervene militarily in Czechoslovakia or even Romania;
                                    intervention in Poland or the now quiescent <gloss

                                <item>Given the present set of circumstances and expectations, the
                                    US and its Allies should assume as axiomatic that we wish to
                                    avoid a Soviet military intervention. At the same time, we
                                    should carry forward our existing policy, that of bridge
                                    building, by which we seek to normalize and expand our relations
                                    with Czechoslovakia, Romania, and other countries of Eastern
                                    Europe in the field of trade, cultural and scientific exchanges,
                                    ideas and tourism, to the maximum extent possible within
                                    existing limitations. By continuing this policy, we will be
                                    doing all within the means given to us to encourage further the
                                    constructive developments that have been taking place. The
                                    efforts should be made discreetly, without provocative public
                                    comments by the US Government or its information media. We
                                    should also be careful not to arouse unrealistic expectations
                                    concerning the degree of support which the US may be willing or
                                    able to provide these countries.</item>

                                    guidelines provide (a) that there be no intervention across the

                                    principal aim would be to avoid any deliberate or spontaneous
                                    military involvement by the US and its Allies, save to preserve
                                    order on the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> side of the
                                    border. Diplomatic action and public statements would be
                                    designed to mitigate, if possible, the effect of the Soviet
                                    intervention on the country concerned, and to confine if
                                    possible, the adverse impact of the action on other Eastern
                                    European countries. A central element of our public posture
                                    would be to demand the cessation of Soviet military
                                    intervention, though it would hardly be expected that Moscow
                                    would heed this call. The UN would presumably be the central

                            <p>The Soviet military intervention in Czechoslovakia should thus be
                                understood as a rational act of an orthodox majority which decided
                                that it was necessary to undertake limited risks and to assume
                                certain political costs in order to prevent the further
                                disintegration of the communist order in Eastern Europe and to
                                ensure the preservation of the existing balance of forces in Europe
                                as a whole. It should not be seen as the first in a succession of
                                reckless moves by the USSR which could ultimately engage <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces. The Soviets, we believe,
                                will continue to avoid moves risking serious confrontation with the
                                West so long as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> maintains its

                            <p>Nevertheless, the instinct and determination to nail down the status
                                quo has a dynamism of its own and could lead to further repressive
                                measures and actions in Eastern Europe. Yakubovskiy's tour to East
                                European capitals is reportedly motivated by an attempt to
                                strengthen Warsaw Pact defenses. Parallel moves to tighten economic
                                links within the framework of <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss>
                                may also be underway. Such moves beg the question of how far the
                                Soviet Union intends to go to impose its brand of orthodoxy in the
                                Warsaw Pact camp and to protect what the Soviet Union determines to
                                be its vital interests. Even now Romania feels threatened despite
                                the fact that it, unlike Czechoslovakia, has a party which is in
                                absolute control and a frontier which does not border on
                                “revanchist” West Germany. Similarly, Yugoslavia, even though it is
                                not and has never been a member of the Warsaw Pact, is uncertain
                                enough of Soviet intentions to believe that a Soviet military move
                                against it is possible. Despite these fears, there is as yet no hard
                                evidence to suggest that the Soviet Union intends to intervene
                                militarily in these two countries. <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82"
                                    facs="0110"/>The danger of intervention would appear to increase
                                if the Soviets, for example, felt it necessary to impose a harsh
                                occupation regime in Czechoslovakia. Such an act would suggest that
                                a hard-line majority was willing to escalate its military actions to
                                stamp out heresy and would foreshadow increased impatience with
                                “deviationism” in Romania, especially in the foreign policy arena,
                                and critical, polemical attacks from the side of Yugoslavia. Moves
                                against Romania and Yugoslavia would further pose the question
                                whether the Soviet Union would consider violating Austrian
                                neutrality for one reason or another to protect and advance its
                                interests in Central Europe. Should such a chain of events take
                                place, dangerous actions against Berlin could not be excluded,
                                although in this instance the Soviets would have to consider more
                                than in the other cases the likelihood of a Soviet military
                                confrontation with the US and its allies.</p>

                            <p>In the foregoing cases, i.e., Romania, Yugoslavia, Austria and
                                    Berlin,<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> faces a range of
                                challenges to the security and vital interests of its member
                                countries. Although we would wish to deter a Soviet move against
                                Romania, for example, the fact is that an invasion and occupation of
                                that country would not seriously affect the vital interests of
                                    <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or result in a significant
                                shift in the strategic balance between <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> and Warsaw Pact forces. It could be argued that
                                invasion of Romania might weaken the Warsaw Pact war potential since
                                additional Soviet forces would be required to neutralize the
                                Romanian divisions—as in Czechoslovakia. Yugoslavia would be of a
                                totally different dimension, and the challenge at the far end of the
                                spectrum, Berlin, would be much more acute and require an entirely
                                different series of political and military responses.</p>
                            <p>In each case, however, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                countries face two problems. The first is how best to combine
                                political, psychological, economic and military moves to deter
                                aggressive actions by the Soviets and their allies. Thus in the case
                                of Yugoslavia, political assurances must be matched by higher and
                                more visible stages of alert and action by <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> than in the case of Romania. This suggests that
                                some <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> actions included in the
                                Romanian contingency papers would be more credible if incorporated
                                in contingency plans for Yugoslavia. The second question posed in
                                each case is what action <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                should actually take in the event an invasion occurs or Berlin is
                                physically threatened.</p>
                            <p>The attached papers discuss these issues and policy questions in
                                detail and provide a basis for revising and fleshing out the
                                contingency arrangements now incorporated in the general Romanian
                                package.</p>

                                always possible, appears less likely than it did a month ago.
                                Although <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the US have no
                                security commitments vis-á-vis Romania, an invasion by the Soviet
                                Union would be a matter of concern to the West. It would signify
                                further Soviet willingness to resort to military force in
                                international affairs. Such a move would also suggest an increased
                                numerical strength in combat-ready Warsaw Pact forces and pose an
                                increased threat to Yugoslavia where <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> strategic interests are more directly concerned.

                                counter-intervention in Romania is unlikely since it could be the

                                and US efforts should therefore focus primarily on political
                                actions. Consideration would, however, have to be given to
                                assistance of some kind should the Romanians resist. Every possible
                                pressure would have to be brought to bear to forestall further
                                military aggression and threats to European security.</p>

                                our relations with the USSR and Eastern Europe. The gradual

                                            prove impracticable. The decision as to whether and how
                                            to grant economic assistance would depend on type,
                                            terms, need, and availability (reserves and pipeline).

                                            temporarily closed to Romanian merchandise.
                                            Interestingly, the Romanians have not approached us. If

                            <p>Summary: The immediate possibility of a Soviet invasion of Yugoslavia
                                is sharply limited. Our concern is based on the threat posed to the
                                    <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area. We are also
                                interested in preserving Yugoslavia's independent and relatively
                                liberal image. If an invasion materializes, we should extend the
                                Yugoslavs maximum political support and selective economic
                                assistance upon request. If military conditions permit and the
                                Yugoslavs ask for help, we should grant them conventional small
                                arms, transport equipment, and spare parts, if we have them.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>Our stake in Yugoslavia since 1948 has been political, economic, and,
                                to an uncertain degree, strategic. Cooperation with the
                                    <persName>Tito</persName> regime has been uneven, both in
                                substance and objective. Although we have had cause to welcome
                                Yugoslav political independence, and its development of considerable
                                domestic liberalization, we have only rarely achieved any identity
                                of views. There has been no effective military relationship for a
                                decade. On most issues affecting world peace or European security
                                the Yugoslav position has been considerably closer to the Soviet
                                than to ours. Recent examples include Viet-Nam and the Middle
                                East.</p>
                            <p>We would nevertheless be deeply concerned over a Soviet invasion,
                                both for the reasons cited in the preceding paragraphs, and because
                                of the evidence it would provide of Soviet readiness to continue an
                                aggressively adventurous course immediately adjacent to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area. If this followed an
                                invasion of Romania, it would be the third case of direct Soviet
                                aggression in Eastern and Central Europe. The argument for
                                considering active counter-measures stems basically, therefore, from
                                the <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0117"/>actual direct danger to
                                US and Western European security interests offered by a Soviet
                                invasion of Yugoslavia.</p>

                            <p>We would want ideally to prevent this invasion without becoming
                                directly involved. In fact, to prevent without involvement is all
                                but impossible, because any truly preventive steps would entail the
                                serious risk of triggering a wider war, but on the other hand our
                                actual security stake in Yugoslavia is too large and immediate for
                                us to resist some type of involvement as proposed below.</p>
                            <p>Our political debt to Yugoslavia for past “favors” is non-existent.
                                In a post-invasion situation, any political or action objectives we
                                might have would be directed almost exclusively to protecting the
                                regional <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> position and
                                forestalling further aggression rather than shielding the

                                            Yugoslavia is more attractive, convenient, and necessary
                                            than assisting Czechoslovakia or Romania. The Yugoslavs
                                            have considerable appeal in the West, they are closer
                                            and more identifiable geographically and, as they have
                                            done so skillfully in the past, they would actively
                                            resist invasion. These and actual military factors are a
                                            strong argument for proferring quick, effective
                                            assistance to Yugoslavia. They are not completely offset
                                            by the character of the <persName>Tito</persName> regime
                                            which, although more “liberal” than that of any other
                                            Communist country, is still basically undemocratic, or
                                            by the fact that the Communist Yugoslav Government has
                                            supported the Soviet position on virtually every major

                            <p>The Soviets can in any case invade and occupy large areas of
                                Yugoslavia quickly and probably effectively with elements from
                                Hungary, Bulgaria, and (by air) the USSR as well as with occupation
                                forces from Czechoslovakia and probably Romania. They would have
                                considerable difficulty, however, in taking the country. The
                                Yugoslav resistance potential is an enormous, proven quantity. It is
                                highly probable that the Western response would, in the final
                                analysis, be directed to bolstering and feeding it.</p>

                                involved. The threat to us would arise from a combination of

                            <p>Austria has no strategic resources or other important strategic
                                considerations except for its geography. The gain of Austrian
                                territory by the Soviet Union, however, would provide it with a more
                                defensible line against the West, would provide it with a natural
                                corridor for access to Yugoslavia, and potentially Italy and

                                corridor for its access to Eastern Europe.</p>

                            <p>Austria has demonstrated in recent weeks its concern regarding Soviet
                                action against Czechoslovakia. That concern would undoubtedly
                                intensify if moves appeared imminent against Romania and Yugoslavia.
                                    <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0120"/>The Austrian press has
                                discussed the desirability of an American guarantee of Austrian
                                neutrality and Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KJ2"

                                no commitment to protect or guarantee that independence. There is no
                                doubt, however, that the loss of Austria would be a severe
                                psychological defeat for the West.</p>

                            <p>The challenge to this country in a Soviet move against Austria would
                                be greatest in its political aspects. Austrian independence and
                                neutrality has been clearly recognized by East and West and has
                                become an important fact of political life in Central Europe over
                                the past 13 years. An effort by the Soviet Union to violate that
                                independence and neutrality would clearly be a change in the status
                                quo which would threaten U.S. national interests.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">

                            </p>
                            <p>There are several possible ways in which the Soviet Union might
                                effect its move against Austria. There could be a request to the
                                Austrian Government for free passage of Warsaw Pact forces across
                                Austrian territory to reach Yugoslavia. There could be an
                                unannounced violation of Austrian air space and territory by Soviet
                                forces en route to Yugoslavia. Finally, there could be a statement
                                by the Soviet Union that Austria was not living up to the terms of
                                the State Treaty and, to protect Austrian independence, the Soviet
                                Union was obliged to move into Austria to carry out the terms of the
                                treaty.</p>
                            <p>We see no likelihood of a coup d'etat in Austria in connection with a
                                Soviet move. The Communist Party is no threat and the Austrian
                                people have clearly demonstrated their disapproval and revulsion of
                                the Soviet moves in Czechoslovakia. Austria has said it would resist
                                any Soviet move by force; our assessment of the capability of the
                                Austrian armed forces, however, leads us to believe that Austrian
                                resistance would be ineffectual militarily, although it might create
                                a psychological impact.</p>
                            <p>

                            <p>The Austrians would undoubtedly respond that, as a neutral and
                                sovereign nation, they could not permit the use of their territory
                                for military operations against another nation. They would probably
                                refer to the State Treaty and call upon the U.S., the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France to intercede with the
                                fourth signatory to honor the obligation in that treaty to respect
                                Austrian <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0121"/>independence. Our
                                response to such a request should be positive. We should issue, in
                                the form of a Presidential or Secretarial statement, a call to the
                                Soviet Union to honor its Treaty obligation. We should announce
                                consultations with the British and French. We should announce our
                                intention to convoke a meeting of the Security Council to discuss
                                this matter on an urgent basis.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">Unannounced Violation</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>The Austrians are fully aware of their inability to oppose the Warsaw
                                Pact forces militarily. Their announced intention to do so is
                                therefore probably aimed at exerting psychological pressure on the
                                West to come to their defense and to help avert their defeat.
                                Depending upon the time available to them, they would undoubtedly
                                make public requests for assistance. These requests would be for
                                ammunition, supplies, arms, air support, and commitment of Western
                                forces, in an ascending order of involvement. Our response to these
                                requests would have to be determined in the light of other
                                developments and requirements for U.S. forces at the same time.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">Alleged Violation of the Treaty</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>The above two scenarios discuss a move by the Soviets against Austria
                                in conjunction with a move against Yugoslavia. It is possible,
                                although less likely, that the Soviets might move against Austria
                                alone, without at the same time undertaking a move into Yugoslavia.
                                Such a move would probably be couched in the terms of a necessity by
                                the Soviet Union to take action to correct a failure by the
                                Austrians to live up to their commitments under the State Treaty,
                                most likely a claim they had violated Article IV which prohibits
                                union with Germany.</p>
                            <p>Our response to this would be framed in terms of the Treaty. The
                                Treaty provides a mechanism for consultation among the four chiefs
                                of mission at Vienna on disputes arising from interpretations of the
                                Treaty and we should use that mechanism to blunt the Soviet charges.
                                Our reaction should be in concert with France and Great Britain and
                                should also include a convening of the Security Council.</p>
                            <p>Finally, however, it is recommended that we consider a preemptive
                                move regarding Austria. Our public statements to date have not
                                referred to Austria specifically and such a reference at an early
                                moment would appear to be appropriate. We should undertake
                                immediately to consult with France and Britain, reminding them they,
                                too, have responsibilities under the State Treaty. We could suggest
                                to them that the Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                    >Stewart</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DM1"
                                    >Debre</persName> call in the respective Soviet Ambassadors and
                                state that recent developments have caused us to re-examine the
                                State Treaty and our mutual obligations thereunder. In order that
                                there be no misunderstanding, each Ambassador would be requested to
                                report to Moscow the firm intention of his host government to uphold
                                and honor the State Treaty and our firm expectation that the Soviet
                                Union would do the <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0122"/>same. The
                                Ambassadors would be asked to convey to Moscow the three
                                governments' views that any Soviet move against Austria would be a
                                grave and serious threat to the peace of Europe and would be
                                considered a clear indication that the Soviet Union was no longer
                                interested in maintaining that peace.</p>

                            Europe, with special reference to the less than desirable level of
                            battle-readiness of certain United States units assigned to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The existing shortfalls in men and
                            materiel were readily explainable, it was pointed out, by the higher
                            priority which had been assigned to support for the war in Viet-Nam and
                            our strategic forces, as well as by the deleterious effect of recent
                            severe budget restrictions.</p>
                        <p>A question was raised concerning the preparedness of the Department of
                            Defense to go to Congress for a supplemental appropriation if the
                            situation in Eastern Europe suddenly took a serious turn for the worse.
                            The reply was that justification for a supplemental could be produced on
                            very short notice. However, in the event of the development of a real
                            crisis—such as Warsaw Pact movement against Berlin—the Department of
                            Defense could raise expenditures for troop support even above the
                            current budget level by using unobligated funds, and seek a supplemental
                            appropriation later. Such short-term excess expenditure could be
                            authorized by the Secretary of Defense even in the absence of a
                            Presidential declaration of a national emergency.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Czech Situation</hi>. One member expressed the opinion
                            that a tighter Soviet squeeze on Czechoslovakia appeared to be in the
                            offing. The Chairman remarked that, after the initial Soviet decision to
                            invade had been taken, it had become less a question of whether there
                            would be a further squeeze than when and how the squeeze would come.
                            Sterner Soviet measures to enforce their will in Czechoslovakia seemed
                            to him to be a foregone conclusion.</p>
                        <p>Other members commented that it must be deeply aggravating to the Soviets
                            that they have not been able to produce even one Czech leader who is
                            willing to state that he requested that Soviet troops enter the country.
                            There was some evidence, it was felt, that the Soviets were attempting
                            to drive a wedge between the Czech and Slovak elements of the
                            population, and simultaneously striving to build up the image of the
                            Slovak politician Husak as a national leader. However, it was pointed
                            out that there were serious limitations on how far the Soviets could
                            carry such a policy. They would be unlikely to favor a federal solution
                            in <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0124"/>Czechoslovakia, with greater
                            autonomy for the Slovaks, because such a development in Czechoslovakia
                            would have great impact on a number of national groups in the USSR
                            itself who desired a greater degree of self-determination.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> then invited Mr.

                            Eastern European situation and the various issues and contingency papers
                            which had been distributed for <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss>
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> noted that the <gloss

                            informational, while those on Romania, Yugoslavia and Austria were
                            action-oriented and would require further study and refinement. He did
                            not propose to summarize all the papers but would comment on selected
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Deterrent Actions</hi>. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> observed that most planning
                            heretofore had been slanted towards defining United States responses to
                            selected contingency situations in Eastern Europe. He now hoped to give
                            increasing emphasis to possible deterrent actions that could be taken
                            right now to help prevent further Soviet aggression in Eastern Europe.
                            Our options in this area might be limited, but there were certain things
                            we could do to signal our concern to the Soviets. He felt, for example,
                            that a firm United States posture in 1951 had been influential in
                            deterring Soviet action against Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary's recent speech to the United Nations General Assembly<note

                            focus public attention on the aggressive Soviet posture in the Balkans
                            and to discredit the Soviet attempt in <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> to
                            formulate a philosophy to justify armed intervention in the affairs of

                        <p>In the Yugoslav case, it would be desirable to encourage further
                            high-level visits such as that of <persName>Gligorov</persName> to the
                            United States. (<persName corresp="#p_HPC1">Harmel</persName> and

                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said, were also useful
                            in signalling our general concern about possible Soviet moves against
                                Romania.)<note n="5" xml:id="d24fn5">British Foreign Secretary
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Michael Stewart</persName> visited
                                Bucharest September 8–9; Belgian Foreign Minister <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HPC1">Pierre Harmel</persName> visited Bucharest
                                September 13.</note> Such visits had the salutary effect of
                            underlining the continuity of Western ties with the Yugoslav regime.
                            Similarly, we (as well as the British and French who were partners in
                            the effort) ought to make public reference to the 17-year-long tradition
                            of United States assistance to Yugoslavia, without in any way committing
                            ourselves to specific actions in the event of a Soviet attack. This
                            would have to be done carefully and <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97"
                                facs="0125"/>in an appropriate context to avoid giving the Soviets a
                            green light on Romania.</p>
                        <p>Another suggestion offered was a quiet campaign to convince Western
                            European Communist Parties to come out more explicitly against Soviet
                            intervention in Eastern Europe, and to induce some reputable European
                            newspaper or periodical—preferably socialist or even communist in
                            sympathy—to devote more critical attention to the Pravda justification
                            for Soviet intervention. The point should be driven home that such a
                            philosophy is unrelated to Marxist-Leninist theory, and in fact could
                            most accurately be characterized as Hitlerian.</p>
                        <p>Some members pointed out that we must plan for a progression of deterrent
                            actions designed to suit differing scenarios. Following a Soviet
                            invasion of Romania, for example, we should have in mind a series of
                            much stiffer actions to warn the Soviets of our increased concern over
                            the sovereignty of Yugoslavia. These might include overt military moves
                            such as rapid reinforcement of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> air
                            squadrons in Italy, and naval maneuvers by the United States Sixth Fleet
                            in the Adriatic.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> commented that at that
                            point we should also be fully prepared to move quickly in the United
                            Nations. He felt that the General Assembly should be seized of the
                            problem as soon as possible, because in the case of Yugoslavia we could
                            probably obtain widespread support for deterrent action.</p>
                        <p>The Chairman commented that he felt the best way to deter further Soviet
                            military action in Eastern Europe was to keep raising the cost to the
                            Soviets of their invasion of Czechoslovakia. There was a growing
                            tendency to begin to accept the Czech episode as closed, which only
                            played into Soviet hands. The degree to which we are able to keep the
                            occupation of Czechoslovakia a painful and embarrassing subject for the
                            Soviets inevitably would influence their decision whether to embark on
                            similar adventures in Romania or Yugoslavia.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The Balkan Pact</hi>. There was general agreement that

                                >NATO</gloss> needed further study. At the time of the signing of

                            coordination between the Yugoslavs and the Greeks. In the event of a
                            serious military threat, the Greeks had been granted the right to move
                            into the southern tip of Yugoslavia to defend the approaches to Greece,
                            and there had been exchanges of information on the military staff level.
                            The degree to which this cooperation had persisted in more recent years

                                >Leddy</persName> commented that the contingency of Soviet military
                            pressure on Austria was less likely but more complicated than the cases
                            of either Romania or Yugoslavia. If the Austrian State Treaty were
                            violated by the Soviets—for example, by seizure of their previous zone
                            of occupation—United States action would have to be concerted in advance
                            with the United Kingdom, France, and Austria. A great deal more
                            preliminary work remained to be done in this area. Furthermore, we were
                            assuming that Austria would reject a Soviet demand for the right of
                            transit of Soviet troops. But what would we do if the Austrians, under
                            great pressure, agreed to such transit? Would we consider this grounds
                            to justify our re-occupation of Austrian territory under the State
                            Treaty?</p>

                            rather bland in its estimate of the current threat, especially in regard

                                >CDU</gloss> convention to be held in West Berlin. No such
                            convention had been held there since 1952, and the resumption of this
                            degree of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> political activity in
                            Berlin might be considered highly provocative. In addition, when

                            Berlin, it was probably wrong to assume that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> would agree to any restrictions on Inter-Zonal Trade

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> suggested that a useful

                            another possibility would be a quiet diplomatic note on the subject from
                            the United States, United Kingdom, and France delivered simultaneously
                            to the Soviets, but it was pointed out that if the advice was to be
                            effective, it would have to be publicized.</p>
                        <p>Whatever the course of Berlin contingency planning, General Wheeler
                            remarked that he hoped no one would recommend stationing more United
                            States troops in the city. In the first place, there were too few
                            available elsewhere in Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1"
                                >Leddy</persName> agreed that the military effectiveness <pb n="99"
                                xml:id="pg_99" facs="0127"/>of a build-up in the Berlin garrison
                            would be most doubtful, and it would not provide any real increase in
                            deterrence against Soviet and East German military action. The only true
                            guarantee for the existence of West Berlin remained the United States
                            warning to the Soviets that overstepping a given line would mean
                            war.</p>
                        <p>Discussion of Berlin concluded with a series of comments regarding the
                            growing reluctance of the World Bank to schedule its 1970 meeting in
                            West Berlin. The French reportedly had passed the word that a meeting in
                            Berlin would be unacceptable, and authorities at the World Bank had
                            begun to talk of serious difficulties with the Yugoslavs, Arabs, and
                            others if such a meeting were scheduled. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had informally expressed his
                            preference for Copenhagen to avoid these problems. Some international
                            bankers had begun to speak deprecatingly of the economic future of
                            Berlin as a result of its constant population drain, especially in the
                            younger segments of society, and its failure to achieve economic
                            viability.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> expressed the opinion
                            that the United States must work to stem this tide, and continue to
                            support the convening of the World Bank meeting in Berlin. It was true
                            that Berlin was plagued by economic problems, mostly understandable as a
                            result of the peculiar situation of the city, but these in no way
                            diminished our national interest in Berlin nor should they weaken our
                            support for the World Bank meeting there in 1970.</p>
                        <p>At this point the Chairman and other members were required to leave in
                            order to attend a White House ceremony. Since there remained ample
                            ground for further discussion of Eastern European problems, the Chairman
                            suggested that the <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> Staff Director
                            would be in touch with <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> members on
                            the advisability of scheduling another meeting on the same subject.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary emphasized the importance of being clear in advance as to
                            what our commitments are vis-á-vis situations possibly involving war.
                                <persName>Debre</persName> reiterated the importance of the
                            distinction he had drawn in his talks in New York between a Soviet move
                            against Romania and any <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0129"/>such
                            move against West Berlin, Yugoslavia or Austria. The Secretary agreed
                            that there would be significant differences between these two types of
                            action. He added that the United States was watching Soviet troop
                            movements carefully. We do not see any imminent Soviet threat today
                            against Romania, Yugoslavia or Austria. The Secretary added that Soviet
                            intervention in Romania might well be designed to prepare a move against
                            Yugoslavia. <persName>Debre</persName> observed with feeling that any
                            new Soviet moves would close the door to a resumption of Western
                            conversations with the Soviet Union. <persName>Debre</persName> thought
                            that the Soviets were aware of this and would give it considerable
                            weight in planning their future actions. The Secretary hoped that
                                <persName>Debre</persName> was right but he was personally less
                            confident that this factor would deter them. When the Russians judge
                            that their fundamental interests are involved, the Secretary said, it is
                            difficult to know in advance how far they will allow themselves to
                            go.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>M. Debre</persName> declared that the French Government
                            operated on the postulate that Russia did not want to become a country
                            which was forced to choose “guns over butter.” Such a development within
                            Russia would mean a return to the worse days of the Stalin period. It
                            would also mean that the Soviets accepted the possibility of a new war.
                            When and if this day comes, <persName>Debre</persName> continued,
                            “everything would change” including their leadership and our estimate of
                            their policies and intentions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that hopefully the Russians may now be learning
                            that some things cannot be accomplished by means of armies of
                            occupation. If so, this would be a helpful development. The Secretary
                            asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> to look into the
                            feasibility of expanding our information programs to Yugoslavia and
                            other Eastern European countries to accentuate the message regarding the

                            them from the Czech experience. In the event of Soviet intervention and
                            occupation the local Communist party must change one leader out of every

                            <item>The Soviets intervened in Czechoslovakia because of their genuine
                                fear that the existence of a reliable Communist authority in Prague
                                was threatened by the reform movement in the Czechoslovak Party. The
                                Soviet leaders believed that if this development was not checked
                                their hegemony would ultimately be jeopardized in Eastern Europe as
                                a whole. The process of forcing the Czechs back into the approved
                                mold is proceeding slowly, and the Soviets may be obliged in the end
                                to move directly against the Prague leadership.</item>

                            <item>Both Romania and Yugoslavia will remain apprehensive about Soviet
                                intentions for some time, especially in view of Soviet assertions of
                                a right to intervene in Socialist countries. The Soviets probably do
                                not now contemplate any direct military action against Romania,
                                although other means of pressure can be expected. A Soviet military
                                move against Yugoslavia seems even less likely. Although by its
                                action against Czechoslovakia the USSR has probably for the time
                                being discouraged assertions of national independence among its East
                                European allies, the growth of anti-Soviet nationalism in the area
                                seems likely to continue and to produce new manifestations of
                                resistance to Soviet authority.</item>

                            <item>The present Soviet leadership will probably continue to strike a
                                course somewhere between attempting to restore complete subservience
                                in Eastern Europe and accommodating the trend toward independence
                                and the expression of national peculiarities. The Council for Mutual
                                Economic Assistance will remain generally ineffective, both as an
                                instrument of Soviet hegemony and as a means of fostering East
                                European economic development. Within the Warsaw Pact, the Soviets
                                will probably feel obliged to place greater reliance on their own
                                forces and less on those of the East Europeans.</item>

                            <item>Although the Soviet leaders were probably in basic agreement that
                                measures had to be taken to arrest the reform movement in
                                Czechoslovakia, over time this crisis will probably sharpen a number
                                of chronically <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0131"/>troublesome
                                issues within the Soviet leadership. Yet the Soviet leaders are
                                likely to realize that this is not a propitious time for open
                                displays of disunity. Among other things, they are probably
                                concerned over the effects of their actions of Czechoslovakia on the
                                Soviet population itself.</item>

                            <item>The Soviet move in Czechoslovakia did not signify a general
                                hardening of Moscow's policies toward the West. The Soviet
                                leadership considers the Czechoslovak problem as one internal to its
                                own sphere. But Moscow's attitude toward West Germany will remain
                                quite harsh and the Soviets may authorize the East Germans to
                                undertake new harassments aimed at the West German position in
                                Berlin.</item>

                            <item>The dust and debris raised by the Soviet invasion of
                                Czechoslovakia have yet to settle, and the uncertainties left in its
                                wake involve more than the kind of regime which will govern in
                                Prague. Also affected are Moscow's attitudes toward West Germany and
                                the Berlin question, its policies toward the other Communist
                                mavericks, Yugoslavia and Romania, and its posture toward Eastern
                                Europe as a whole. Involved in addition are the broader questions of
                                the USSR's policies toward Western Europe and the US and its
                                position in the international Communist movement. Finally, the Czech
                                events could affect the relative positions of the various Soviet
                                leaders and the stability of the leadership as a whole, which may
                                have been shaken by differences over Soviet policies during the
                                crisis.</item>

                            <item>The Soviet leadership's decision to invade and occupy
                                Czechoslovakia was apparently arrived at with some reluctance. It
                                came only after various other forms of pressure on the Czechoslovak
                                regime had failed and, presumably, after the leadership had decided
                                that the risks of nonintervention simply outweighed all the probable
                                costs of an invasion. The Soviet leaders, or a majority of them,
                                came to believe that the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was no
                                longer reliable and was in effect abandoning control over the
                                country to the “counter-revolutionaries;“ that Czechoslovakia was
                                edging toward at least a de facto withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact
                                and a policy of neutrality; and that the West, and especially West
                                Germany, was almost certain to gain greater influence in Prague.
                                Moscow apparently calculated that the political and strategic
                                consequences of these developments would shake its position in the
                                other countries of Eastern Europe. And the Soviet leaders feared
                                that this, together with the example of a liberalized socialism in
                                Czechoslovakia, would ultimately have deeply unsettling effects on
                                the Soviet population itself.</item>

                            <item>The intervention did arrest the political developments in
                                Czechoslovakia which the Soviets viewed as dangerous, but the
                                process of forcing the Czechs back into the approved mold is taking
                                some time. Moscow would like to avoid further violence and to oblige
                                the Czech leaders themselves to take the responsibility for undoing
                                the reforms so intensely supported by the population. Probably
                                Moscow would also like to discredit the present leaders and to
                                displace them with others willing to collaborate in the old way. To
                                this end the Soviets are trying to build up a pro-Soviet faction
                                within the Party and to place men loyal to themselves in the
                                security organs and communications media. Their hope is that
                                ultimately the present leaders, under the demoralizing conditions of
                                occupation, can be divided among themselves and discredited with the
                                population.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>It is difficult to see how the present indirect manifestations of
                                resistance can be sustained indefinitely or how these alone could
                                force the Soviets to abandon the aims for which they intervened. If
                                necessary, the Soviets will probably take direct measures to install
                                a reliable leadership and will use force to suppress any
                                demonstrations by the population. If they are obliged to go to these
                                lengths, however, the political costs of the intervention will be
                                compounded and the problems of maintaining Soviet hegemony in
                                Eastern Europe will in the longer term be still further
                                complicated.</item>

                            <item>Among the other states of Eastern Europe, Romania and Yugoslavia
                                were most immediately affected by the shock waves flowing from the
                                Soviet action. Fear of a similar Soviet move against themselves was
                                for a time quite high in both Belgrade and Bucharest. The reactions
                                in each capital, however, seem to have been different. Following a
                                brief period of public outrage, the Romanians have, on the whole,
                                been more restrained. Clearly, as initial fears recede, the
                                    <persName>Ceausescu</persName> regime is determined not to
                                surrender its sovereignty, but it is equally anxious to tailor its
                                actions so as not to provoke Moscow into moves against it. Tito, on
                                the other hand, was appalled by the invasion and—more certain of his
                                independence—was perfectly willing to say so to the Soviets and to
                                the world at large. The Yugoslavs saw in the invasion an assault on
                                their own principles and policies, both domestic and foreign, and
                                foresee a long period of strain in their relations with the
                                USSR.</item>

                            <item>Soviet pressures on Romania and hostility toward Yugoslavia seem
                                likely for some time to come. Anti-Yugoslav propaganda, some of it
                                directed against <persName>Tito</persName> personally, will probably
                                remain fairly intense, in part because of Moscow's anxiety to remind
                                the other East Europeans of its attitude toward all forms of
                                “revisionism.” Pressures on Romania, perhaps including hints of
                                military moves and additional demands <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105"
                                    facs="0133"/>regarding Warsaw Pact maneuvers on Romanian soil,
                                will probably continue at least so long as Bucharest insists on
                                behaving in an independent, and at times, unfriendly fashion. The
                                Soviets probably do not now contemplate any direct military action
                                against Romania, however, partly because of their calculations of
                                the political costs and partly because they do not consider Romania

                                against Yugoslavia seems even less likely. Nevertheless,
                                apprehension about Soviet intentions will persist in both countries
                                for some time, especially in view of the Soviet assertion of a right

                                with the USSR. These will probably be widely regarded as a simple

                                however, the Hungarians are likely to appreciate more than ever
                                that, under Kadar, they have enjoyed relative prosperity and
                                freedom. Ulbricht, in East Germany, has seen his harsh attitude

                                thus vindicated), but he has also had to face increased expressions

                                set limits on the permissible. No party will be allowed to share
                                power with other organized groups, to institute programs of reform
                                which significantly <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0134"

                                restraints on public media. Further, all parties will be under
                                stronger pressure to follow foreign policies (as, for example,
                                toward West Germany) which adhere to guidelines laid down by Moscow.
                                For the next few years, Moscow has probably assured a larger measure
                                of compliance from its East European allies, though most of them
                                will continue to seek ways to pursue their own interests as best
                                they can. In any event, resentment of Soviet authority will no doubt
                                continue to smolder, and the political and economic forces working
                                for greater national independence, though subdued or underground,
                                will continue to pose a threat to tranquility and to the Soviet

                                <p>The Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia probably served, in
                                    fact, to dramatize for all the East European peoples the power
                                    and the appeal of the Czech movement and the poverty of Soviet
                                    efforts to contain it. Thus while certainly made aware of the
                                    risks of going beyond the bounds now firmly set by Moscow, East
                                    Europeans have also been reminded once again of their unhappy
                                    relationship with a doctrinaire, reactionary, and oppressive
                                    neighbor. Many East Europeans were clearly chagrined by the
                                    invasion of Czechoslovakia and by the use of East European
                                    forces in that invasion. All in all, if the Soviet move has
                                    served to erect new barriers against the advance of national
                                    independence in Eastern Europe, it has also surely failed to
                                    halt the growth of a strong anti-Soviet nationalism behind those

                                into a largely voluntary association of allied states owing
                                political and ideological allegiance to Moscow. The use of terror

                                between “fraternal” Communist Parties were emphasized. In addition,
                                multilateral organizations, principally the Council for Mutual
                                Economic Assistance (<gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss>) and the

                                exercising their Bloc-wide dominance. At least some Soviet leaders
                                apparently believed that a true “socialist commonwealth” could be
                                established on these new foundations and that it was only
                                natural—and in accord with Marxism-Leninism—for the various states
                                of the commonwealth to identify their national aspirations with
                                those of the USSR. Other Soviet leaders were perhaps more cynical
                                but seemed to be convinced that they could establish a harmonious
                                and viable empire on the basis of strong inter-Party ties.</item>

                                few years later. Romania has gradually been acquiring a large
                                measure of freedom from Soviet dominance since the early 1960's. And

                                counterrevolution” by the Soviets, was well on its way in 1968. Over
                                the past 15 years, then, only one of the USSR's allies in Eastern

                                Romania, for example, has since 1963 persistently refused to

                                Moscow must consider that the Czech Army can no longer function as a
                                reliable instrument of Soviet policy, and must also be concerned
                                about manifestations of nationalism in the armed forces of other
                                allied states. As a simple matter of prudence, the Soviets probably
                                feel obliged to place greater reliance on their own forces and less
                                on those of the East Europeans. Moscow may now seriously consider
                                not only the strengthening of its forces in Eastern Europe, but may
                                also seek ways to achieve a more closely integrated Warsaw Pact
                                command structure. Steps such as these would be useful not only
                                against <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> but also as a means to
                                develop a stronger instrument of control within Eastern
                                Europe.</item>

                            <item>The Soviets have for some time sought to enlist the voluntary
                                compliance of the Eastern European regimes but they have also been
                                ready to apply pressure whenever it seemed necessary. Though this
                                approach has been found severely wanting, they probably are not at
                                this point prepared to make many changes in their general policies
                                in Eastern Europe. The Soviet attitude will probably be more
                                unyielding for a time toward deviations, and on key issues Moscow
                                will almost certainly remain harsh and demanding. But it does not
                                now seem that the Soviets are prepared to attempt a general rollback
                                in Eastern Europe toward complete subservience and orthodoxy. Nor,
                                however, does it seem at all <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0137"
                                />likely that the present leadership will entertain any notions of a
                                basic accommodation to the trend toward independence and the
                                expression of national peculiarities.</item>

                            <item>Over the longer term, of course, when new leaders appear in
                                Moscow, the Soviets might come to adapt themselves to the process
                                that is underway in Eastern Europe. They could, for example, become
                                less and less concerned about the orthodoxy of other Communist
                                parties and less and less enchanted with the dreary prospects (and
                                rising costs) of trying to maintain their imperial position. Such a
                                stance would certainly have its advantages: it would help to improve
                                relations between Moscow and the presently disgruntled leaders of
                                Western European Communist parties; it would permit a return to
                                détente policies vis-á-vis Western Europe as a whole, West Germany
                                excepted; and it would help to advance the USSR's prestige within
                                the international Communist movement and within the Third
                                World.</item>

                            <item>The ideas and character of the next generation of Soviet leaders
                                are not, however, predictable, and we certainly do not look forward
                                to any change in fundamental Soviet attitudes toward Eastern Europe
                                within the foreseeable future. Probably for a long time, hegemony
                                exercised on the present pattern will be seen as vital to Soviet
                                national interests. Certainly the present Soviet leaders have shown
                                no disposition to allow it to crumble. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"

                                growth of Eastern European nationalism, and given the continuing
                                determination of the Soviets to combat it, tensions between ruler
                                and ruled are likely to be endemic and further crises appear almost

                            <item>Throughout the recent period of crisis in Eastern Europe, the
                                Soviet leadership acted in public as a unified collective. But
                                Brezhnev, as the most powerful figure on the Politburo and as the
                                leader who was earlier most closely identified with both
                                    <persName>Novotny</persName> and Czechoslovakia, was generally
                                thought to be the major architect of the USSR's policies and the man
                                most responsible for its setbacks. It seems likely that the
                                leadership as a whole was essentially united on the principal
                                proposition: the course followed by the new leadership of
                                Czechoslovakia threatened the vital interests of the USSR. It seems
                                plausible, however, that there were different currents of opinion
                                within the leadership over the degree of danger Czechoslovakia
                                represented at any given moment and over what should be done by the

                                distress perhaps of some of the leaders especially concerned with
                                the growth of the civilian economy. Policy choices bearing on the
                                international Communist movement and on relations with the West may
                                become more contentious. Discontented and ambitious leaders can be
                                expected to try to weaken the position of rivals who might appear

                            <item>The collective has endured for almost four years, and its ability
                                so far to govern with few signs of inner turmoil has surpassed most
                                expectations. The Czech problem probably presented it with its most
                                difficult hours and may have placed some of the top leaders in a

                                in the conduct of Soviet affairs abroad, there is no evidence at
                                this time that any other leader has the strength to displace him. It
                                also seems unlikely that a move against <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"

                            <item>The Soviet leaders will wish to preserve the appearance of unity
                                within the collective in part because of their probable concern over
                                the effects of their actions in Czechoslovakia on popular attitudes
                                at home. Though many Soviet citizens seem at least initially to have
                                accepted the rationale for the invasion, or to have been apathetic
                                about the whole affair, some of the intelligentsia entertained
                                strong doubts about the official reasons given. (Abrupt changes and
                                contradictions in the Party line—e.g., toward the character of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Alexander Dubcek</persName>—would be
                                enough in their own right to foster skepticism, or at least
                                bewilderment.) Some Soviet intellectuals—who looked on democratic
                                developments in Czechoslovakia as a happy augury for their own
                                circumstances—have apparently been greatly agitated by the invasion
                                and, in some instances, anxious privately to disown it. Finally,
                                within Soviet minority groups, most notably in the Ukraine, there
                                apparently had been growing interest in what was going on in
                                Czechoslovakia, especially concerning the implications for the USSR
                                of Prague's newly tolerant attitude toward its own national
                                minorities.</item>

                                    the USSR has existed for some time, the growth of democratic and
                                    nationalist sentiments in Eastern Europe seems to have
                                    stimulated similar attitudes in the USSR. In fact, despite
                                    increasingly repressive official policies, signs of disaffection
                                    within the Soviet Union have recently become more frequent. Both
                                    intellectuals and members of minority groups appear to have
                                    become more sullen and less disposed to cooperate with the

                                occupation itself. The move in Czechoslovakia did not signify the
                                USSR's intention to undertake a general hardening of its policies
                                toward the West. As Gromyko made explicit in his recent speech to
                                the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet leadership considers
                                the Czecho-slovak problem as one internal to its own sphere, and
                                therefore as a matter not subject to discussion with outside powers.
                                The Soviet effort to solve this problem was conceived and executed
                                in this context, and the Soviets have sought—except partially in the
                                special case of West Germany—to avoid entangling their policies
                                elsewhere in the world with their actions against Prague. That is to
                                say, Moscow has made no deliberate moves to change course toward the

                                such as the institution of New York-Moscow air services, do not
                                appear jeopardized, but proposals for arms control and disarmament,
                                already inherently difficult of accomplishment, face formidable new
                                obstacles. The economic and military interests which seemed to be

                                developments in Eastern Europe, though the consensus within the
                                collective on this subject may well be affected by the atmosphere of
                                renewed tension generated by the Czech events. Much will now depend
                                also, of course, on the impact of recent events on the attitudes and
                                policies of the US.</item>

                            <item>Concerning Germany, the current heavy propaganda and diplomatic
                                campaign against Bonn seems primarily to represent an effort to levy
                                blame for the Czechoslovak crisis on the most convenient and useful
                                outside scapegoat. This effort happens to coincide quite well with
                                the traditional Soviet attitude toward Bonn, and also serves as a
                                rationale for the permanent stationing of Soviet troops in
                                Czechoslovakia. It seems likely that the USSR's attitude toward West
                                Germany will remain quite harsh, in part because Moscow fears West
                                Germany's relations with Eastern Europe as a potential alternative
                                to Soviet influence. The Soviets clearly want no further forward
                                movement of Bonn's Ostpolitik.</item>

                            <item>One way of seeking to blunt these West German policies and of
                                bringing direct pressure to bear on Bonn would be to renew the
                                campaign <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0140"/>against the West
                                German presence and activities in West Berlin. The Soviets realize,
                                however, that in the wake of the events in Czechoslovakia, sudden
                                moves by them in Berlin could quickly generate a major crisis. They
                                probably will not, therefore, attack the Allied presence in Berlin
                                directly but, instead, may authorize the East Germans to undertake
                                new harassments aimed at the West German position. On the whole, we
                                think the chances are good that there will be a renewal of tensions
                                around Berlin in coming months.</item>

                            <item>In Western Europe, the Soviets are seeking to repair the damage
                                done their relations with the various governments and the local
                                Communist Parties by the invasion of Czechoslovakia. There are no
                                signs that Moscow is prepared to depart from its preinvasion efforts
                                to cultivate good will, especially in France. Its task is much more
                                difficult now, however, and the heavy-handed propaganda tactics used
                                against Bonn have greatly reduced Western Europe's receptiveness to
                                détente overtures. But the Soviets are anxious, apparently, to
                                convince the West Europeans that their move against Prague was
                                essentially defensive and is not to be seen as a threat against the
                                integrity of any Western country. Kosygin's sudden visit to Finland
                                was probably undertaken to calm Finnish apprehensions about Soviet
                                policy. To a certain extent, of course, the state of relations
                                between East and West is a matter of atmospherics. If the situation
                                in Czechoslovakia appears to return to “normal,” concern in Western
                                Europe will gradually abate, and the Soviets will probably then
                                revert to the themes of European security and détente which have
                                been featured in their policy for the last several years.</item>

                            <item>Moscow's relationship with many Communist Parties has been heavily
                                damaged by the action against Czechoslovakia. The international
                                Communist conference, which has long been sought by the Soviets and
                                has now had to be postponed, will have little chance of restoring
                                Communist unity. Both the French and Italian Parties counseled
                                against the intervention but were disregarded by Moscow. Official
                                Soviet doctrine now emphasizes that the USSR has a duty when
                                necessary to interfere in the affairs of any fraternal Communist
                                state, and with military force if circumstances require. The French
                                and Italian Parties have rejected this proposition, in part from the
                                conviction that it is ideologically untenable, in part from the
                                knowledge that it is indefensible to their local electorates.
                                Despite grumbling by their Stalinist minorities and pressure from
                                Moscow, the major West European Parties have maintained their
                                initial disapproval of Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia. They
                                will not be pressured into reversing this decision, although they
                                will continue to pay lip service to “proletarian internationalism”
                                and friendship with the USSR. The Soviets have little prospect of
                                restoring the position of commanding influence over the
                                international Communist movement they once held.</item>

                        <p>I first presented at some length US views and reactions to Bulgarian
                            December 27 attack,<note n="3" xml:id="d27fn3">On the second day of the

                                employees.</note> pointing out inevitable harmful consequences which
                            attack has already produced on Bulgarian-US relations, adding this
                            attack had impaired my personal confidence in future Bulgarian
                            intentions. I also emphasized that attack had been harmful to Bulgaria's
                            expressed interest in increasing trade and tourism with U.S. in view of
                            damage done to good will of American people and that doubts had been
                            raised in minds of U.S. Government officials. I stressed the outrage
                            felt by U.S. press and public opinion.</p>
                        <p>I then stated my Government and I emphatically reject Bulgarian demand
                            that Legation close its windows, adding U.S. considers this an attack on
                            Legation's inviolability and direct contradiction to Vienna
                                convention.<note n="4" xml:id="d27fn4">For text of the convention on

                            has only contributed to worsening our already seriously damaged
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>Finally I suggested that if Bulgarian Government wished to try to regain
                            some of its lost good will and prestige Bulgarians should put forward
                            some alternative constructive proposals which might help to improve
                            relations. I said I would be glad to meet <persName corresp="#p_BI1"
                                >Bashev</persName> in few days to discuss such constructive

                            <persName corresp="#p_BI1">Bashev</persName> responded by repeating his
                            earlier claims that December 27 attack was “spontaneous” demonstration
                            which Bulgarian Government <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0142"

                                >Georgiev</persName>, he mentioned attack as a popular reaction to

                        </p>
                        <p>He then brought up NBC–TV film re my activities in Bulgaria which he said
                            Bulgarian Government considers offensive. He blames U.S. Government for
                            permitting film he considered derogatory to Bulgaria to be shown in U.S.
                            After quoting from this TV script he turned to subject of Legation
                            windows. He implied that unless we yielded to demand Bulgarian people
                            would be told about NBC–TV derogatory film which might revoke another
                            “spontaneous” demonstration. I categorically rejected any responsibility
                            for NBC–TV film emphasizing that U.S. Government has no control over TV
                            industry, which is entirely private.</p>

                            responded I could not accept this demand but I would be willing to meet
                            him again in few days to discuss alternative proposals of constructive
                            nature.</p>

                            conducted in serious, calm and unyielding vein on my part.</p>

                            However, later he again repeated his demand in much the same terms as
                            previously.</p>
                        <p>I believe extreme sensitivity shown by <persName corresp="#p_BI1"
                                >Bashev</persName> and Bulgarian Government regarding unfavorable
                            publicity in U.S. may be restraining factor in further demonstrations
                            against windows. <persName corresp="#p_BI1">Bashev</persName> did not
                            cite any instances of improper use of windows. Only justification given
                            for closure request concerned extra situations such as NBC–TV film and
                            so-called Bulgarian popular reaction against U.S. Noteworthy that
                            although I mentioned several times the hope that Bulgaria and U.S. could
                            resume improvement of our relations <persName corresp="#p_BI1"
                                >Bashev</persName> responded to this by saying “we wish to develop
                            normal relations with U.S.” This is distinctly retrogressive in contrast
                            to position taken by Chernev December 31.</p>
                        <p>Legation intends to maintain normal window display and await
                            developments. I believe we have given <persName corresp="#p_BI1"
                                >Bashev</persName> sufficient opportunities to take up some new line
                            and that meanwhile we should remain unyielding.</p>

                            US-Bulgarian relations are concerned. He didn't think they were very
                            good. There had been absolutely no improvements that he could see. He
                            did thank me for my statement, but he said that unfortunately he found
                            no reasons to say there was any normal basis for developing our
                            relations. The United States, he went on, does not show enough
                            understanding to enable such development to take place.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BI1">Bashev</persName> claimed that he has said
                            more than once that the development of relations between our two
                            countries must be on a mutual basis. At present such a basis does not
                            exist. The US has not changed its attitude in the economic field. “We
                            see nothing positive that has been done on the part of the United
                            States,” he said. “You continue to discriminate against our commodities.
                            This hampers our exports. The fact that some export licenses have been
                            issued cannot be considered as a change in attitude on the part of the
                            United States. Trade should be two-way trade. This does not exist now
                            due to discriminatory measures on your part. Bulgaria sees no goodwill
                            on the part of the United States.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Bashev</persName> continued as follows:</p>
                        <p>The Bulgarian Government has not changed its desire to develop good
                            relations with the United States. This has been stated in the past by
                                <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0146"/>the Bulgarian Prime
                            Minister and by other responsible officials. And again I am repeating
                            it. I was authorized to say that the Bulgarian Government has the desire
                            to normalize and improve relations with the United States, but we do not
                            see such readiness on your part.</p>
                        <p>I can give two examples to substantiate my statement. Some time ago we
                            signed the claims agreement.<note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3">For text of this
                                agreement, signed in Sofia on July 2, 1963, see 14 UST 969.</note>
                            The USA expressed at that time its readiness to develop trade, but
                            nothing has been done. During my conversation with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>,<note n="4" xml:id="d29fn4">They
                                met at New York on September 30, 1963; see <ref

                                    Document 22</ref>.</note> the latter stated that, although there
                            were no legal possibilities to change the discriminatory measures in the
                            trade field, the Department of State might take some other “special
                            measures” to alleviate the situation. No steps were taken.</p>
                        <p>We buy some US commodities. We may continue to do so for some time. But
                            if the US does not buy our commodities, we will look for other markets
                            which are opening up for us. The US found it impossible to sell
                            electrical locomotives to us. We were able to buy them somewhere else.
                            If the US decides “magnanimously” (here <persName corresp="#p_BI1"
                                >Bashev</persName> became sarcastic) to sell some goods to us, this
                            is no help in bettering our relations. We would like conditions on equal
                            footing. Whether this can be done by some legislative action, or
                            otherwise, I do not know. This is your business. If the US has no
                            interest in improving our relations, we will understand that, too; but
                            the United States should also understand us.</p>
                        <p>We cannot confine our relations to cultural relations, only. This is of
                            small interest to us. For us, the important thing is to develop normal
                            economic relations, not because we are compelled to buy from the United
                            States but because this would amount to the establishment of normal
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>In absence of appropriate changes on the part of the US toward Bulgaria,
                            we will be compelled to believe that some elements in the US unfriendly
                            to our country are influencing our relations. You know very well what I
                            mean. There were statements made in the US Congress addressed to
                            so-called nationalist groups. At the present time we do not see enough
                            good will on the part of the US ruling circles. Of course, visits by
                            American public opinion leaders to Bulgaria and the visit of Minister
                            Vachkov and his group to the US are positive factors but they are not
                            sufficient to change our relations. We should not minimize the
                            importance of such visits, nor should we overestimate it.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>I said I was disappointed and surprised to hear <persName
                                corresp="#p_BI1">Bashev</persName> speak like this. I reminded him,
                            as I have done many times before, that trade is a two-way street. I said
                            we have done everything we could to try to improve relations. I said it
                            was very surprising to me if he thought that economic relations could
                            exist in a vacuum. For us, trade is only a part of good
                            relations—diplomatic, cultural and political relations are also part of
                            the picture. Unfortunately, I said, there has been very little progress
                            during the past year. I reminded him that the December attack on our
                            Legation has made it virtually impossible for me to work toward
                            bettering relations. I said that if he did not understand the effect
                            that the December attack on the Legation and subsequent bad publicity
                            had had on American public opinion, then he did not understand the
                            American people and our Government. I said that he must understand we
                            cannot possibly give Bulgaria <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            treatment at present; that Congressional action is required. Even if
                            Congress should in the future extend <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            treatment to Rumania, I said, there is no guarantee that Bulgaria will
                            receive it. There must be a general improvement in our relations.</p>
                        <p>I went on to say that I believe that the terms on which export licenses
                            are being issued to Bulgaria are good ones. If they were not, Bulgaria
                            would not accept them.</p>
                        <p>Concluding, I reiterated that I see the relations between our countries
                            in a broad spectrum—diplomatic, political, cultural and trade relations.
                            Maybe <persName corresp="#p_BI1">Bashev</persName> is interested only in
                            trade, but we are interested in all aspects. I would like to see an
                            improvement of our general relations before I could recommend special
                            trade concessions.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BI1">Bashev</persName> repeated his same old
                            statement, saying we were not living up to our word. I asked him to be
                            specific: what specifically did he want. He merely repeated the same two
                            examples of our alleged failure to live up to promises to help develop
                            trade, made when we signed the claims agreement and during the <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_BI1"
                                >Bashev</persName> talks. Then he went into the question of US
                            purchases of Bulgarian tobacco. He complained that the US buys Oriental
                            tobacco from some countries at 12 percent tariff but that Bulgarian
                            tobacco continues to have the 36 percent tariff.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BI1">Bashev</persName> said that other countries
                            do not talk about public opinion as a factor governing bilateral
                            relations. He said, “We trade with England, Japan, West Germany, Italy,
                            and the Scandinavian countries—none of them raise such problems. Why
                            should the United States?” He said he would like to remind me that
                            Bulgaria, too, has public opinion, and that this is very important to
                            the Bulgarian Government.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BI1">Bashev</persName> repeated once again that
                            there are few encouraging factors in our relations. He said Bulgaria
                            considers that it is the fault of the United States. Bulgaria has
                            declared that it is ready to develop relations.</p>
                        <p>This is not our first conversation on this subject, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BI1">Bashev</persName> recalled. He asked that I
                            understand two points well: (1) trade is not the content of our
                            relations but only the basis; (2) Bulgaria does not ask for any
                            concessions. Bulgaria wants to trade as equal partners. How this can be
                            achieved, whether through legislative action or otherwise, is up to the
                            US Government and not to Bulgaria. The Bulgarian people feel no guilt,
                            and ask for no concessions from the US. Bulgaria is an independent state
                            and can trade with anyone. It is up to the US to decide whether it wants
                            to trade with Bulgaria. Bulgaria wants to be friendly.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BI1">Bashev</persName> said “I am not angry. I am
                            just stating the facts. On the basis of equal footing and improvement in
                            trade, Bulgaria is willing to improve relations with the US. Until then,
                            there can be no change in US-Bulgarian relations. Bulgaria is ready to
                            see deeds on the US part to substantiate its declarations.”</p>

                            position. He could only tell me of the Foreign Ministry's views. He said
                            they were deeply concerned; also that the Bulgarian people are very much
                            concerned about American actions in Southeast Asia. He repeated sadly
                            that they were deeply concerned.</p>
                        <p>I said we were acting to put down aggression. I pointed out that American
                            ships had been attacked on the high seas and that the US had every right
                            to repulse the attack and defend itself.</p>

                        <p>Here <persName corresp="#p_BI1">Bashev</persName> shook his head, sadly.
                            He said this was dangerous to world peace and that the responsibility
                            was entirely in the hands of the US Government. “The recent action by
                            the US Government refutes the previous declaration made by President

                            important than declarations. The action against the North Vietnamese
                            villages (sic) was in contradiction to, and refuted, US declarations
                            about democracy, humanity and justice, he claimed.</p>
                        <p>I said we were only living up to our agreements by helping Vietnam to
                            maintain its independence. Further, I said, we would always defend
                            ourselves when attacked, but we hoped not to widen the conflict.</p>

                        <p>The Minister mentioned several recent developments which he believed
                            clearly showed Bulgarian intentions to improve relations. His Government
                            recently agreed to a limited cultural exchange in the field of English
                            teaching and in principle to the negotiation of a consular convention.
                            These developments were helpful, he believed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary had certain comments to make. We were, of course, also
                            interested in improving US-Bulgarian relations. We were prepared to make
                            efforts in that direction in connection with both small and large <pb
                                n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0150"/>questions involved. However, he
                            wanted to emphasize strongly that the starting point must be the
                            observance of the minimum rights of legations worked out by diplomacy
                            over several hundred years. If these rights are not fully respected, it
                            is difficult to make an effort for the improvement of relations. We are
                            seriously concerned that our Legation has been attacked for the third
                            time in two years. We feel such matters very deeply. These attacks also
                            create political problems in the U.S. Such actions tend to proscribe our
                            freedom of action to improve relations. Even if we have different views
                            on serious and dangerous questions, we cannot permit these differences
                            of opinion to erode generally accepted diplomatic practices. Otherwise
                            the whole fabric of diplomatic life falls to pieces. We hope the
                            Bulgarian Government will do everything in its power to protect the
                            rights of our Legation in Sofia. The Secretary said he had not used
                            violent language or excessive adjectives in his discussion, but this
                            does not make the problem any less serious. Having said that, he
                            continued that we are interested in improving relations—not for any
                            undisclosed or for any cold war reason—but we do believe that peoples
                            with different social systems should find ways to reduce and eliminate
                            difficulties whenever possible. We want to put relations between peoples
                            on an accepted normal basis if the situation permits.</p>
                        <p>The Minister had a few comments relative to the demonstration on February
                            15. In this latest incident the Foreign Minister took the initiative to
                            call in the US Charge to express regrets. Steps were taken to protect
                            our Legation. The Secretary should be aware of these facts.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented there was another problem which he must mention.
                            The activities of the militia near our Legation in Sofia are a source of
                            concern to us. He wished to urge that the rights of the Legation be of
                            particular concern to both sides. Problems of this kind should not be
                            allowed to arise.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister welcomed Mr. <persName>Davis</persName> and stated
                            that unfortunately in the relationship between the United States and
                            Bulgaria, ninety-nine per cent depended upon the Department of State and
                            only one per cent depended upon Bulgaria; but that that one per cent
                            consisted of good will and good faith. The Minister said that the Prime
                            Minister is too modest in his assessment, to which the latter replied he
                            is a realist, that 35 years of party and Komsomol work had taught him to
                            become a realist. He added that he was not speaking the language of
                            diplomacy, that he talks straightforward and plain language. He stated
                            that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_AHE1">Anderson</persName> started out
                            speaking to him in diplomatic language but that he wanted to talk with
                            her in human terms which they then did. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1"
                                >Zhivkov</persName> added that he had been very pleased with his
                            talks with Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_AHE1">Anderson</persName>, that he
                            liked her personally and that he would like to send his regards to her.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> asked how the Minister
                            liked his experience in Bulgaria—a Communist State. The Minister said
                            that this was already the third country in Eastern Europe in which he
                            had served and that therefore the area was not new to him. In reply to
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName>'s question, the
                            Minister stated that he had served in Czechoslovakia and the USSR, to
                            which <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> retorted that these
                            are the “classical countries of socialism” that they are “developed
                            countries” whereas “we are poor”. The Minister answered that he felt
                            that Bulgaria was developing industrially very quickly, that he had seen
                            some of the new industrial plants and was impressed and that the
                            statistics show how quickly Bulgaria is developing its industry.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then stated that he was here in order to improve relations
                            with Bulgaria; and that he did not consider for a moment that this
                            improvement of relationship must be at the expense of Bulgarian
                            relationships with the Soviet Union. He assured the Prime Minister that
                            we understood this perfectly well. We know that the Soviet Union has
                            given <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0152"/>Bulgaria great
                            assistance, that there are close historical and ideological ties between
                            Bulgaria and the USSR. He stated that our relations with Bulgaria cannot
                            possibly be as close as those of Bulgaria with the Soviet Union. It is
                            not our objective to interfere with these close relationships. We are
                            located far away, whereas the Soviet Union is a close neighbor of
                            Bulgaria. We realize that Bulgarian-Soviet relationships will be
                            primary. But on the positive side, the Minister continued, there is no
                            historical or other fundamental reason which should prevent us from
                            having good relations with Bulgaria. Our historic contacts have been
                            constructive. Just as Bulgaria has improved its relationships with other
                            countries, we have the same objectives. These are modest objectives but
                            they are real.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then stated that he particularly was anxious to improve
                            communications—contacts between the Bulgarian Government and the
                            Legation. We want to know what they consider to be problems and we want
                            to discuss how we can solve them. The Minister felt that there had not
                            been enough real effort to solve mutual problems. We should break out of
                            isolation from each other. The Minister assured the Prime Minister that
                            although he obviously does not control all U.S. policies it is his
                            desire and the desire of our Government to find ways to lessen problems.
                            Some problems have already been solved and he hopes to be able to solve
                            more. He asked <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> whether
                            there are any problems concerning our relationships which he should try
                            to work on.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> replied that he welcomed
                            the Minister's words especially in regard to maintaining contacts and
                            solving problems. What the Minister said about improvement of relations
                            not being at the expense of the United States-Soviet relationship is of
                            course true. The U.S. should have no illusions on this. He, <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName>, would not be in his present
                            position if it were otherwise.</p>
                        <p>In speaking about our mutual relationships, <persName corresp="#p_ZT1"
                                >Zhivkov</persName> continued, he must revert to Mrs. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AHE1">Anderson</persName>'s time and even before—to
                            World War II. Our major problems are that the United States
                            discriminates politically and economically against Bulgaria. The
                            Department of State must take the first step to eliminate this
                            discrimination, and no improvement in our relationships can take place
                            until the U.S. has stopped discrimination, especially in trade. If the
                            U.S. cannot stop discrimination completely it should at least take steps
                            which lead toward the end of discrimination. There are, of course, also
                            international problems, primarily Vietnam, which hamper our
                            relationships. We can improve our cultural relationships and contacts
                            but the real essence of our relationship depends on the end of U.S.
                            discrimination. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> said that
                            he felt that he did not need to develop this subject in theoretical
                            terms, that he could speak practically. He stated that their relations
                            have improved with those states which do not discriminate against them
                            politically and economically even though they have other social systems.
                            He cited examples—England, <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0153"
                            />France, Italy and Belgium. He went on to state that even with West
                            Germany their relationship is “normal”. He stated he is satisfied with
                            Bulgaria's relations with West Germany and they can “live together”. But
                            with the United States they are not satisfactory. He felt that they will
                            not improve for a long time. He said, speaking frankly, Bulgaria cannot
                            expect to stop the U.S. from conducting political discrimination against
                            it but the U.S. can improve economic relationships by lifting tariff
                            restrictions, at least in part. Once this problem is solved we can
                            discuss other matters such as cultural relationships. He stated that he
                            talked about cultural relations with Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_AHE1"
                                >Anderson</persName> often; they had sent the Kutev Ensemble to the
                            United States, but American newspapers then wrote that every third
                            member of the Kutev Ensemble was a spy. Anyhow, he stated, Bulgaria is
                            prepared to exchange cultural attractions. Again however, the key to
                            elementary good relations is the question of discrimination. He said
                            that with the British Bulgaria has perfectly normal relations even
                            though Great Britain is a capitalist country and Bulgaria is a socialist
                            country. But there is no discrimination. There are certain difficulties
                            and even Bulgaria imposes certain restrictions on trade but there is no
                            discrimination.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> then changed the subject
                            and asked whether the Minister had ever had a Prime Minister talk to him
                            in these frank terms, to which the Minister replied that this was his
                            first post as Chief of Mission.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> then made a reference to
                            the fact that their counter-espionage expenses are getting higher and
                            higher here. The Minister interjected that he felt that perhaps their
                            expenses for counter-espionage could be reduced and referred to one of
                            our principal concerns, namely the question of free access to the
                            Legation. He stated that we too feel that we are being discriminated
                            against in this respect; that he wants to be able to carry out the
                            regular, accepted business of the Legation, and we are not able to carry
                            out normal business as long as access to the Legation is restricted. He
                            added that we need good will on both sides in improving relationships;
                            that it was his desire to bring good will from the United States; that
                            his objective is to solve these problems. The Minister continued that he
                            also desires better economic relationships between Bulgaria and the
                            United States, but that he cannot agree that only one per cent is the
                            responsibility of Bulgaria. The Minister continued that he had a
                            fruitful discussion with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BI1"
                                >Bashev</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d31fn2">Reported in airgram
                                A–33 from Sofia, July 23. (Ibid.)</note> He was gratified that
                                <persName corresp="#p_BI1">Bashev</persName> had told him that they
                            are trying to resolve outstanding questions. On our side, the Minister
                            stated, he will do his utmost to resolve the question regarding tariffs
                            and other problems which have already been raised or will be raised in
                            the future. The Minister stated that the Secretary had told both
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_PL1">Popov</persName> during the latter's
                            farewell call<note n="3" xml:id="d31fn3">A memorandum of their August 30

                                >Gerasimov</persName>'s introductory call<note n="4" xml:id="d31fn4"
                                >A memorandum of their August 12 conversation is ibid., POL 17–5
                                BUL–US.</note> that we desire improvement in economic relationships
                            and that the Administration intends to ask the Congress to pass
                            legislation to increase the flow of peaceful trade, which would include
                            dealing with the question of tariffs. The Minister underlined that the
                            Bulgarian Government must understand we cannot change our tariff policy
                            without changing the law. In the meantime, however, the Legation would
                            do its utmost to facilitate trade. The Minister continued that there are
                            minor questions which serve as irritants to U.S.-Bulgarian relationships
                            and that some of these have already been solved as for instance the
                            question of U.S. importation of raw silk and silk waste. (At this point
                            Mr. <persName>Grozev</persName> explained to the Prime Minister what the
                            silk issue was and confirmed that it had been solved. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> obviously did not know the facts
                            in this issue.)</p>
                        <p>The Minister said he did not wish to exaggerate that we can solve all
                            problems one after the other, but that we will do our best.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> stated what Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_BI1">Bashev</persName> had told the
                            Minister represented Bulgarian Government policy. He wanted to add that
                            if he felt that the U.S. can change its policy towards Bulgaria even
                            partially, he would take such a change at face value. He added that
                            Bulgaria too wants to improve relationships but he felt that Bulgaria
                            would be the last country in Eastern Europe with which the United States
                            wanted to improve relations.</p>
                        <p>The Minister asked why. The Prime Minister replied that he spoke from
                            profound experience. Bulgaria was not important to U.S. policies or to
                            U.S. economic interests. He stated that he knew that Bulgaria was
                            considered by the United States to be “the closest satellite” of the
                            Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The Minister replied that our desire to improve relations with Bulgaria
                            was quite apart from the question whether Bulgaria was what the Prime
                            Minister referred to as the Soviet Union's closest satellite. We feel
                            that an improvement of relationships is possible completely apart from
                            Soviet-Bulgarian relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> replied that he also
                            thought so, but as he had told Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_AHE1"
                                >Anderson</persName>, he felt that the Department of State
                            completely underestimates Bulgaria's position in the heart of the Balkan
                            peninsula. He thought that relationships with Turkey and Greece had
                            improved and that these two countries were realistic in assessing
                            correctly Bulgaria's importance in the Balkans. He mentioned
                            particularly that Greek and Turkish tourism to Western Europe would not
                            be possible without Bulgaria since all major roads lead through
                            Bulgaria. He stated again that Turkey and Greece base their
                            relationships with Bulgaria on realism—on <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127"
                                facs="0155"/>the fact that Bulgaria is in the center of the
                            Balkans—but that the Department does not understand this. It wants to
                            move “through the back door”. He stated that relationships must be
                            improved through “the main entrance” and not through the back door. The
                            Minister replied that he did not know what <persName corresp="#p_ZT1"
                                >Zhivkov</persName> was talking about, that he himself was speaking
                            only about “the front door” through which he entered when he came to
                            visit the Prime Minister. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName>
                            replied that he was not talking about the Minister but was speaking
                            about U.S. tactics and strategy of policy.</p>
                        <p>The Minister again reiterated we wish to improve relations in an open and
                            straightforward way. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName>
                            replied that this is his first meeting with the Minister and that what
                            will follow from now on is important. He stated that, in regard to
                            access to the Legation, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_AHE1"
                                >Anderson</persName> had complained to him about the same subject
                            and that he had asked for a report. He claimed that access to the
                            Legation is free. The competent authorities denied to him that they
                            interfered with access and that militiamen stationed in front of the
                            entrance are only there to “guide citizens” who wanted to enter and to
                            be helpful. <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> stated that
                            perhaps they had been overdoing this, to which the Minister replied that
                            he hoped the Prime Minister would interest himself in this question and
                            help to ensure that they would not overdo their duty.</p>
                        <p>In closing the meeting, the Minister expressed to the Prime Minister his
                            appreciation for the assistance which the Foreign Ministry had given
                            him, in particular, Mr. <persName>Grozev</persName>, with special
                            reference to the Minister's radio-TV appearance on July 4.</p>
                        <p>The conversation lasted approximately 55 minutes and was conducted
                            throughout in a relaxed manner on the Prime Minister's part verging from
                            time to time almost on the jovial.</p>

                        <p>Relations between Bulgaria and the United States have improved. They are
                            reminiscent, however, of the first smiles one gets from a few-months-old

                                    there has been some in 1965. The regime's new economic theses
                                    give greater autonomy to individual enterprises. Although the
                                    reform leaves numerous strings available to an economically
                                    jittery regime, it places Bulgaria among the moderately
                                    progressive regimes of Eastern Europe—according to an <gloss

                                    Czechoslovakia and somewhat ahead of the USSR, Poland and East
                                    Germany. Since last spring the regime has allowed private
                                    craftsmen to engage in business more freely. If the regime holds
                                    prices steady, the wage hikes announced at the end of the year
                                    may help the population. The presence in Bulgaria during 1965 of
                                    a million foreign tourists—equivalent to one-eighth the
                                    population of the country—has had an impact. Reportedly foreign
                                    tourists were put up in 1,500 private homes in Sofia; Western
                                    newspapers were available in Black Sea resorts; a rent-a-car
                                    service was established; etc. The regime exhorts its citizens to
                                    caution, but the Bulgarians' desire for the economic <pb n="129"

                                    force some acceptance of increased contact with the West. So,

                                <p>There have been a few other signs: a satirical political review
                                    last summer, a few more political jokes on the radio, two or
                                    three mildly “daring” plays during the past couple of seasons,
                                    comments by foreign visitors over the past year or two about

                                        22, 1965, the Bulgarian press reported that the Bulgarian
                                        Government had uncovered and defeated a plot led by a senior
                                        Communist Party official and the commander of the Sofia
                                        military garrison.</note> does not seem to have reversed
                                    this cautious, unconfident inching liberalization. The plot
                                    seems to have been more episode than earthquake. Apparently the
                                    plotters wished to move closer to the Yugoslav example.
                                    Apparently they inspired considerable popular sympathy.
                                    Apparently they were poorly organized. The regime tried to play
                                    down the affair, giving light sentences. In its wake, the
                                    security organs were reorganized and party control within the
                                    army was tightened. The security forces in Bulgaria are probably
                                    now even more closely coordinated with the Soviets than before
                                    and enjoy the technical sophistication which this support
                                    implies. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZT1"

                                    year ago we reported that the Bulgarian leadership had given “no

                                    nearby Rumania had any appeal whatsoever.” The generality of
                                    Bulgaria's satellite status still holds, but one has to be a
                                    trifle less categorical. The Bulgarian effort to improve
                                    relations with Yugoslavia and Rumania has produced some verbal
                                    movement. In successive joint communiqués with <persName

                                    nationalistic elements have a peg on which to hang their

                                    affinity to the Soviet Union, her economic situation ties her to

                                    phrase, “in life and death.” With two billion dollars in Soviet
                                    credits since World War II, Bulgaria is industrializing—having
                                    climbed from an industrial production representing 15% of the
                                    total in 1939 to over 50% at the present time. Bulgaria will
                                    soon be importing over 40% of her expanding energy needs—mostly
                                    from the USSR. Bulgaria's foreign trade is 50% with the Soviet
                                    Union and, even in the other direction, Bulgaria ranks as the
                                    USSR's fourth largest trading partner.</p>

                                    German regime, the Bulgarian Communists need USSR support to
                                    stay afloat. There are a few signs that Bulgaria may be playing

                                    this trend. Bulgaria is trying to branch out, and even has a few

                                    Bulgarian Government has made an effort, albeit with lapses, to
                                    develop more cordial political, cultural and economic relations
                                    with France, Italy, the Benelux countries and Great Britain,
                                    probably in that order. Trade and tourism from West Germany
                                    produce an impressive balance of about 40 million dollars in
                                    each direction. However, Bulgaria faces an uphill struggle in
                                    trade with the West, as it must sell more and more
                                    non-agricultural products as its economy changes and expands. If
                                    Bulgaria's trade with the West fails to grow apace, Bulgaria

                                    <hi rend="italic">Relations with the United States</hi>. A year
                                    ago it looked as if there was no way to go but up. Our year-end
                                    assessment spoke of “a hardened <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131"
                                        facs="0159"/>Bulgarian attitude“, inactivity, stagnation,
                                    dwindling contacts, increased police operations against the
                                    Legation, the manhandling of US personnel on three occasions,
                                    minimized US-Bulgarian contact, pressure to extend closed zones,
                                    and the second assault in a year on the Chancery.</p>
                                <p>If anything, the first months of this year saw movement further
                                    down. The Bulgarians reacted to the extension of the Vietnamese
                                    War with still another assault on the Legation offices and, for
                                    the first time, on the Residence. The early months of 1965 also
                                    saw imposition of still further travel controls, violently
                                    offensive anti-American propaganda in the windows next to the
                                    Legation (including exultation over American soldiers' coffins)
                                    and the rejection of cultural exchanges.</p>
                                <p>After a probable low point early this spring, relations appear to
                                    have slowly improved. It might be added that the Bulgarians have
                                    been excruciatingly cautious in any moves that might be
                                    described as constructive. Why? First, there is the Soviet tie
                                    and America's role as the Socialist Camp's great enemy. There is
                                    the ten year hiatus in American-Bulgarian relations and their
                                    legacy of suspicion. Moreover, other Western diplomats note a
                                    general Bulgarian passivity and inertia, perhaps a result of
                                    long-standing isolation and backwardness. The Bulgarians may not
                                    be advanced enough to sense and appreciate their need of contact
                                    with the West. They may be afraid of it—like the eminent
                                    Bulgarian solid-state physicist who recently came to America as
                                    an exchangee and found he was at “graduate-student level.” While
                                    the Bulgarians desire Western embassies here, they would like
                                    them to nestle like parsley—decorative and irrelevant.</p>
                                <p>What signs of movement have there been? There has been no
                                    repetition of the destructive attacks on the Legation since last
                                    February—the longest period without them since 1963. There has
                                    been a resumption of more normal—for a Communist
                                    country—official and social contact between Bulgarians and
                                    Legation personnel. (Last November Legation officers hosted 14
                                    occasions at which 58 Bulgarians attended.) Access to Bulgarian
                                    officials, including the Prime Minister, has been facilitated.
                                    The police “blockade” of the American Legation offices has been
                                    mitigated, although intimidation and post visit interrogation no
                                    doubt continue. Casual visitors—the man who saw his daughter's
                                    picture in our window, the woman who wants to buy a Christmas
                                    card, or the student who wants to borrow a book—have increased
                                    from virtually none to one or two a day.</p>
                                <p>In the past year the consular business of the Legation has
                                    doubled (citizenship cases from 24 to 65, immigrant visas from 7
                                    to 17, and non-immigrant visas from 123 to 321). The Bulgarians
                                    gave agreement in principle early in the year to negotiate a
                                    Consular Convention, although they have not yet followed
                                    through. In November and December the first <pb n="132"
                                        xml:id="pg_132" facs="0160"/>of two of some 18 hardship visa
                                    and citizenship cases were moved toward solution.</p>
                                <p>In the economic field, the first substantial Bulgarian deals with
                                    American firms and their European affiliates were made. These
                                    included a 15 million dollar contract with the French Schneider
                                    group of which about half will go to Litwin and Standard Oil of
                                    Ohio. This will also bring to Bulgaria the first supervising
                                    American engineers since the War. Other contracts include a
                                    Coca-Cola plant, and the renovation of some tobacco
                                    factories—bringing American Machine and Foundry about two
                                    million dollars. The year 1965 also saw the first American
                                    chartered aircraft bringing tourists to Varna, and the first
                                    Bulgarian merchant ship calling at a U.S. port.</p>
                                <p>In the public affairs and exchanges field, there has been some
                                    motion. Exchanges have worked out in the field of English
                                    teaching, medicine and agriculture. The Bulgarians have
                                    expressed interest in a library science exchange. The exchange
                                    program between the Inter-University Committee on Travel Grants
                                    and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences is continuing. The
                                    Bulgarians have arranged substantive programs for such diverse
                                    visitors as composer <persName>Peter Mennin</persName>, poet
                                        <persName>William Snodgrass</persName> and Judge
                                        <persName>William Henry. A</persName> number of American
                                    journalists have come, with a Sulzberger interview with
                                        <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName>, a similar
                                    offer to Daniel Schorr (he declined because, on checking, he
                                    found it probably wouldn't be used on CBS) and the first direct
                                    American news broadcast from Bulgaria in recent years by Ed
                                    Morgan (for technical reasons, of unusable quality). Radio Sofia
                                    used <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> materials (without
                                    attribution) for the first time and the Bulgarian authorities,
                                    after some back and forth, permitted the American Minister to go
                                    on nation-wide radio-TV on July 4, as Mrs. <persName

                                <p>Vituperative anti-American window displays next to the Legation
                                    have not been in evidence for the past three months, contrary to
                                    previous practice. The Bulgarians have not interfered with the
                                    expanding circulation of the Legation's Bulgarian language <hi
                                        rend="italic">Cultural Bulletin</hi>—now up from 1,000 to
                                    2,000 copies. The Bulgarians also did not obstruct a lecture
                                    this month in the Legation's ground floor library—the first time
                                    the library has been put to this use since November 1964. The
                                    Bulgarians have not so far interfered with the initial mailing
                                    of the Legation's new Bulgarian <hi rend="italic">Science
                                        Bulletin</hi>, the first issue of which was put out this

                                <p>The Bulgarians have offered us a good site for the 1966 Plovdiv
                                    Fair. The Legation's expanded book presentation program has not
                                    been impeded; and a gift of books to the National Library
                                    resulted in an exhibit of the gift books in the library's
                                    permanent exhibit hall. There has been no instance since last
                                    spring of an announced exchange being canceled, although two
                                    American exhibit proposals were rejected on the flimsiest of
                                    excuses. The Bulgarians have been unresponsive to American <pb

                                of <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 304, the past year has seen
                                cautious movement toward internal liberalization, a continuance of
                                Bulgaria's satellite role, and some progress in re-association with
                                the West and the United States in particular. Bulgaria is not
                                totally among-the-missing in East Europe's “quiet revolution“; but
                                it is among the most quiet, and among the least daring. The mounting
                                gravity of the Vietnam War provides something between an excuse and
                                a reason for Bulgaria's caution and negativism. A certain passivity
                                and harvest of isolation were added brakes.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Actually, Bulgaria's conservatism has had some positive results. It is an
                            interesting incidental fact that Bulgaria's collective farmers still
                            legally own their own land. Bulgaria never did a root and branch Marxist
                            revision of its English language textbooks. Bulgaria never renamed
                                <persName>George</persName> Washington Street in Sofia or Franklin
                            Roosevelt Street in Plovdiv, never came under Article 19 of the U.N.
                            Charter, never imposed a ceiling on American diplomatic staffs, and
                            never instituted a system of prior travel notification for attaches or
                            others. It settled its outstanding financial claims with us, and does
                            not stand afoul of the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                            Act. It adheres to the Berne Copyright Union, and only this year
                            ratified outstanding revisions to the Paris Convention for the
                            Protection of Industrial Property.</p>
                        <p>Assuming that in the future the trend continues up, we envisage two
                            phases of development in our relations. In the first phase we shall
                            continue to seek progress towards a Consular Convention, resolution of
                            outstanding citizenship and visa cases, progressively freer access to
                            our offices, continued protection of the Legation, expanded official and
                            social contact and increased exchanges. On all these counts there has
                            been progress in 1965, but not a complete resolution. Our request for
                            reciprocal radio rights, a moderation of anti-American propaganda next
                            to the Legation, and multiple entry diplomatic visas fall into this
                            “Phase I” category.</p>
                        <p>When both sides are ready for larger steps, we may hope to turn to a
                            cessation of <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> jamming, a
                            substantially more ambitious exchange and public affairs program, the
                            introduction of American newspapers, a general moderation of
                            anti-American propaganda, reciprocal reduction of travel restrictions,
                            and closer Bulgarian adherence to general norms of international dealing
                            in trade and other fields. Among the things America can offer is Most
                            Favored Nation treatment, greater cooperation in trade, review of our
                            attitude toward <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 and credit; and
                            possible elevation of the status of the two countries' missions. Of all
                            these possibilities, <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> is what the
                            Bulgarians really want most from us. Our success with the East-West

                                xml:id="pg_134" facs="0162"/>relations with this country. Whether or
                            not we decide ultimately to negotiate with Bulgaria regarding <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>, the fate of the bill in Congress will
                            greatly influence the psychological atmosphere here.</p>
                        <p>Our opportunities may be greatest at present on the psychological front.
                            We believe expansion of exchanges in both directions is to our advantage
                            as a stimulant to meaningful contact and means of impact. In the
                            exchange field, the Bulgarians have been passive, reluctant and
                            disorganized. But we, too, need a more positive attitude, more vigor,
                            more interest and more willingness to give deft leadership to the U.S.
                            private sector. In another context, Freud once said that the lines of
                            cleavage are in every crystal, but you don't see them until the crystal
                            breaks. We must apply our wedges where we can; and chip away at
                            Bulgarian backwardness, isolation, and fear.</p>

                                airgram A–498, April 22. (Ibid., POL 17–1 US–BUL)</note> He was
                            pleased that Chairman Traykov had made the statement that Bulgaria was
                            ready to do what it can to improve relations between the two countries
                            within the framework of the present situation.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MSJM1">McSweeney</persName> noted that he
                            and Minister <persName corresp="#p_GL1">Gerasimov</persName> had found
                            they were in general agreement that there were two main areas in our
                            bilateral relations where some concrete progress had been made and can
                            be made in the future. The first was in the field of trade. He felt that
                            it would not be useful on this occasion to delve into the history of our
                            trade relations, the historical background of the question the
                            Bulgarians referred to as “discrimination” in trade, nor into the
                            details of our legislative processes. He merely wanted to mention those
                            things that had been done which he felt would have a favorable impact on
                            our trade relations.</p>
                        <p>First was the President's proposal of the East-West Trade Bill to the
                            Congress which would give him the discretionary authority to extend
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> to all the countries of Eastern
                            Europe. This bill was not considered in the Congress at the last
                            session, but it will be introduced for consideration in the next
                            session. Minister <persName corresp="#p_MSJM1">McSweeney</persName>
                            recalled that Senator Magnuson, during his conversation with the Prime
                                Minister,<note n="3" xml:id="d33fn3">Senator Magnuson visited
                                Bulgaria September 27–30 as President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                                    >Johnson</persName>'s representative to the Plovdiv Fair, which
                                was held September 15–October 2. He met with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> on September 28. A
                                memorandum of their conversation was transmitted as an attachment to
                                airgram A–127, October 11. (Ibid., LEG 7 Magnuson)</note> had voiced
                            his strong support for this bill. Secondly, the US had extended a $10
                            million <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> credit for Bulgarian
                            purchases of feed grains. Thirdly, the President had made an important
                            speech on October 7, 1966, which concerned itself with relations with
                            Eastern Europe in which he again voiced his desire to improve these
                                relations.<note n="4" xml:id="d33fn4">For text of the speech, see
                                    <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United

                            Toward that end the Commerce Department had removed some 400 items from
                            the list of strategic commodities for which licenses had previously to
                            be obtained; and the President, with the support of the Congress,
                            extended Ex-Im Bank guarantees to those countries in Eastern Europe
                            which had not had these previously. Further he had expressed his
                            determination to press for enactment of the East-West trade legislation.
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_MSJM1">McSweeney</persName> said these
                            are facts which, if they do not give all that one might want to improve
                            our trade relations, were certainly concrete indications of the
                            direction in which the US is moving.</p>
                        <p>The second broad area, Minister <persName corresp="#p_MSJM1"
                                >McSweeney</persName> stated, in which he thought we could expand
                            our mutual relationship was in cultural <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136"
                                facs="0164"/>exchanges—the exchange of people, information and ideas
                            in order to spread the knowledge of our respective countries and people.
                            He was pleased to note, Minister <persName corresp="#p_MSJM1"
                                >McSweeney</persName> continued, that there had also been some
                            progress in exchanges in both directions to which the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB1">GOB</gloss> had contributed. Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSJM1">McSweeney</persName> mentioned the Electric Power
                                Delegation,<note n="5" xml:id="d33fn5">This visit has not been
                                identified.</note> the visit of Senator Magnuson, the visit of the
                            US Trade Delegation,<note n="6" xml:id="d33fn6">October 1–15.</note> US
                            participation in the Plovdiv Fair and Bulgarian assistance in obtaining
                            exit visas for a number of hardship cases as evidence of this forward
                            movement. He stated that he did not want to go into detail, that he
                            hoped to have discussions on various matters with the respective
                            officials of the Bulgarian Government, that he hoped to contribute to
                            progress in our bilateral relations, and that he hoped for Chairman
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName>'s support.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> first
                            proposed a toast wishing the Minister a successful mission in Bulgaria.
                            He stated that the <gloss target="#t_GOB1">GOB</gloss> understands the
                            steps that have been taken so far and that the <gloss target="#t_GOB1"
                                >GOB</gloss> will respond positively to any American initiative. He
                            felt, however, that US-Bulgarian relations were now in a cul-de-sac,
                            that they were not developing properly but marking time. He stated that
                            Bulgaria had developed its relations with Britain, France, Italy, Japan
                            and Austria but not with the US. He asked who was responsible for this
                            situation—the United States or Bulgaria? He stated that perhaps both
                            sides were responsible, and that both sides would nave to make mutual
                            concessions with the aim of finding solutions to their problems. He said
                            that he is not an optimist but a “rough realist” and that perhaps for
                            this reason he was ill-chosen to be a Prime Minister. However, he
                            stated, the Minister can count on his and his Government's support in
                            any effort to improve bilateral relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> stated that on the subject
                            of Vietnam, Bulgaria would continue to voice its position that the
                            United States is committing aggression against a fraternal socialist
                            country. Bulgaria would state this position at the upcoming Party
                            Congress and on other appropriate occasions, but, <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> continued, Bulgaria takes
                            account of the “actual situation” and will respond positively to any
                            initiatives from the US in the bilateral field. He stated that he had
                            spoken with many people inside and outside of Bulgaria and he follows
                            the area of foreign relations closely. He reiterated that any positive
                            steps by the US will be welcome and will be reciprocated by Bulgaria. He
                            cautioned, however, that if both sides were to view the future through
                            “rose-colored glasses,” they would fail to improve relations. They must
                            view the relationship by considering concrete things—“what can be done.”
                            He stated that he had a mandate both from the Central Committee of the
                                <gloss target="#t_BCP1">BCP</gloss> and the Government to respond
                                <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0165"/>to US initiatives and he
                            would do so immediately. He then asked what can we do concretely right
                            away? Can the US extend credits?</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MSJM1">McSweeney</persName> stated that
                            Bulgaria had an outstanding credit line of $10 million for feed grains
                            right now and that Ex-Im Bank guarantees also were available now for all
                            countries in Eastern Europe. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZT1"
                                >Zhivkov</persName> asked whether Bulgaria could get immediate
                            credit to buy either complete plants or to engage in a barter deal
                            whereby they would purchase plants or equipment and pay in kind. He
                            stated that in matters like this <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> is
                            not of primary importance to Bulgaria but that he is interested in
                            reaching concrete decisions.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MSJM1">McSweeney</persName> replied that
                            there recently had been a number of representatives of leading New York
                            banks in Sofia who had offered to extend credit lines. This was an
                            indication of the American private sector's belief that things were
                            moving forward. He continued by saying that we would probably have to
                            start on a small scale since our problems in this field are of long
                            standing, but that the US is prepared to consider proposals as they come
                            up.</p>
                        <p>On the subject of Vietnam, Minster <persName corresp="#p_MSJM1"
                                >McSweeney</persName> stated, our views are obviously different, and
                            he would not try to convince Chairman <persName corresp="#p_ZT1"
                                >Zhivkov</persName> at the present meeting that the US is right. He
                            expected the <gloss target="#t_GOB1">GOB</gloss> to continue to express
                            its views on the subject. And he realized that the Chairman is well
                            informed about international developments, but he wanted to recommend a
                            careful reading of the communiqué of the Manila Conference.<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d33fn7">For text of the communiqué, released on October 25,
                                see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
                                    1966</hi>, pp. 867–871.</note> It had been previously suggested
                            that the American Government had been seeking something for itself in
                            Vietnam. The communiqué shows clearly that the US wants to settle the
                            problem and, as a practical step, is prepared to evacuate its military
                            personnel within six months if the other side does the same. Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSJM1">McSweeney</persName> stated that to the
                            extent that Chairman <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> can
                            use his influence to have the other side look at this proposal
                            seriously, this would help efforts to achieve peace. Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSJM1">McSweeney</persName> emphasized that our
                            readiness to withdraw is a fact. Mutual withdrawal can lead to a
                            reduction in the war and make a political solution possible.</p>
                        <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> stated he wanted
                            to emphasize that Bulgaria wishes to maintain normal relations—it is a
                            small country, but that it has an active foreign and internal policy. He
                            stated that it was in the mutual interest of both countries to have
                            normal relations. He believed that the main question is to end
                            “discrimination” starting with the economic field, and that after such
                            “discrimination” had ended, both countries could turn to other sectors.
                            He stated again that Bulgaria would welcome any steps on the part of the
                            US to improve relations and that his Government <pb n="138"
                                xml:id="pg_138" facs="0166"/>would respond positively. But, he
                            continued, the fact that the Department of State carries out
                            “discrimination” against Bulgaria in trade creates major difficulties.
                            He said that he cannot understand how cultural relations can be
                            developed unless a solution is found to the problem of economic
                            relations. He cited as an example that Bulgaria has more economic
                            relations with Spain than with the US in spite of the character of the
                            Spanish regime. He said that the US-Bulgarian dialogue had always
                            revolved around the same problems ever since he became Prime Minister.
                            “Discrimination” prevents establishing normal relations and interferes
                            with normal contacts between Bulgarian and US officials. Bulgaria, he
                            said, had no problems with France in spite of the fact that President
                            DeGaulle's view of the world is not its own. Bulgaria has wide trade
                            with West Germany although the two countries constantly insulted each
                            other. He said that Bulgaria does not worry about <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> making propaganda threats. The main
                            problem is the economic problem.</p>
                        <p>On the subject of Vietnam, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_ZT1"
                                >Zhivkov</persName> continued, the question is very complicated. US
                            bombardment must be stopped and then both sides can proceed to
                            negotiations. He stated that nobody told him to say this, but he wanted
                            to say anyway that the US should stop bombing and that would be the way
                            to bring about negotiations. If the Vietnam conflict were to grow it
                            would be a terrible business, he continued. He had just returned from
                            the Soviet Union where he had been shown the latest Soviet weapons and
                            he had been told that US weapons and Soviet weapons were very similar in
                            their characteristics and destructive capability. He said that he knew
                            what US weapons could do and what Soviet weapons could do, and that if
                            they were to come into contact with each other a catastrophe would
                            result. He said that this is absurd and reiterated that US should stop
                            its bombing whereafter talks could start.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MSJM1">McSweeney</persName> stated that
                            the US had stopped bombing twice, but there had been no response from
                            the other side. He said that a bomb is a bomb whether it is placed under
                            a railroad tie or dropped from the sky. He stated that if there were
                            some indication from the other side that it is prepared to reciprocate,
                            something could be accomplished immediately. He reiterated that there is
                            no one who wants to get the Vietnam conflict ended more than the US.</p>
                        <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> replied that US
                            propaganda states that North Vietnam has sent troops to the South. “It
                            is nothing like this,” he insisted. Bulgaria had recently had a
                            delegation in North Vietnam of which Mr. <persName>Grozev</persName> had
                            been a member. No North Vietnamese troops have been sent to South
                            Vietnam, he said. North Vietnam does give material assistance to the
                            South Vietnamese guerrilla forces, but this is a guerrilla war. As
                            evidence that there are no North Vietnamese units in South Vietnam and
                            that this is merely a guerrilla war, he cited the fact that not one town
                            had been taken by North Vietnamese troops in the South.</p>
                        <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0167"/>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MSJM1">McSweeney</persName> opined that
                            this may either be a matter of tactics or a measure of lack of success
                            of the North Vietnamese troops. He said that many North Vietnamese
                            prisoners in camps in South Vietnam are good evidence of North
                            Vietnamese direct participation. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_ZT1"
                                >Zhivkov</persName> then acknowledged that there may be individual
                            North Vietnamese helping in South Vietnam, but reasserted there are no
                            military units. But, he continued, it is neither his mandate nor the
                            Minister's mission to discuss this problem today.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MSJM1">McSweeney</persName> stated that
                            during his tour of duty with the Strategic Air Command over two years
                            ago he also had seen information about US and Soviet weapons similar to
                            that which Chairman <persName corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> had
                            evidently seen in the USSR. He stated that the US knows the dangers of
                            nuclear war full well and that therefore it wanted to see the Vietnam
                            problem resolved as quickly as possible.</p>
                        <p>On that note the conversation ended with repeated expressions of mutual
                            goodwill.</p>
                        <p>The conversation lasted approximately 45 minutes and was conducted in a
                            cordial and relaxed manner.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Guerassimov first apologized for not having been able to keep
                            the appointment he had requested with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1"
                                >Leddy</persName> on March 27. He explained that UN Permanent

                            March 27 and that he had to confer with Tarabanov before the latter's

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said that no change in
                            the basic foreign policy of the US should be expected. The President
                            said that he wanted to devote himself to working on the problems facing
                            the country without getting involved himself in the election campaign.
                            In respect to Viet Nam the President was going to try what many people
                            had urged—a halt to bombing—to see if the expectations would come true
                            that peace talks would start promptly and that no military advantage
                            would be taken. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName>
                            expressed the hope that persons on the side of Hanoi who had spoken
                            optimistically of what would happen if bombing were halted would now
                            exert their influence to make their predictions come true. Ambassador
                            Guerassimov said that perhaps Hanoi would want to delay any action to
                            see who the new President would be. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1"
                                >Leddy</persName> said that Hanoi would make a mistake if it decided
                            to await the inauguration of a new President before responding to the
                            bombing halt.</p>

                        <p>Noting that Bulgarian relations with Turkey had significantly improved
                            with the just concluded <persName>Zhivkov</persName> trip to Turkey, the

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Leddy</persName> replied that if the Ambassador wished a
                            detailed discussion on Greece, he should talk to Assistant Secretary
                            Battle within whose area Greece fell. Mr. <persName>Leddy</persName>
                            said that he was informed about Greece chiefly in the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> context. As the Ambassador might
                            guess, the US did not want to see Greece leave <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. The US did want to see Greece return to
                            constitutional government with traditional freedoms. The US did not feel
                            there was anything to be gained by cutting relations with the present
                            Greek government. Our policy was therefore to continue contacts, to
                            exert such influence as we could and to hope that in time,
                            constitutional government would be restored.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Guerassimov said that the present regime in Greece was
                            reminiscent of that which existed there prior to World War I and was
                            hindering the development of a better atmosphere in the Balkans.</p>

                            reciprocal radio rights and the ending of Bulgarian jamming of Voice of
                            America broadcasts. Ambassador Guerassimov said that the Embassy in
                            Washington was not involved in the consular convention negotiations but
                            that he would inform Sofia of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1"
                                >Leddy</persName>'s interest. He also said that he thought the US
                            Embassy in Sofia had received some information on the jamming question.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said that no
                            satisfactory information had been received on jamming. Ambassador
                            Guerassimov then brought up the recent reply of the Foreign Ministry to
                            the Department's note of July 27, 1967 reducing the number of counties

                            concerned, as there had always been criticism within the Party and the
                            replacement of no longer useful Party officials. He said that in his

                            <item>While the events in Czechoslovakia have clearly been unsettling to
                                the population and a burden to the regime, the effects are probably
                                somewhat less severe in Bulgaria than elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
                                Postwar Bulgarian history is unmarked by shock comparable to the
                                uprising in East Germany in 1953, the October events in Poland in
                                1956, and the Hungarian uprising of October 1956. Despite a degree
                                of liberalization <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0172"/>carried
                                out slowly since 1956, the regime has remained essentially
                                conservative and hence does not have to retreat very far now.
                                Geographically, economically and socially, Bulgaria is further
                                removed from the Czechoslovak events than any of the other four
                                Warsaw Pact countries. The majority of Bulgarians are decent enough
                                to regret what has happened in Czechoslovakia, but the intensity of
                                their identification with the Czechoslovak people is not
                                remarkable.</item>

                            <item>The regime is working along predictable lines to limit the damage
                                to its moral position and that of the Soviet Union arising from the
                                invasion. The plausibility of the arguments advanced is very low,
                                including heavy dependence on such conceptual slogans as
                                “machinations of Western imperialism.” Even Pavlovian conditioned
                                reactions should have difficulty with reference to “Morgans and
                                Duponts,” “Rockefeller and Franco” as somehow justifying use of
                                Communist tanks to combat Communist words and ideas. That the
                                Czechoslovak people as a whole sought to move away from the more
                                oppressive aspects of Soviet-style socialism is probably widely
                                accepted here. If, as we believe, large segments of Bulgarian public
                                are seriously depressed by Czech events, it is because they are seen
                                as harsh object lesson that any significant steps toward
                                liberalization will be forcefully repressed by Moscow as an
                                intolerable attempt to “restore capitalism and detach the country
                                from the camp of socialism.”</item>

                                    His purpose had been to give recognition to the Slovak uprising
                                    at the end of World War II (thus correcting earlier Soviet
                                    attitudes), and to encourage improvement in Czech-Slovak

                                        >Khrushchev</persName> following the latter's fall. This was

                                    was a presidential election in Prague on November 12,
                                        <persName>Novotny</persName> had no particular worry about

                                <p>
                                    <persName corresp="#p_VM1">Vejvoda</persName> was on the whole
                                    optimistic about the policies of the new Soviet leaders so far
                                    as his own country's interests were concerned, noting that
                                        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> was well
                                    known and liked in Prague. (<persName corresp="#p_VM1"
                                        >Vejvoda</persName> confirmed, incidentally, that Mrs.

                                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> were at
                                    Karlovy Vary at the time of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                        >Khrushchev</persName>'s ouster.) He did not think the
                                    recent promotion of Shelepin, former head of the <gloss
                                        target="#t_KGB1">KGB</gloss>, to be a full Presidium member
                                    was worrisome. He thought Shelepin had been put in to moderate
                                    the police. <persName corresp="#p_VM1">Vejvoda</persName>
                                    qualified his general optimism by some remarks about the
                                    possibility of Sino-Soviet accommodation, which he felt sure
                                    would occur if the US attempted to “isolate” the USSR. (This was
                                    evidently a reference to US policy on the UN financing
                                        issue.)<note n="4" xml:id="d38fn4">The Soviet Union insisted
                                        on its right to contribute only to U.N. activities of which
                                        it approved. The United States insisted that it pay its full
                                        assessed contribution.</note> Undertones of worry about a
                                    possible change in Soviet policy also appeared in a bantering
                                    reply to a question regarding Soviet intentions to ratify
                                    Charter amendments for the enlargement of UN Councils. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_VM1">Vejvoda</persName> said he thought the

                                    otherwise. He said Yugoslavia and Albania, for opposite reasons,
                                    were most worried about the implications of <persName

                            <item>In a discussion of Czech cultural developments, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_VM1">Vejvoda</persName> stressed the flourishing
                                experimental theater in Prague. Asked how the Party felt about this,
                                he stated that Party Secretary Koucky, who implements but does not
                                make policy in this field, tried to steer a middle course between
                                the beatniks and the dogmatists. He said the Prague theater was a
                                great attraction for West German tourists whom the Czechs welcome
                                    <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0177"/>for currency reasons
                                along with the Austrians who visit Brno and Bratislava on one day
                                trips. (<persName corresp="#p_VM1">Vejvoda</persName> denied that
                                many West Germans came to Czechoslovakia to meet East German
                                relatives, indicating that <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                                nationals were not in any case particularly welcome nor easily able
                                to leave East Germany.) Asked whether there would be a return flow
                                of Czech visitors to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and
                                Austria, <persName corresp="#p_VM1">Vejvoda</persName> expressed
                                doubt not, he said, because the Czechs feared defections but because
                                of their hard currency problem. This led him to remark that
                                defection was a tough personal problem for the individuals involved
                                but that for his part he wished that such individuals would think
                                not only about their own desires but also about the fact that every
                                defection caused the dogmatists at home to clamp down on those who
                                stay behind. The evolution toward greater intellectual scope and
                                freedom gets set back through such incidents.</item>

                            <item>Referring to <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss>, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_VM1">Vejvoda</persName> did not think it was going
                                anywhere very fast. He said that Czechoslovakia was the only country
                                that had really shown an interest in bloc integration efforts, along
                                with the Soviets, and that even Poland was dubious. He indicated the
                                Czechs were disenchanted with their forward role and would look
                                increasingly for trade relations with the West. He saw little future
                                in economic relations with the southeast European communist
                                countries. In connection with economic matters, he said that the
                                Czechs had suffered severely from the Sino-Soviet split because they
                                had lost one of their best markets, including that for their
                                inferior products, like second-rate shoes, which no-one but the
                                Chinese would take. He said the Chinese had been good trading
                                partners, delivering needed raw materials and even hard currency
                                punctually. <persName corresp="#p_VM1">Vejvoda</persName> observed
                                that the Czech man in the street was quite resentful of economic
                                assistance to African countries, which were poor credit risks. But
                                Cuba was popular both for romantic reasons and because it supplied
                                tropical fruit which were a luxury in a small landlocked country
                                like his own. <persName corresp="#p_VM1">Vejvoda</persName> did not
                                deny that there had been problems over economic relations with Cuba
                                but stressed that at the time of the 1962 missile crisis there had
                                been a lot of sympathy for Castro because he seemed to have suffered
                                the same fate as the Czechs did in 1938. <persName corresp="#p_VM1"
                                    >Vejvoda</persName> said he had always suspected that the whole
                                missile episode had been pre-arranged by the US and the USSR—a
                                notion on which he was strongly challenged.</item>

                                        >Khrushchev</persName>'s greatest failure. He had thought he
                                    had the power to get a free city but instead got himself into a
                                    military confrontation. The Czechs were especially bitter over
                                    this (despite their general approval of <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>) because it had
                                    obliged them to undertake a major mobilization, including

                                    the Wall, though he did not contradict a comment that of all the

                                    that even in the days when Czech propaganda heaped abuse on
                                    Adenauer, they had always indicated their interest in trade and
                                    normal relations.</p>

                            <item>Referring to the current visit here of a Czech writers' group
                                (whose itinerary, he said, the Czech travel organization had badly
                                bungled), <persName corresp="#p_VM1">Vejvoda</persName> mentioned
                                that some of the Jewish members of the group had sought to make
                                contact with Jewish writers here. He said anti-semitism was minimal
                                in Czechoslovakia, though at one time, after the war, anti-German
                                feeling had also been directed at German-speaking Jews. He pointed
                                out that Defense Minister Lomsky was Jewish and expressed his belief
                                that there was no discrimination against Jews so far as professional
                                and official jobs were concerned. He thought US “propaganda”
                                exaggerated anti-semitism in the USSR, though he admitted that it
                                did exist there historically. He did not think that Czech Jews had
                                ever attempted to urge the Soviets to curb anti-semitism.</item>

                            <item>In mentioning Lomsky, <persName corresp="#p_VM1"
                                    >Vejvoda</persName> got to talking about former Defense Minister
                                Svoboda who is now apparently the head of the military academy.
                                Svoboda was put to work as an accountant in a cooperative after
                                being purged in 1948. Some time later, <persName corresp="#p_VM1"
                                    >Vejvoda</persName> thought in 1952, a Soviet delegation came to
                                Prague and some of its members who had known Svoboda in the USSR
                                during the war asked about him rather insistently. Eventually the
                                Czech authorities agreed to produce him and sent an official to
                                Svoboda's apartment to locate him. He had Mrs.
                                    <persName>Svoboda</persName> pull out one of Svoboda's general's
                                uniforms and went off to the cooperative where he told Svoboda to
                                put on the uniform and go to meet his Soviet friends, but instructed
                                him not to mention his low estate. Svoboda performed as instructed
                                and thereafter was gradually rehabilitated.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_VM1">Vejvoda</persName> several times urged
                                the US to conduct an active policy of contacts with the east,
                                especially through trade and cultural exchange. He said US policy
                                could greatly affect the further development of Sino-Soviet
                                relations. He felt that most US officials had the correct attitude
                                toward Eastern Europe but that some still seemed to feel that the
                                East European countries could be split off from the USSR and their
                                communist <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0179"/>regimes removed.
                                This he said was unrealistic and the expression of views along these
                                lines hampered the development of relations. His attention was
                                called to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s
                                references to bridge-building and to the abiding US interest in
                                seeing greater independence and liberty come to the peoples of
                                Eastern Europe. The US considered the satellite status inflicted
                                upon the East Europeans after the war repugnant but had always
                                recognized the legitimate interest of the Soviets and East Europeans
                                in friendly relations with each other. <persName corresp="#p_VM1"
                                    >Vejvoda</persName> said that Czech-Soviet friendship was
                                traditional—even Benes had been accused of being a Communist because
                                of his desire for good relations with Moscow—and that there would
                                always be close relations.</item>

                                deplored the current impasse and expressed the view that the Soviets
                                would not pay up under pressure. Reminded that the US position was
                                not motivated by the desire to bring pressure on the Soviet Union
                                but by our view of the role of the UN, <persName corresp="#p_VM1"
                                    >Vejvoda</persName> acknowledged that the Soviets had missed
                                opportunities to avoid the present situation. He stressed that the
                                Soviets wished to preserve Security Council prerogatives in the
                                peacekeeping field and not to weaken them by accepting the system of
                                Assembly assessments for peacekeeping. He thought that the only hope
                                now was to act on Soviet suggestions for a working group to consider
                                future peacekeeping moral-ities while postponing a showdown. He was
                                again reminded that US proposals in this field had been on the table
                                since March and that Soviet responses had been utterly
                                uncompromising. It was suggested to him that the new Soviet
                                leadership could quite plausibly have backed off from <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>'s untenable position
                                when it came to power. He indicated that the French were urging the
                                Soviets to stand firm while the developing countries were giving
                                contradictory advice. Some expressed the view that the Soviets could
                                not give in under pressure while others were concerned that the US
                                and Soviets would get together to curb the role of the Assembly.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_VM1">Vejvoda</persName> implied that the

                                in Prague. He hinted that his delegation had even raised with Prague
                                the possibility that Czechoslovakia pay its arrears, but had been
                                overruled. Prague had replied that “for the time being” it would
                                support the USSR.</item>

                            has ceased. Medals have been awarded U.S. citizens who participated in

                            procedures have been revised. There is also an agreement on patents.

                            cultural exchanges. <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> thought
                            it would also be useful to establish an exchange of economic
                            delegations. He noted that three groups of U.S. Congressmen toured
                            Czechoslovakia recently; he thought they were satisfied with their
                            visits. Tourism has increased since 1963 and the <gloss target="#t_GOC1"
                                >GOC</gloss> is trying to send outstanding people as exchange
                            visitors.</p>
                        <p>Despite these positive phenomena, <persName corresp="#p_DV1"
                                >David</persName> thought it necessary to say that a number of
                            problems remain for which solutions are not being pressed forward. He
                            had in mind in particular the conclusion of an agreement on financial
                            matters. He recalled that at their last meeting the Secretary had said
                            that they should lock their experts in a room until they reached a
                            solution, in the manner of a papal election. The <gloss target="#t_GOC1"
                                >GOC</gloss> presented a draft agreement in March 1964 but has noted
                            no progress since then. <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName>
                            thought the time had come to sit down and sign the agreement, which has
                            an important bearing on the general development of relations.</p>
                        <p>Another problem, <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> said,
                            concerned bilateral trade. Trade has increased a little but significant
                            improvement depends on American policies. The <gloss target="#t_GOC1"
                                >GOC</gloss> is interested in developing trade with many countries
                            and has reached a number of agreements in this field. It is important to
                            restore the <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> relationship that was
                            suspended in 1951.<note n="3" xml:id="d39fn3">On October 2, 1951,

                            significant means of improving general relations between states.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> noted that a Chamber of
                            Commerce Delegation would visit the U.S. in the first quarter of
                            1965.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> said a third problem related
                            to the restricted areas for official travel.<note n="4" xml:id="d39fn4"
                                >On November 12, 1963, the Department of State imposed travel

                            the restrictions are not good for bilateral relations, are
                            discriminatory and do not reflect a realistic evaluation of the
                            situation. They ask that the restrictions be removed. They understand
                            that the problem has been considered within the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> and hope the Secretary will say something about its
                            status. They would not like to take a similar measure in
                            Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary repeated an observation President <persName

                            possibility of reaching further agreements with Eastern European
                            countries. This attitude toward Eastern Europe was one of the issues in
                            our elections. <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0182"/>President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s view of Eastern
                            Europe was that we should keep our guard up but our hand out. The
                            American people decided in effect that we ought to explore possibilities
                            of further agreements. With regard to Czechoslovakia we are prepared to
                            move ahead to see how our relations can be improved. We have noted with
                            satisfaction the modest improvement of the past year or two. The
                            Secretary said he wished to compliment Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName> for his alertness in keeping in
                            touch with ways of improving our relations. The Secretary would not
                            concede that the initiatives all came from one direction, but this was
                            of no great consequence.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary thought the exchange program should be developed further
                            and saw no obstacle to this. He agreed that <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> is the key to significant trade improvement. The
                            executive branch and Congress are taking a new look at this problem and
                            the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is studying it. There are
                            increased indications of interest among our business and economic groups
                            and the State Department has encouraged their interest. But <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> will require legislation and there are
                            certain obstacles in the way of an easy and quick change in the law. For
                            example, it is important for us to reach a settlement of our lend-lease
                            problem with the USSR. Consideration of such legislation will also be
                            influenced somewhat by the general relations and atmosphere between the
                            Warsaw Pact countries and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries. We hope this atmosphere will be favorable so far as it
                            affects this legislation. Some steps can be taken without legislation,
                            however, and we will do what we can.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was interested to note that some Americans showed
                            increased interest in buying in Czechoslovakia. We will work with
                            Congress on this question. The Secretary could not make a firm
                            prediction when Congress would consider the question or what the outcome
                            would be, but he was personally optimistic. Meanwhile there is one area
                            in the economic field where rapid growth is possible, namely tourism.
                            The American tourist has a great interest in visiting countries he has
                            not seen before. In the post-war period relatively few American tourists
                            have gone to Czechoslovakia, so there is a considerable reservoir of
                            tourist interest. The actions of the <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>
                            in this field have been constructive and will encourage further
                            development. We hope the <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> will
                            earmark part of its income from tourism for Czechoslovaks to visit the
                            U.S., since we are in the tourist business too.</p>
                        <p>On the financial agreement, the Secretary said he was frankly embarrassed
                            to find out this morning that he was personally uninformed about its
                            status at the moment. He would phone the Department and get a message to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> on this point. If the
                            Secretary was not personally satisfied with the answer the Department
                            gave him he would ask again.</p>
                        <p>On travel restrictions, the Secretary said he would speak quite frankly.
                            The problem rose in a new form in the last two or three years <pb
                                n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0183"/>because of certain activities
                            of Warsaw Pact missions which we found difficult to accept. These
                            activities had to do with our intercontinental missile sites. In
                            arranging travel certain representatives left normal routes and
                            criss-crossed small country roads in, through, and around sites.
                            Reciprocity was not involved for some of the Warsaw Pact countries
                            because they did not have sites in their territory. We are under no
                            misapprehension where this information was going. Had we not taken steps
                            to insure that such activity was stopped, we would have been in great
                            difficulty and the Warsaw Pact countries would have regarded us as
                            children. However, we would look into the matter again and see whether
                            improvement is possible. This question should not be considered a
                            thermometer of our general relations but as a matter to be thoroughly
                            understood on both sides. We will hope there can be some improvements.
                            If Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName> personally has
                            difficulty the Secretary would be glad to discuss the matter personally
                            and facilitate his travel if he can. The trouble is that Ambassador of
                            Czechoslovakia is not the only one waiting to travel.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> thanked the Secretary for
                            all he had said and looked forward to trade expansion. He would repeat,
                            however, that <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> is an obstacle. The
                            Secretary said he agreed. <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName>
                            said they would now wait with interest for news from us. He believes
                            many Americans are interested in buying Czech goods and he does not know
                            why they should be deprived. Why should Americans not have the best beer
                            in the world, frankfurters, Prague ham, glassware etc.? The Secretary
                            said he agreed there is a market here for such products. At the same
                            time, <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> said, there is
                            interest in American goods; no one has to persuade Czechoslovaks that
                            American production and technology have reached a high level. As for the
                            solution of financial issues, he believed this agreement is ready for
                            signature; the experts are waiting and have nothing more to do. The
                            Secretary said that was his understanding but he would like to find out
                            more about it. <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> said old
                            matters should be liquidated. The <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>
                            has liquidated problems with a number of countries, which has proved to
                            be of mutual benefit.</p>
                        <p>As for the third problem, travel restrictions, <persName corresp="#p_DV1"
                                >David</persName> begged the Secretary to give his attention to this
                            matter so that it also would be liquidated. The restrictions really
                            hamper their people, not only in their work but by making their life
                            more difficult. Americans stationed in Prague have no such troubles. The
                            Czechoslovak Ambassadors to the U.S. and UN and their colleagues have no
                            task except to improve relations. The Secretary said he had tried to be
                            very frank about the essence of this problem. We will see what can be
                            done.</p>

                        <p>The meeting was requested by Messrs. Murin and Vransky who had accepted
                            an invitation to visit the U.S. in connection with the 20th anniversary
                            of ICAO.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Murin</persName> opened the discussion by recalling the
                            recent talks between <gloss target="#t_CSA1">CSA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_PAA1">PAA</gloss> which had led to an interline agreement
                            between them. He said he wished to explore three subjects further, as
                            follows:</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Murin</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_CSA1"
                                >CSA</gloss> was considering operating a few irregular flights to
                            the U.S. next summer in connection with the Czech athletic <pb n="157"
                                xml:id="pg_157" facs="0185"/>games held every five years in Prague
                            (from July 1 to 4, 1965). Approximately ten flights might be involved,
                            and they would all consist of plane-load charters, rather than split
                            charters or individually-ticketed arrangements. Their purpose would be
                            to attract persons of Czech origin living in the U.S. who had an
                            interest in seeing the games.</p>
                        <p>In response to questions, Mr. <persName>Murin</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName>Majsajdr</persName> said that Czechoslovakia had
                            liberalized tourist controls greatly in the past year and they described
                            several of the measures taken. There were not as many Czechs who had an
                            interest in visits to the U.S.; most of these were relatives of persons
                            living in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>There was some discussion of charter concepts. Mr.
                                <persName>Wharton</persName> said that, as a member of IATA, <gloss
                                target="#t_CSA1">CSA</gloss> would be familiar with the rules. Mr.
                                <persName>Murin</persName> indicated he understood these
                            concepts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Ferguson</persName> asked whether Czechoslovakia would
                            allow a U.S. airline to do the same thing proposed by <gloss
                                target="#t_CSA1">CSA</gloss>. Mr. <persName>Murin</persName> replied
                            that Czech civil aviation policy was based on reciprocity. He noted that
                            Czechoslovakia was party to all the international agreements in the
                            aviation field.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Murin</persName> asked whether he could characterize the
                            discussion as indicating there were no major obstacles to the <gloss
                                target="#t_CSA1">CSA</gloss> proposal for charter flights. Mr.

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Murin</persName> said that Czechoslovakia wanted to
                            “prepare conditions” for scheduled <gloss target="#t_CSA1">CSA</gloss>
                            service to the U.S. and he understood that <gloss target="#t_PAA1"
                                >PAA</gloss> was interested in service to Prague. Although nothing
                            had been decided, he wished to raise this matter now to determine what
                            problems there might be. The purpose of such air services would be to
                            foster relations between the two countries and encourage exchange
                            visits. An air transport services agreement already existed. The two
                            airlines had concluded an interline agreement and <gloss
                                target="#t_PAA1">PAA</gloss> had stationed a representative in
                            Prague. This step-by-step approach might create conditions for
                            profitable services.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Ferguson</persName> said he could not answer this question
                            as fully as he could the first subject of non-scheduled service. He said
                            that, although the two countries had an agreement on paper, the U.S.
                            would want to reexamine it to determine whether it was still adequate.
                            After that, the two countries could discuss the subject further.</p>
                        <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0186"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Murin</persName> agreed that the agreement should be
                            re-examined, but he noted that operations had taken place under it for a
                            number of years and that Article 8 provided a ready means for amending
                            the route annex.</p>
                        <p>After saying that the U.S. would wish to study the whole agreement, not
                            merely the route annex, Mr. <persName>Ferguson</persName> said that the
                            U.S. would communicate its views on this question to Mr.
                                <persName>Majsajdr</persName>. Mr. <persName>Murin</persName> said
                            he hoped negotiations could begin within the next year.<note n="3"

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Murin</persName> raised two other questions. He asked
                            whether <gloss target="#t_CSA1">CSA</gloss> could station one of its
                            representatives in New York. After some discussion, it was concluded
                            this was not an aviation matter as such, and that <gloss
                                target="#t_CSA1">CSA</gloss> could use the establishment of the
                            CEDOK office in New York both as a precedent and as an example of how to
                            establish a <gloss target="#t_CSA1">CSA</gloss> office.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Murin</persName> also asked if the U.S. would approve the
                            lease of jet aircraft to <gloss target="#t_CSA1">CSA</gloss>. Mr.
                                <persName>Wharton</persName> said that there are no general
                            obstacles to the leasing of aircraft if certain conditions are filled,
                            and that the U.S. lessor would be aware of these conditions. Mr.
                                <persName>Ferguson</persName> noted that it was the responsibility
                            of the U.S. lessor, not the foreign lessee, to obtain <gloss
                                target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> approval. Therefore, <gloss
                                target="#t_CSA1">CSA</gloss> should look to the U.S. lessor to
                            determine whether U.S. approval could be obtained.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Ferguson</persName> said that Czechoslovakia should be
                            aware that the <gloss target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> has statutory
                            responsibility for the regulation of the economic aspects of aviation,
                            both domestic and foreign, but that the State Department take a
                            prominent role with respect to foreign airlines because of the
                            international relations aspects. The U.S. Government thus speaks with
                            one voice on such matters.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Murin</persName> felt that this informal exchange was a
                            good start toward “normalizing” aviation relations between the two
                            countries.</p>

                            restrictions on Czechoslovak diplomats. The Secretary had promised
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> to look into these
                            two bilateral problems,<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">

                                corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName> said, and he wished to learn the
                            results of the review. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DK1"
                                >Duda</persName> said that he did not think he needed to restate the
                            Czechoslovak position on these two questions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he was familiar with the Czechoslovak views on
                            these subjects. With regard to the travel restrictions, the Secretary
                            said that it is a complicated matter, requiring a review with other
                            Departments of the Government, and that at this time he could say
                            nothing new on the subject.</p>
                        <p>Insofar as the claims settlement is concerned, the Secretary said that we
                            have had a sharp critical reaction to the proposed draft agreement from
                            claimants and some Congressmen. He said that the reaction was based in
                            part on the very large discrepancy between the settlements we have
                            concluded with other East European countries and the proposed settlement
                            with Czechoslovakia. The Secretary then cited the following percentages
                            we have obtained in the claims settlements with other countries:
                            Yugoslavia (1948)—91%, Yugoslavia (1964)—60% (estimated), Romania
                            (1960)—40%, Bulgaria (1963)—75%, Poland (1960)—50%, (estimated),
                            Czechoslovakia (1964) proposed—16% (approx.). The Secretary went on to
                            say that major resistance to the settlement with Czechoslovakia resulted
                            from its being way out of line with other agreements and that we could
                            not move ahead on the present basis. To force the issue on the basis of
                            the present draft agreement in the face of strong opposition would
                            create an impediment to our broader policy objectives and to our <pb
                                n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0189"/>intentions in the area of
                            East-West trade. The Secretary suggested that “my colleagues in the
                            Department could review the subject” with the Ambassador to see what
                            were the possibilities in this matter. The Secretary added, after we
                            have had access to the appropriate Congressional Committees and
                            ascertained their thinking, we would be in a better position to act.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName> said that he would
                            report the Secretary's remarks to Minister <persName corresp="#p_DV1"
                                >David</persName>, but that at this time he wished to make two
                            points: <list>

                                    <p>Negotiations for the agreement had extended over a period of
                                        about ten years and there were few people around who were
                                        directly involved. He was one of those few. In the course of
                                        the long negotiations, when the lump sum claims settlement
                                        for nationalized property was under discussion, the amount
                                        was never presented as a problem by the American side and
                                        there was no indication of dissatisfaction with the
                                        settlement, the basic provisions of which were agreed upon
                                        in 1958. We acted in good faith, Dr. <persName
                                            corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName> said, that we were in
                                        agreement with the American Government on the terms of the
                                        settlement and that the American Ambassador in Prague had
                                        full powers to negotiate.</p>
                                    <p>The Secretary interjected that the agreement was a tentative
                                        draft, which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName>
                                        acknowledged.</p>

                                <item>The second point Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DK1"
                                        >Duda</persName> wished to make was related to the gold
                                    question as a part of the agreement. Under the prevailing
                                    circumstances, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DK1"
                                        >Duda</persName> said, we agreed to make the gold question
                                    part of the package, although it was not strictly a bilateral
                                    matter. He added that the Nazi-looted gold was to be returned to
                                    Czechoslovakia under the Paris agreement. Although
                                    Czechoslovakia has been able to live without the gold for twenty
                                    years and could do so for another twenty years, they regard the
                                    blocking of the recovery of the gold by the United States as a
                                    very sensitive political question, transcending its economic
                                    importance, because of the close connection of the gold problem
                                    with the Munich agreement and the German question.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he was familiar with the Czechoslovak position
                            in this regard, that he did not wish to enter into a legal discussion of
                            the matter, but that there were obligations of varying kinds on both
                            sides which have a bearing on each other. The Secretary added that the
                            stakes in our relations are greater in the field of bilateral trade,
                            which should be developed on a positive basis and in the broader context
                            of East-West trade relations. The Secretary said that we would like to
                            see the question of the financial and claims settlement out of the way
                            and suggested that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName>
                            may wish to discuss the matter further with Mr. <persName

                            agreed.</p>

                            demonstrating that advocates of such Western orientation will meet with

                            to Czech need for Western wheat. In any case I think it is in interest
                            of long-term US policy towards Eastern Europe to take them at face value
                            and as referring to overall policy. We shall not for long time see here
                            dramatic shift from pro-Soviet alignment, such as occurred in Rumania,
                            but there have been small signs and subtle changes of attitudes which
                            suggest that Czechs, too, are asserting their national interest more
                            than in past. There has been, moreover, striking degree of internal
                            liberalization in past two or three years, and far-reaching reforms in
                            economy are going forward, if somewhat haltingly. We have so far given
                            very little sign that we recognize that there has been any change at all
                            since Stalinist days.</p>
                        <p>I therefore renew recommendation which I have made through informal
                            channel that we take significant positive step forward such as signature

                            also have certain incidental advantages to specific American

                                had been a moderate increase in Czech-American trade. This had been
                                helped by visits on both sides; <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164"
                                    facs="0192"/>another American business group was expected in
                                Prague soon. But Czechoslovakia was limited in its capacity to work
                                toward further increase of trade since it had no representation in
                                New York, the center of most commercial dealings. The Embassy's
                                commercial section was located in Washington, out of the commercial
                                mainstream of the country. Minister <persName corresp="#p_DV1"
                                    >David</persName> asked whether it would not be possible to
                                station in New York a few of the personnel of the commercial section
                                of the Czechoslovakian Embassy in Washington as a subsection of the
                                Embassy, not a separate, independent commercial representatives
                                office. The Secretary took note of the fact that the establishment
                                of a commercial representatives office had been included in the
                                draft of the financial agreement between the two countries. He said
                                in the given context he did not find the Czechoslovak request
                                extraordinary, but that he would look into the matter further after
                                his return to Washington.</item>

                            <item>Minister <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> said there
                                had been a marked increase in scientific and cultural exchange
                                between the two countries, which was definitely a positive trend in
                                their relations. Czechoslovak films had received high critical
                                recognition and a number of awards. The Czechoslovak government was
                                considering a number of exhibits in the U.S.; among these were an
                                exhibit of medieval Jewish religious art, drawings of children who
                                had been in the Theresienstadt concentration camp and works of
                                Czechoslovak modern artists. The Minister said this favorable
                                development could be much greater if some old outstanding issues
                                were resolved. One was the financial and property claims agreement,
                                which had been initialed by the U.S. side but not concluded. The
                                second was granting of Most Favored Nation treatment to
                                Czechoslovakia. Solution of these problems would result in a great
                                increase in trade and contacts. Without solution, there would be
                                limits to progress in these fields.</item>

                            <item>The Secretary replied that since he and the Minister had last seen
                                each other, the President had proposed to the Congress East-West
                                trade legislation which would permit granting <gloss
                                    target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment to individual countries.
                                According to our constitution, this legislation must originate in
                                our House of Representatives. The Secretary said, for the Minister's
                                private use only and not for public circulation, he had been told by
                                Congressional leaders that they were not prepared to take up the
                                trade legislation before the pending Congressional elections but
                                would be prepared to do so after the elections. This was a political
                                factor beyond the control of the executive branch in the American
                                system. We expected Congressional hearings on the bill to begin in
                                January or February. Meanwhile, we were trying quietly to build up
                                support for the legislation among various public groups including
                                business and trade union circles; visits of American businessmen to
                                Czechoslovakia like that mentioned by the Minister could be helpful
                                in this sense.</item>

                            <item>The Secretary said the financial and property claims agreement was
                                to some extent linked with the <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                                legislation. The previous draft agreement, which had been a
                                working-level paper subject to Departmental approval, had, in
                                addition to earlier payments from Czech properties here, provided
                                for settlement through payment by Czechoslovakia of $2 million
                                against total property claims; $20 million in gold would also be
                                returned to Czechoslovakia. The amount to be paid by Czechoslovakia
                                in this settlement was out of line with the American property
                                claims, and the settlement as such was out of line with other
                                similar settlements in Eastern Europe. The draft had encountered
                                very severe opposition in Congress. If signed, it would have become
                                an obstacle to conclusion of East-West trade legislation because the
                                American claimants would have made their objections effectively felt
                                in Congress. Consequently, as a minimum step, we must delay action
                                on the agreement with Czechoslovakia. As a new chapter in
                                Czechoslovakia-American relations developed, we would hope to find
                                some way to proceed with the question without causing a political
                                incident, which would be a set-back to our relations.</item>

                            <item>Minister <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> said that the
                                negotiations had been a long time in the process. Each step by both
                                sides had been carefully considered, the negotiators on both sides
                                had been sincere. He said that the Czechoslovak side had all along
                                had its own critics, who kept claiming that the Czech Foreign
                                Ministry was not pushing hard enough and its claims were too low. As
                                regarded the gold, it belonged to Czechoslovakia and had been stolen
                                by Hitler. This fact was undisputed and the other members of the
                                Tripartite Commission controlling disposal of the gold had expressed
                                their agreement to its return to Czechoslovakia. The moral issue
                                here was clear: the gold belonged to the Czechs, had been stolen by
                                the Nazis, and should be returned to Czechoslovakia. Minister
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> said he was hesitant
                                to make observations on the domestic political proc-ess of the U.S.,
                                but wasn't it possible that progress toward these agreements with
                                Czechoslovakia before the elections might not actually have a
                                favorable effect on the American electorate.</item>

                            <item>The Secretary said he would not debate the gold question. Our
                                problems were procedural and political in character; we hoped in
                                time to find a better solution. He said that American political
                                leaders, who had to be the best judges of such matters, told him
                                that sympathy or a favorable attitude does not have the same impact
                                on the electorate and on election results as does opposition. More
                                generally, it was true that the overall atmosphere in the United
                                States had improved with regard to East-West relations. President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had taken the
                                initiative on this question on a number of occasions. The
                                formulation of some of his statements may not have pleased the
                                governments of Eastern Europe, but they had definitely helped to
                                move public opinion.</item>

                                V. J. Kazan, a U.S. citizen of Czech origin, was forcibly removed
                                from the aircraft and arrested on charges of espionage. In February

                                >MFA</gloss>, received a reply and wished to read it to the

                        <p>In response to the Secretary's question whether he could leave a copy,
                            the Ambassador said that it was “incomplete and in rough form”. He would
                            read it slowly.</p>
                        <p>As you know, <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName> said, Kazan is
                            being charged with crimes which are punishable in all countries and on
                            the basis of a court order issued in 1963. We are not going to suspend
                            the application of Czech laws simply because Kazan is a US citizen. He
                            will be brought to trial. To the Secretary's question whether the
                            Ambassador knew when the trial will be held <persName corresp="#p_DK1"
                                >Duda</persName> replied: “No”. <persName corresp="#p_DK1"
                                >Duda</persName> then said, we have proceeded in full conformity
                            with international procedures and we have granted consular access. We
                            are prepared to issue visas to Mrs. <persName>Kazan</persName> and to
                            the father-in-law, <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName> continued,
                            and I presume that a request to see Kazan will receive favorable
                            consideration. We have protested the exaggerated handling of the matter
                            by the State Department and the US public, which is out of proportion to
                            the importance of the issue. We cannot agree with the anti-Czechoslovak
                            measures which have been taken, such as the withholding of visas and the
                            unofficial but practical discouragement of travel.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d46fn3">The United States had declined to issue visas to a
                                Czech cultural exhibit group and indicated that a tightening of visa
                                requirements for Czech citizens was a likely response to Kazan's
                                seizure.</note> The Kazan case is of a consular nature and will be
                            handled as such and on its merits. Publicity, pressures, and retaliatory
                            measures will only complicate a solution to the problem. We have no
                            intention to permit this case to undermine our relations, but it is
                            necessary that the court proceedings be permitted to take their
                            course.</p>
                        <p>In the past, <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName> continued, we
                            have received no cooperation from the US to our just requests involving
                            questions affecting our bilateral relations. These have been seriously
                            affected by the discrepancy between words and deeds. US statements that
                            we are interested in normalizing relations are contradicted by the
                            precipitous actions such as have been taken in this case. These are
                            bound to affect relations adversely. US pronouncements are impaired by
                            our unwillingness to sign the concluded financial/claims agreement and
                            the yardstick of our sincerity is our unwillingness to return the
                            Nazi-looted gold. In this context, the US image is not a good one and we
                            are not going to prevent the public from learning the full facts of this
                            matter. The Ambassador hoped that his statement clarified the Czech
                            position in this matter.</p>
                        <p>Referring to <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName>'s remark
                            regarding a solution of the case, the Secretary asked what he meant by
                            this. <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName> replied that he had no
                            authority <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0197"/>to elaborate and
                            added that he preferred to let the statement stand. He then said that
                            the atmosphere engendered by a campaign in the press and by measures
                            intended to exert pressure cannot but complicate the general
                            atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that there is a distinction between the general
                            atmosphere and the fate of an individual. We know well the circumstances
                            under which Kazan's detention took place, the Secretary said, and he
                            proceeded to recount the details of the flight which was diverted from
                            its normal northern route to make the unscheduled landing at Prague. The
                            Secretary said this was a clear case of kidnapping by security agents.
                            If Kazan had gone to Czechoslovakia voluntarily, the case would have
                            been difficult enough, but under the circumstances this is a very
                            special case. We cannot overlook this in terms of our general relations.
                            Under our constitutional system the fate of an individual is of greatest
                            concern. The Secretary then asked what would happen to the members of
                            the family if we issued them passports to go to Czechoslovakia?
                                <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName> replied that he had no
                            doubt they would be safe. The Secretary responded there was a major
                            doubt about Kazan's safety, although he had had no intention of visiting
                            Czechoslovakia. <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName> replied that
                            he had nothing to add to the Soviet statements on the landing of the
                            plane “which are known to you”. As to the safety of Americans and of the
                            Kazan family there is no doubt, especially on the background of 30,000
                            to 40,000 American tourists a year who have visited Czechoslovakia
                            without any major incidents. <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName>
                            repeated that the Kazan case has been magnified out of all proportion
                            and to the point where it has overshadowed relations, whose improvement
                            both sides strived to achieve. <persName corresp="#p_DK1"
                                >Duda</persName> then asked whether the Kazan incident is being used
                            by some people here as a pretext to obstruct progress in US-Czech
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that this surely is not true of the President,
                            himself, and the Executive in general. He said that we relied and will
                            rely again on the assurances the Czechs have given us regarding the
                            safety of American travelers, but this case presents us with a very
                            special situation. The Secretary added that on his recent trip he had
                            encountered many Senators and Congressmen, all of whom had questioned
                            him and commented on the Kazan case. The Secretary also mentioned his
                            lunch-eon with seven Congressmen earlier in the day who brought up the
                            case.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said to <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName>: “I
                            wish you would ask Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_DV1"
                                >David</persName> how he envisages a solution in the interest of
                            better relations on both sides.” The Secretary expressed the hope that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName> could reply to his
                            question personally. He said he would withhold further comment until he
                            received an answer from <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName>,
                            adding that he deliberately refrained from talking about the case at his
                            press conference that afternoon. <persName corresp="#p_DK1"
                                >Duda</persName> promised to convey the Secretary's request to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName>, <pb n="170"
                                xml:id="pg_170" facs="0198"/>but added that he wished to stress
                            again that any publicity and pressure will only tend to complicate
                            developments.</p>
                        <p>The meeting was concluded with the Secretary saying that he hoped to see
                                <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName> again when he had a reply
                            from Minister <persName corresp="#p_DV1">David</persName>.<note n="4"

                            <item>In circumstances of post-1948 US-Czech relations, unilateral
                                restitution of gold, despite legitimate Czech claim to it, and
                                however heavy Czech pressure becomes, is clearly out of the
                                question. Since we are forced to maintain logical and essential
                                connection between claims and restitution, the trick is somehow to
                                induce Czechs that a higher figure is in mutual interest and that
                                they should join in working toward it. This unlikely to be achieved,
                                however, by simply setting higher sum and negotiating downward to

                                given different, more attractive face, something Czechs can digest

                                1961 accord. If Dept interested, would be happy to suggest in Limdis
                                telegram increase I think we could obtain in claims figure. In any
                                event believe we should not give detailed written reply to Czech
                                note but should propose initiation of discussion based on plan of
                                our own. Even if Czechs rejected it I firmly believe our tactical

                                must understand our domestic political problem and we are prepared
                                to take theirs into account by proposing modalities which would make
                                an upward claims settlement easier for them. These would include

                                argue that payment of a higher figure will be facilitated by a

                            <item>FYI. You should be aware that House Banking and Currency Committee
                                presently holding hearings on further 5-year extension of Exim
                                charter beyond June 30, 1968. Hearings have revealed vocal minority
                                sentiment in favor of restricting authority of Exim to help finance
                                exports to Communist countries. Despite such sentiment, outlook
                                appears favorable for Exim re-chartering without restrictions. While
                                publicity about Czech visit could complicate re-chartering approval
                                and some publicity may be unavoidable if Czechs visit
                                    <persName>Douglas</persName> and Boeing plants, we believe
                                invitations should be supported. Exim willing to receive Czech
                                delegation if it comes to Washington, but you should not make
                                specific reference to Exim in your conversations with Czechs. End

                                within 30 days. Delegation should expect to spend 10–12 days in US.

                        <p>55. 1. As Department will have noticed, current international situation
                            seems to have furnished Czechs with new pretext for hardening official
                            attitudes toward US in recent weeks.</p>
                        <p>2. We have the impression that the regime in its immediate outlook is
                            motivated by purpose of isolating and ostracizing the US, and even
                            insulting and humiliating us. Another fact is perhaps regime's
                            frustration stemming from US failure to liberalize trade (<gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>) and to take other steps in the
                            economic/financial area. FonMin hard-liners have gone so far as to
                            represent return of looted Czech gold as a make-or-break issue.</p>
                        <p>3. Czechs apparently feel they can pursue their present course with
                            impunity because of recent successful effort to acquire international
                            respectability. For them this is what Montreal is all about<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d51fn2">Reference is to the Montreal “Expo '67” world
                                fair.</note> and they actively push same goal in exchanges of state
                            visits with our Western allies. Against this background what they appear
                            to seek especially from the US as still readily attainable is a
                            continuation of scientific and academic grants for selected Czech
                            nationals in pursuit of technological know-how. We know Czech
                            authorities attach considerable importance to such programs. They have
                            taxed British with not coming anywhere near the some 200 grants
                            (official and private) extended to Czechs in US.</p>
                        <p>4. I believe that without entering on any irreversible steps and
                            certainly without altering our present visa and tourist policies, we
                            should be thinking about how we might scale down the advantages Czechs
                            derive to a level more consistent with state of bilateral relations they
                            have imposed.</p>
                        <p>5. Starting with US Government grants, we should review those of
                            predominantly Czech benefit mostly in physical and engineering science
                            with a view to a selective non-renewal for successor candidates. Word
                            that time and atmosphere are not opportune could also be discreetly
                            passed to some of US academic groups sponsoring ambitious programs for
                            Czechoslovakia. Even though some exchanges of special interest to us
                            might suffer, the message would soon get across to authorities here that
                            they cannot continue with their present policies without paying a
                            price.</p>
                        <p>6. It might also be wise to discourage prominent American visitors from
                            coming to Czechoslovakia for prestige purposes until such time as <pb
                                n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0205"/>there are signs they will be
                            properly received. Our government spokesmen, and especially those on
                            speaking trips throughout US, could perhaps counter Czechoslovakia's
                            more blatant distortions of fact on international and bilateral issues
                            in a manner which would get back to policymakers here. External media,
                            including <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>, could also play a
                            part.</p>
                        <p>7. On other side of the coin and specifically with reference to economic
                            relations where we may shortly confront Czechs again, I recommend we
                            proceed in a straightforward manner, not only as a matter of equity but
                            also wise expediency. Our suggested approach has been set forth in a
                            series of messages, in particular Prague's 1642, April 5,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d51fn3">
                                <ref target="#d48">Document 48</ref>.</note> and we feel strongly
                            that demands for a substantially higher figure on claims would be
                            unattainable and counterproductive. We would not expect Czechs to accept
                            every offer the Embassy has proposed (thus placing US domestic
                            embarrassment of an immediate return of gold under present international
                            conditions), but effort would at least help deflect a head-on clash
                            while affording an opportunity of engaging Czechs in faith so discussion
                            of a settlement that would be feasible and fair. [sic] We have promised
                            to follow up on their March request for return of gold and I hope that
                            our response will not be much longer delayed.</p>
                        <p>8. In short, while believing we should match Czech actions by bearing
                            down in some of political and prestige areas first mentioned, we think
                            our long-term interests would be safeguarded by showing for our part we
                            are amenable to this type of businesslike approach, including such
                            pragmatic initiatives as bilateral air agreement and continuing
                            alleviations in trade.</p>

                            <item>The current year has not been a good one for the regime. While the
                                classic Communist production indices have been favorable, the new
                                economic reform is simply not yielding intended results and is
                                likely to run into further political and technical difficulties
                                which may come to a head in the party plenum scheduled for the first
                                half of the month. The writers remain quiescent for the time being
                                but unsatisfied, while a new source of trouble has loomed from local
                                student quarters and their reaction to police brutality in putting
                                down the October 31 demonstration where extremely serious
                                consequences could have resulted from a loss of life.<note n="3"

                            <item>Over and above all of this is the general recognition that the
                                government and the party suffer from internal confusion and are not
                                operating efficiently. It has been reported publicly that the
                                party's role is being re-examined and it is likely that more is
                                taking place behind the scenes. The opportunities to speculate on
                                possible combinations are infinite. As explained to me by a
                                knowledgeable source, an obstacle to reform is that changes would be
                                regarded as imputing blame and humiliation, especially for Novotny,
                                which it is considered desirable to avoid. Even divesting
                                    <persName>Novotny</persName> of some of his functions and
                                burdens could have that effect.</item>

                            <item>According to one of my Eastern European colleagues, questions of

                                on the grounds that it would deviate from and go beyond the
                                compromises and accommodations worked out at the May 1966 Party
                                Congress. My informant thought that a larger consensus and more
                                discussion would <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0210"/>be
                                required and that it was even questionable whether decisions would

                            <item>On balance, it looks as though leadership changes are in fact
                                under consideration. Given the party's history of stability,
                                however, and the difficulties of selecting a new team acceptable to
                                contending factions, the present leadership may still have time to
                                work out tolerable solutions to its admittedly grave

                            Prague on unexpected “short friendly visit,” on eve of Czechoslovak
                            Central Committee Plenum reportedly to deal with leadership changes,

                            of impending top leadership changes, most of them involving Party First
                            Secretary and President Novotny. Whatever merit of rumors, it is
                            incontestable that recent failures in Czechoslovak foreign and domestic
                            policies have increased disaffection and dissension within Party to such
                            extent they pose most serious challenge to stability of

                            no single Party leader or faction has emerged to threaten directly
                            Novotny's position, his authority and prestige appear to have been
                            eroded considerably over past months.</p>

                            intervention in Czechoslovak leadership developments. Although Kremlin

                            interfere in Czechoslovak affairs, it may feel it has no alternative to
                            action intended to insure stable regime in Prague. Soviets undoubtedly
                            realize any interference would render them liable to charges from
                            Chinese and others of crass interference in affairs another party and
                            possibly unite Czechoslovak party against Soviets, as nothing else
                            could. Should <persName>Novotny</persName> be deposed in wake of
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> visit, Soviets could
                            escape these charges.</p>
                        <p>Probable that <persName>Novotny</persName> instrumental in having
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> visit Prague, in

                            difficulties. Soviets probably prefer to have
                                <persName>Novotny</persName> remain in power, since he known

                                    would bow to public pressures and would resign his post as

                                <p>The Ambassador felt that the Central Committee Plenum on March 28
                                    would be very important. He anticipated that, at this meeting,
                                    an action program would be elaborated and that a number of
                                    personnel changes in the government would be decided. He thought
                                    that the action program would include various measures designed
                                    to further the process of democratization in his country. Among
                                    these, he anticipated that an increased role for the Central
                                    Committee would be provided for and that the police would be
                                    “brought under control”. Various proposals are being considered
                                    with regard to this question, but the Ambassador thought that
                                    the most likely solution would be for the police to be removed
                                    from the Ministry of Interior and to be put under the authority
                                    of the Minister of Justice. The Ambassador also felt that the
                                    action program would direct Czech foreign relations in general
                                    terms, indicating a desire for good relations with all countries
                                    regardless of ideological considerations. He said that,
                                    realistically speaking, it must be recognized that the Viet-Nam
                                    conflict posed a problem in US-Czech relations; nevertheless, he
                                    felt that, within the limits imposed by this situation, the new
                                    leaders in Prague would wish to improve relations with the
                                    United States.</p>
                                <p>The Ambassador repeatedly expressed his pleasure at changes
                                    taking place in Prague and said he was confident that things
                                    were moving in a desirable direction and would continue to do
                                    so. He ruled out any “foreign intervention” (obviously meaning
                                    from the Soviet side), although he acknowledged that, if civil
                                    strife developed and there were <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186"

                                    radically. However, he did not anticipate that matters would go
                                    this far.</p>

                                        and close collaborator of Novotny, defected on February 25,
                                        following revelation of a plan to use military units in
                                        support of Novotny.</note> The Ambassador spoke with great
                                    seriousness about this case. He observed that it was ironic, to
                                    say the least, that Sejna, who represented the worst element of
                                    the “conservative” clique in Czechoslovakia, should find a haven
                                    in the United States. He stressed that the Sejna case was of
                                    political importance and said that it would be most unfortunate
                                    if the main problem with which the new leadership had to deal in
                                    its relations with the United States was a refusal to extradite
                                    Senja. The Ambassador said he was particularly concerned about
                                    the possibility that Sejna might be exploited in this country on
                                    TV and in the press. He mentioned that he had seen several days
                                    ago in <hi rend="italic">The Washington Post</hi> an indication
                                    that Sejna might appear on “Meet the Press”. He felt that this
                                    would be greatly resented in his country.</p>
                                <p>The Ambassador added that he expected to be seeing me within the
                                    next few days to present additional evidence from Prague
                                    concerning Sejna's criminal activities.</p>
                                <p>In responding to the Ambassador, I agreed that the Sejna case had

                                    sought Sejna out—he had come to us. I remarked that, as the
                                    Ambassador was well aware, we were handling the request for his
                                    extradition in strict accord with the provisions of our
                                    Extradition Treaty with Czechoslovakia. Consideration of such a
                                    request was time-consuming. In the meantime, there was no
                                    intention on our part to exploit the case through publicity, and
                                    I certainly did not anticipate that the General would be
                                    appearing on any TV program.</p>
                                <p>The Ambassador appeared to take special note of my last

                                    than the immediate question presented by the Sejna case, the
                                    Ambassador observed that the two outstanding problems between
                                    our countries were in the field of trade and gold/claims matter.
                                    On trade, the main question is obviously that of
                                    most-favored-nation treatment for Czechoslovakia. Ambassador

                                    representatives in considering most-favored-nation treatment for
                                    Czechoslovakia; the Ambassador felt this might well be true,
                                    although he was not optimistic that any favorable action on
                                        <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> would be taken during

                                <p>I said that I would not dispute the Ambassador's conclusion,
                                    although I certainly agreed with Ambassador <persName
                                        corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>'s remarks to him, and
                                    thought that sooner or later the trend of events in
                                    Czechoslovakia, if continued, would produce favorable
                                    results.</p>
                                <p>On the matter of gold/claims, the Ambassador said that, as we
                                    knew, the authorities in Prague took a very negative view of our
                                    proposals. However, on his advice, the Czech side had held off
                                    giving us a formal, negative response to our note. The
                                    Ambassador hinted that, given the political uncertainties in the
                                    United States at this time, it might be considered advisable to
                                    leave the whole question open pending our elections in November;
                                    thereafter it might appear that the United States would be
                                    willing to take a more forthcoming stand on the problem.</p>
                                <p>I emphasized to the Ambassador that the gold/claims problem was
                                    not really political in nature, and I strongly discouraged him
                                    from thinking that our election could affect our position on the
                                    problem one way or the other. Regardless of the Administration
                                    in power, or of its views concerning improving relations with
                                    Czechoslovakia, the fact would remain that we had a very large
                                    outstanding claims settlement still pending with Czechoslovakia
                                    and the interests of the U.S. claimants had to be taken into
                                    account.</p>
                                <p>I reminded the Ambassador that our proposal had not been made on
                                    a take-it-or-leave-it basis.<note n="5" xml:id="d56fn5">See <ref
                                            target="#d52">Document 52</ref>.</note> While we felt
                                    that our proposal had been a reasonable one, and certainly any
                                    counter-proposal would have to be “in the ball park” of the
                                    general framework sketched out in our proposal, we would welcome
                                    suggestions from the Czech side as to how they would envisage a
                                    settlement. I felt that a completely negative Czech response
                                    would be regrettable and I urged the Ambassador to consider the
                                    possibility of further discussions with us of the problem.</p>

                            <item>To take latter difficulty first, one obvious factor is that Czechs
                                are not Poles or Hungarians. Neither history nor popular attitudes
                                thus far in crisis suggest that Czechs as a nation will lose their
                                heads. Small minority may stridently urge extreme ideas, but
                                majority would probably remain passive, and if coalition (it may
                                still be too early to call it a regime) is able to continue to give
                                vocal minority chance to blow off steam seems unlikely that trouble
                                would arise on that score. Students have been significant plus on
                                progressive side and may become even more politically active, but
                                their restraint thus far (especially in Prague) has been noteworthy
                                and it seems unlikely they would deliberately endanger regime they
                                felt was working in right direction. Slovaks are historically less
                                averse to taking risks but will probably be occupied with
                                discussions of federalism at least in immediate future.</item>

                            <item>More immediate prospect of resistance is from proponents of
                                caution and conservatism working within framework of victorious
                                coalition. Cernik has suggested that adoption of action program
                                should bring discussion to an end; if new [garble] tries to do so it

                                crisis. In any case coalition will be highly vulnerable to
                                dissension in its ranks when it begins dealing with specific issues.
                                For example there are signs that trade unions may come to life and
                                if so they will certainly cast critical eye on some aspects of
                                economic reform; probable desire of economic reformers to sit firmly
                                on trade unions in such case could put them at odds with political
                                reformers who may welcome trade unions as independent force.
                                Czech-Slovak problems are obviously another fertile field for
                                manipulations to break up the coalition.</item>

                                probably plied by hysterical East Germans. The Soviets of course
                                have powerful economic (to say nothing of military) levers at their
                                fingertips, but will they attempt to use them in a drastic way? Or,
                                more to the point, will Czechoslovakia give cause to use them? It
                                can be hoped that lessons were learned on all sides from 1956, and
                                it can be expected that Prague will do its utmost to avoid any high

                                Communist facade. But without yielding to apocalyptic prophecy, it
                                is obvious that consequences of even partial success would reach far

                        </p>
                        <p>When I saw the Under Secretary last week he asked me to follow up with
                            you a suggestion to have a new look at the above question. He thought
                            that alternate possibilities should be explored in the light of recent
                            events in Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> suggested Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> be informed and
                            consulted in view of his concern with our nationalization claims against
                            Czechoslovakia in 1964. Accordingly, a copy of this paper is being sent
                            to him, as well as to other interested parties in the Department.</p>
                        <p>The crux of the matter is that against the background of earlier
                            negotiations with us, the Czech Government is mounting a major campaign
                            for the return of some $22 million of monetary gold looted by the Nazis.
                            This gold is now held in US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                            French custody, but we have refused to agree to its release pending a
                            settlement of our nationalization claims and other outstanding financial
                            matters. The Czechs insist that we concluded an agreement in December
                                1961<note n="2" xml:id="d58fn2">See <ref target="#d37fn3">footnote
                                    3, Document 37</ref>.</note> (which, in principle, we did)
                            whereby we would have accepted some $11–12 million in payment of our
                            claims (this sum representing $9 million from our sale of the American
                            steel mill purchased by but denied to the Czechs, plus $2 million in an
                            additional Czech contribution, but at the cost of $8 million to the
                            Czechs because of the loss suffered by them in our sale of the steel
                            mill); that we have repudiated this agreement as well as the work
                            accomplished in the earlier negotiations started in 1955; and that we
                            have created a new and unacceptable situation in our latest proposal of
                            November 7, 1967<note n="3" xml:id="d58fn3">See <ref target="#d52"
                                    >Document 52</ref>.</note> which increased our claims fourfold
                            to a total of $44 million.</p>
                        <p>The above proposal does, however, offer the Czechs certain benefits in a
                            seven-year stretch-out repayment period and in a possible windfall of
                            some $5 million and a continuing half-million dollars annually due in
                            dollar payments to US social security annuitants in Czechoslovakia. Our
                                <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0219"/>proposal nevertheless lacks
                            an essential adjunct to make it negotiable, namely, our restoration of
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> which we are unable to provide
                            because of the non-enactment of the East-West trade legislation.</p>
                        <p>In my view, we possess two guarantees, or bargaining levers, to secure
                            satisfaction of our citizens' legitimate claims, namely, non-release of
                            the gold and the negotiating value of an eventual restoration of <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>. I seriously question whether it is
                            necessary to hold both of these in our hands at the present time. I am
                            firmly convinced that the second factor will be decisive and that we
                            will not get a claims settlement of anywhere near the amount we are
                            asking until we can exploit the prospect of restoring <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>By continuing our present course we put ourselves in the position of
                            receiving nothing more for our claimants for the foreseeable future,
                            while we bring down on ourselves the odium of blocking the return of
                            gold looted from the Czechs by their Nazi invaders. Palliatives, such as
                            trying to reach partial settlements through offsets on blocked accounts,
                            may help a little but not very much, as long as the main issues remain
                            at an impasse. Real heat is likely to build up against us later this
                            year when Czechoslovakia observes the 50th anniversary of its founding
                            (in Pittsburgh) as a nation. There are cogent political reasons for
                            trying to do better, especially when our aim should be to differentiate
                            in the new regime's favor and to develop relations which could promote
                            our influence and interests in the Communist world.</p>

                            <item>In retrospect, our failure to deter the Communist takeover in
                                Czechoslovakia in 1948 was one of the most serious mistakes of our
                                foreign policy since the war. Firm diplomatic action then—a period
                                of our nuclear monopoly—could well have prevented the Cold War.
                                Similarly, our public statement in 1956 that we would not intervene
                                gave the Soviets a full license.<note n="4" xml:id="d60fn4"

                                the question of what the reaction should be in the event of Soviet
                                military intervention in Czechoslovakia. This is also the case in

                                Under the circumstances, I wish to set down relevant considerations
                                as seen from here.</item>

                            <item>It is inevitable, of course, to recall the Hungarian experience. A
                                major difference in the case of Czechoslovakia, however, is the
                                presence of substantial US forces in Germany. This means that,
                                contrary to the Hungarian case, we could in theory signal our
                                support for the Czech Government by moving our troops closer to the
                                Czech border or, indeed, cross the border to assist the Czechs in
                                warding off a Soviet attack. I cannot, of course, on the basis of my
                                responsibilities in Germany, make any significant contribution to
                                whether this is desirable per se. Not only Germany but <gloss

                                Acting Assistant Secretary Sahm raised the matter with us in a very
                                preliminary way, and the view he conveyed can be summarized as
                                follows: (a) the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> must avoid any
                                involvement internally in Czechoslovakia and (b) the United States

                                i.e., the utilization of any US forces stationed here. During the

                                    DEF 1–1 GER–W)</note> Sahm, after a direct telephone call from
                                State Secretary Duckwitz, emphasized the German wish that the United
                                States fully respect German sovereignty in planning for a Czech
                                emergency. Sahm also suggested that we review very carefully the
                                output of Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, and RIAS during the
                                current period. He clearly meant that any statements emanating from
                                German soil which might seem to constitute intervention in the Czech
                                situation should be avoided.</item>

                                high German level—is that it would be unrealistic for us to think in

                                1946 agreement with something else is perhaps without precedent, in
                                any case not fair way to treat issue. Gold was taken from
                                Czechoslovakia in difficult circumstances brought about by Western
                                Powers (reverting to subject later he alleged US official documents

                                in Munich Agreement), and US has responsibility to liquidate effects
                                of World War II. Instead it is trying through gold to exert pressure
                                on small country. (He alleged US behavior in this instance suggested

                                since we had told Czech Embassy two years before we could not go
                                through with principles. Czech right to gold never in question, but
                                US claimants have substantial equal right to satisfactory settlement

                                “as you repudiated 1961 agreement.” Thus, he said, he would be
                                grateful if my optimism were fulfilled but he personally could not
                                share it. In general, he said, Czechs knew big, rich US did not need
                                their trade, and they in turn could live without their gold or
                                    <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> (he mentioned <gloss

                                their government considered adequate in 1961 and Czechs got their
                                gold; then relations could develop more fully.</item>

                        <p>The current situation in Czechoslovakia may deteriorate to the point that
                            UN involvement is inevitable, or desirable from the US point of view.
                            This paper discusses how the UN might become involved; what the UN might
                            hope to accomplish; and what role the US should take in the process.</p>
                        <p>The sudden loss of Czechoslovakia's recently acquired freedom should the
                            Soviets reassert control would inevitably provoke strong reactions in
                            many parts of the world—even among those accustomed to the post-war
                            division of Europe and more concerned with non-European colonial
                            issues.</p>
                        <p>According to Czechoslovakian announcement, Soviet forces now in
                            Czechoslovakia are to begin their withdrawal on Saturday, July 13.<note

                                19–30.</note> The question arises whether they actually will
                            withdraw, and if they do not, what then may occur within Czechoslovakia.
                            The desirability and probability of recourse to the UN depends on how
                            the Soviets proceed.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Soviet war of nerves now underway, accompanied by a Soviet refusal to
                            withdraw its troops from Czechoslovakia or partial withdrawal and
                            re-introduction might quickly lead to a confrontation between the two
                            countries. We thus may be suddenly faced with a situation in which the
                            Czech government appeals to the UN or other external sources for help,
                            or violence flares.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the issue may be somewhat less clearcut. It is
                            possible, though unlikely, that the Soviets might replace the <persName
                                corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName> regime with a pro-Moscow faction.
                            It is possible that <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName> is
                            playing this on the side of the Russians. In either circumstance it
                            might be difficult to engage the UN. Moreover, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName> might try to avoid UN involvement
                            and keep the whole problem in a Warsaw Pact context.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Whatever efforts might be made by the Secretary General, the Security
                            Council, or the General Assembly (as discussed below), the fact <pb
                                n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0233"/>remains that the UN would not
                            be able to take effective action against the Soviets. The primary
                            purpose for involving the UN would be to expose Soviet brutality and
                            catalyze international criticism of the Soviets, as a means of exerting
                            some restraint on them.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">

                        </p>
                        <p>It would be preferable for Czechoslovakia itself, or a sympathetic
                            Eastern European neighbor (Romania or Yugoslavia) to raise the issue at
                            the UN. For the US to do so might risk the appearance of ulterior
                            motives on our part, or of a cynical effort to manipulate a marginal
                            matter to our own purposes. Possibly even worse would be for us to
                            appear to be giving an implied commitment to help the Czechs.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, in the event of outright Soviet intervention and Czech
                            resistance, the US would probably take a leading role at the UN (if only
                            because of domestic political pressures) either by introducing the
                            question or by strongly supporting UN consideration if someone else
                            moved first on Czechoslovakia's behalf.</p>
                        <p>Because of Great Power involvement, the Secretary General would hesitate
                            to undertake any role in the matter, especially on his own initiative.
                            Because of the Soviet veto, the Security Council could not realistically
                            take any meaningful decisions. Nevertheless, the first recourse would be
                            to the Security Council, the appropriate UN organ. Assuming sufficient
                            sympathy among the membership for the fate of this small Central
                            European nation, the General Assembly might be able to come up with some
                            useful recommendations. The degree to which the United States took an
                            active role in the process would depend on the general UN reaction.</p>

                        <p>The possibility of Russian military intervention in Czechoslovakia is a
                            matter of basic concern to the United States. Ambassador <persName

                                >NPT</gloss> and set back the trend towards détente in Europe. Its
                            effect on our relations with the Soviet Union would probably reduce the
                            chance for a peaceful settlement in the Middle East and Viet-Nam,
                            although it is conceivable that the Russians would make concessions in
                            those two areas in return for our neutrality with regard to
                            Czechoslovakia. On net, Soviet armed intervention in Czechoslovakia
                            would probably change the political atmosphere fundamentally in ways
                            that could harm our <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0235"/>interests.
                            If the Czech government and people resist and call on the UN and <gloss

                            extraordinarily dangerous dilemma. It would be difficult to explain why
                            the UN Charter protects Korea against aggression, but not
                            Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia is surely in the Soviet sphere of
                            influence. But that fact hardly justifies murder in broad daylight. And
                            if fighting broke out in Eastern Europe, the evolution of events could
                            get completely out of hand. We should not forget that Russian soldiers
                            fought with the Hungarian revolutionaries in 1956.</p>

                            process of liberalization to proceed in Eastern Europe, the political
                            atmosphere should improve fundamentally, in ways most favorable to us.
                            Poland would almost surely follow the Czech example. Ulbricht would be
                            isolated. New possibilities for a settlement in Europe would be opened.
                            We could hope for a toning down of Soviet imperialism in the Middle East
                            and elsewhere. The Soviet leaders responsible for the failure of Soviet
                            policy in Eastern Europe might well be thrown out, as <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was, to be replaced by
                            leaders who would at least be weaker for a time than the present
                            group.</p>
                        <p>Since we have an immense national interest in a Russian decision not to
                            intervene, and would face unforeseeable risks if they do, I believe that
                            we should seriously consider the British suggestion of doing everything
                            possible at this point to deter the Russians from such a step. The
                            contrary argument is that any expression of interest on our part would
                            convince the Russians that we are behind Czech policy, and would harden
                            their decision to wipe out a dangerous heresy with their tanks. I think
                            much depends on what we say and who says it. I have always felt that
                            Dulles' public statement in 1956<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2">Apparently a
                                reference to Eisenhower's October 31, 1956, statement; see <ref
                                    target="#d60fn4">footnote 4, Document 60</ref>.</note> (that we
                            would under no circumstances move in Eastern Europe) was a profound
                            mistake. At a minimum, uncertainty on that point would have been
                            preferable. We must not make any threats in this situation, or take
                            positions that would confirm Russian suspicions. But we might still be
                            able to affect the decision by carefully planned, and entirely
                            conciliatory secret messages.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, we have made great exertions to revitalize <gloss

                            affecting European security. I believe the British suggestion in that
                            regard should be followed up, not only at the level of the Permanent
                            Representatives, but through a meeting of higher officials in Brussels,
                            to be followed, if intervention occurs, by the establishment of an
                            action group representing a number of interested governments in

                                <item>We are deeply concerned by charges in the Soviet press that
                                    the United States has participated in any way in the internal
                                    affairs of Czechoslovakia, or had any part whatever in recent
                                    political events in that country. The fact that such charges
                                    have been made, and made publicly, can only heighten
                                    tension.</item>
                                <label>B.</label>
                                <item>We can assure the Soviet government most categorically that we
                                    have done nothing in Czechoslovakia, and have played no part in
                                    these events. Our position on Czechoslovakia is a matter of
                                    record. It has been and remains our policy to respect in every
                                    way the independence and integrity of all states. We ask only
                                    that others exercise parallel restraint.</item>

                                <item>We hope and believe that rumors of Soviet military
                                    intervention in Czechoslovakia are equally unfounded. Such a
                                    step could set in train tendencies whose consequences it would
                                    be nearly impossible to predict. It would be irresponsible on
                                    our part if we did not bring to the attention of the Soviet
                                    government our conviction that such a course would imperil
                                    recent progress towards détente, and intensify the futile and
                                    burdensome arms race.</item>

                                <item>It is our conviction, on the contrary, that the present trend
                                    towards détente represents the profound national interests of
                                    the United States and, we hope and believe, those of the Soviet
                                    Union as well. It is in no one's interest to reverse that trend.
                                    We believe that the path towards a secure and peaceful
                                    settlement in Europe is that represented by our proposals, and
                                    those of the other members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                            strengthen the hand of those in the Soviet Union who oppose
                            “bridge-building” and détente as imperialist tricks to subvert Eastern
                            Europe. On the other hand, the first sentence of E should be put on the
                            record, if we give the Soviets any piece of paper.</p>

                        <p>I recommend also that the Soviet invitation to <persName

                            He would be going, obviously, to discuss Viet-Nam. Such a visit could be
                            interpreted as a signal that we don't care what the Soviets do in
                            Czechoslovakia, but will pursue détente through thick or thin. We should
                            therefore make it clear to the Russians, privately, that we are sending
                                <persName>Averell</persName> on the assumption that there will be no

                            states. He would, of course, be instructed to follow up at the highest
                            level on the implications of our aide-mémoire with respect to <gloss

                                xml:id="d68fn2">Dated June 20. (Ibid.)</note> The answer is that the
                            prospects for meaningful contact are not very good and this appears to
                            be by Czech choice. Smrkovsky is probably the most approachable among
                            the hierarchy but he is too shrewd to become involved with us without
                            checking with the Foreign Ministry which would put things back in
                            present sterile channel.</p>
                        <p>2. It is on my conscience whether we should indicate we would be prepared
                            to help in any way regime thought fit. This could be done through
                            informal inquiry to Snejdarek, Director of Institute for International
                            Politics and Economics, who seems to stand close to important party
                            circles or through Austrians whose standing is now probably highest
                            among Western countries. My feeling of the moment is that we should not
                            undertake this move. Once it got into formal channels we would run <pb
                                n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0239"/>the risk of being charged with
                            hypocrisy since Czechs could claim they have made it amply clear what
                            they wish from U.S., namely the elimination of alleged economic
                            discrimination.</p>
                        <p>3. Believe Czechs are realistic in realizing limits on US action, i.e.,
                            no military support or massive economic aid. They are aware of
                            reciprocal inhibitions stemming from Viet-Nam war. Cool official
                            relations also enhance their standing in Communist camp. They know in
                            any case they can count on considerable benefit of US public
                            understanding. Secretary's statement was helpful in making this
                                point.<note n="3" xml:id="d68fn3">Not further identified.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Despite Western press stories playing up alleged concern over
                            US-Soviet tacit collusion over Czechoslovakia, regime does not seem to
                            be too unhappy with present US stance, viz., rude Pravo article

                            bear on present situation. For time being Czechs seem to prefer handling
                            their troubles within the Communist orbit. But suggestion I have to
                            offer is <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> might play up US public

                        <p>4751. 1. Although there are many pros and cons I am convinced that our
                            present posture on Czech affair is the correct one particularly in <pb
                                n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0240"/>absence any request from Czechs
                            for a change. They should be in the best position to judge effects of
                            any actions or statements on our part. Any appeal to the Soviets would
                            necessarily reveal weakness of our position by what we would not and
                            could not say. Moreover, I believe that on balance such appeal would
                            strengthen the hands of the hardliners rather than those who oppose
                            intervention.</p>
                        <p>2. Soviets have left themselves little ground to retreat and have already
                            paid a big price in the Communist as well as the free world by their
                            crude handling of this affair. If Czechs face them down, Soviet prestige
                            will suffer and other members of the camp will be encouraged toward
                            greater independence. If they use force the free world will be deeply
                            shocked, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strengthened, hope of
                            reducing military expend-iture by agreement with US jeopardized, etc.
                            Moreover internal dissatisfaction with Soviet leadership would increase.
                            Their only hope is that Czechs will back down and even if this happens,
                            as it may well do, Soviet efforts to unify Communist camp under their
                            leadership will be thwarted. In Soviet practice serious errors demand at
                            least a scapegoat and regardless of how the Czech affair comes out this
                            may well be the beginning of a process leading to the fall of Brezhnev,
                            Suslov and others.</p>

                                >Dobrynin</persName> to come to see him because he had just been in

                            Soviet newspapers and on Soviet radio which seemed to imply U.S.
                            involvement in the Czech situation. He said he had no paper to give the
                            Ambassador but would merely make an oral statement. The Secretary went
                            on to say that he wished to express the seriousness with which the U.S.
                            regarded accusations of this kind. For example, he referred to an
                            article in <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> on July 19 in which it spoke of
                            a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Western plot against
                            Czechoslovakia involving the Pentagon and <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                                >CIA</gloss>. He wished to state emphatically that there was
                            absolutely no truth in this allegation. A further statement in regard to
                            arms caches had appeared in the Soviet press and he had even seen
                            something questioning the authenticity of these arms caches by some
                            Czechs. He referred to a Bulgarian newspaper account which indicated one
                            of the arms caches had been barely concealed, thereby suggesting it had
                            been placed there for easier detection. He referred also to a Moscow
                            radio broadcast of July 22 of an alleged plot by Bonn and the U.S. in
                            regard to Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that no one knew better than members of the
                            Soviet Embassy the restraint the U.S. had exercised in regard to Czech
                            developments. He said we had not wished to involve ourselves directly in
                            this matter, that the U.S. had been attempting to develop better
                            relationships with Eastern European countries as well as with the Soviet
                            Union. However, in regard to these current charges he would like to make
                            three points: <list>

                                    Congressmen and Senators were making statements and becoming
                                    very concerned about them. (<persName corresp="#p_DAF1"

                                    U.S. had created a part of this agitation. He mentioned that Mr.

                                <item>The feelings of the American people were perfectly
                                    understandable in matters of this kind. In fact they go back to
                                    Thomas Jefferson and the Declaration of Independence (which
                                    parenthetically the Secretary said ante-dated Karl Marx by about
                                    one hundred years) that set forth the right of peoples to order
                                    their own affairs themselves. The U.S. Government had not sought
                                    to involve itself in this situation, but there should be no
                                    misapprehension as to the feelings and sympathies of the
                                    American people.</item>

                        </p>
                        <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0242"/>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned that this was the first time that anybody had
                            spoken officially to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> about the Czech situation. He added that the
                            U.S. Government had not wished to point out that undoubtedly the Soviet
                            Government had a highly professional intelligence service which would
                            make it clear that there was absolutely no truth to these allegations.
                            We therefore were entitled to wonder what particular purpose was being
                            achieved in their dissemination and whether or not this might be a
                            pretext to lay a basis for some future action against Czechoslovakia. If
                            this happened we would deeply regret it and it could not possibly have
                            anything but a very negative effect on our relations, all the more so if
                            the U.S. was to be presented as a scapegoat.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that both he and the President took these allegations
                            very seriously and hoped that the Ambassador would be able to obtain
                            from his government an explanation of these totally erroneous charges.
                            He then asked the Ambassador if he had any questions. The Ambassador
                            said he could only say there was no question of any form of pretext or
                            excuse. Beyond that he could only say that he would report this matter
                            to his government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then discussed how it would be handled with the press. (The
                            Secretary had received a telephone call to say the Ambassador's car had
                            been seen by the press.) He said that we were planning to state that the
                            Secretary had asked the Ambassador to come in to take up with him the
                            charges appearing in the Soviet press, to refute them, and to ask for an
                            explanation. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he
                            thought that this was perhaps a little too detailed but had no
                            suggestions as to how to handle it.</p>

                                <item>—Czech defection would weaken the Warsaw Pact threat to

                                <item>—Czech neutralization would justify some reduction in <gloss

                                    war.</item>

                        <p>While of course it is not conclusive I must say I don't like the tone of
                            the Soviet and Satellite press in regard to Czechoslovakia. Not only is
                            the tone shriller, but for the first time an authoritative Soviet
                            journal, i.e., <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>, has stated that there is
                            going on in Prague preparations for a coup which the Czech leaders do
                            not seem to be aware of, and that action is necessary to forestall this
                            coup. There is also a reference in the <hi rend="italic">Red Star</hi>
                            to the fact that the combat readiness of the Soviet army increases day
                            by day and hour by hour. There has been no announcement made of the date
                            of the Politburo meetings, and there is even an indication in an
                            American correspondent's story from Moscow that diplomatic circles there
                            are beginning to wonder if the meetings would come off.</p>
                        <p>There is also the increased Soviet mobilization and the report that at
                            least two, if not three, Soviet divisions moved south from the Berlin
                            area towards the Czech border. Of course this could all be part of the
                            war of nerves, but I think something to watch is whether or not there is
                            any serious indication that the proposed meeting is off.</p>
                        <p>I find the military preparations somewhat excessive for a war of nerves,
                            and it could be that in addition to making final preparation for a move
                            into Czechoslovakia the Soviets are preparing for any eventuality which
                            might arise.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing is pure speculation, but I thought I should tell you that I
                            think the scene has darkened a bit since yesterday.</p>

                            ever write that editorial on the subject of Czechoslovakia? To do
                            anything there looks very dim.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Any time you want to call
                            me, just pick up the phone and call me because the situation changes on
                            a daily basis. The issues between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union
                            are really fundamental issues. The Soviets are deeply concerned about
                            the future of the entire Communist world in Eastern Europe as a result
                            of what is happening in Czechoslovakia. They raised the question on the
                            monopolization of the Communist Party. The Czechs raised the question on
                            the arrangements within the solidarity of the Warsaw Pact. They have
                            eliminated censorship to the extent that there is more free expression
                            now in Czechoslovakia than there has ever been present in any Communist
                            country including Yugoslavia. I think the Soviets are concerned both on
                            the security grounds of a country that is on their border and also
                            borders on the west. But they're even more concerned about the
                            possibility of contagion—how is Czechoslovakia affecting Poland,
                            Hungary, West and East Germany and even the Soviet Union itself where
                            they have important troubles with their young people and with their
                            nationalities. Our people who visit the Soviet Union or live there say
                            there's enormous apathy around Moscow. It is just like a dead lump of
                            dough and it's stirring all through that part of the world. Matter of
                            fact, John Foster Dulles used to talk about this possibility in '53 and
                            '54. Now publicly we've taken the line that these charges by the Soviet
                            Union that we are somehow concocting this thing in Czechoslovakia are
                            false. The Soviet Union knows them to be false and that, of course, the
                            Soviet Union knows what the American people think about an issue of this
                            sort when it is raised anywhere in the world. We think <pb n="219"
                                xml:id="pg_219" facs="0247"/>people ought to determine their own
                            affairs. Privately we have been much more stiff than that with them and
                            have specifically said so. Now look, if you're trying to build up a
                            pretext by your charges against us for action against Czechoslovakia,
                            cut it out because that's going to have very serious effect on our
                            relations. They denied they're doing it which is sort of interesting,
                            but nevertheless now on the problem that he will face down there during
                            at least three or four days will be how to handle it in such a way not
                            to get in the way of the Czechs, not to hurt the Czechs. Now we've been
                            told by the Czechs this is their final remark that they consider that
                            our public handling of this question has been about right from their
                            point of view. If we would go on much more dramatically in supporting
                            the Czechs this would create real problems for them in their attempt to
                            deal with the Russians. Now there is another reason why we might want to
                            be a little careful about this problem. The chances are that the Czechs
                            will make some compromises here to keep the Russians off their backs. It
                            may be we pledge fidelity to the Warsaw pact, it may be some changes in
                            personnel, it may be the reimposition of censorship. We just don't know.
                            But you just might want—before you lock up any comments you make about
                            Eastern Europe, you just might want to give me or give Chip <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> a telephone call and see if
                            there are any later developments that could possibly have any bearing on
                            what you are thinking about. On the general idea of détente—this thing
                            the so called détente—there's very little basis for any generalization
                            on it. On the one side we have such things as the civil air agreement
                            and the Consular Agreement, the Space Treaty and the nonproliferation
                            treaty and the possibility of talks on the strategic offensive and
                            defensive missiles. But on the other hand you have got Berlin and
                            Germany and Vietnam and the Middle East so you've got many dangerous
                            questions that have not been resolved. So one can't speak of détente,
                            one can't speak of the opposite. It's pragmatic kind of situations.

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: You've got to look at
                            it, too, of the possibility of there being some serious danger inherent
                            in it. One quick reaction I would have would be that if by chance
                            Czechoslovakia is still a pending problem, I don't believe I'd go near
                            Kosygin during the time that Czechoslovakia is still hot. I don't. You
                            could get caught up in that and I'm just afraid it would be difficult
                            for you to extricate yourself. You could have a talk with Kosygin and
                            the day you talked with him Soviet troops could move on Czechoslovakia
                            or the day after you left, troops could move in Czechoslovakia. It would
                            be, they'd be tied together in some way, whether that would suit
                            Kosygin's attitude or not, I don't know. I think that we have to be
                            careful about the reasons why the President was seeing Kosygin at this
                            time. Is it because the President has a new plan that he is taking to
                            Kosygin vis-á-vis Vietnam? Is there something new he wants to take to
                            him? Is it because the President's concerned about the Middle East—some
                            development there? Is he concerned about <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>? You know there's so much cooking right now. As far as
                            starting off with Kosygin on a discussion of strategic limitation and
                            ultimate reduction, I don't know. Right at this time, Mr. President, I
                            wonder whether that's advisable. These are going to be long, difficult,
                            exceedingly complex negotiations. Whether the President and Kosygin can
                            do anything much at the very beginning of it, I don't know. I think that
                            the general approach would be, well—I just wonder what they can do about
                            it. And I think we have to be careful. The time that the President
                            selects to see Kosygin. I would hope that there'd be a time when we
                            didn't have a situation quite as inflammable as it is. I'm thinking of
                            the Czechoslovakian problem. I think that's a terribly difficult
                            problem. I know we can't get in it. I feel some concern that we can.
                            Czechoslovakia is supposedly a free country and they can be under the
                            heel just like Hungary was. I don't know for instance whether somebody
                            might decide to bring this up in the Security Council in the
                            UN—Czechoslovakia. Maybe some member of the Security Council could
                            decide to bring it up. That would tend to exaggerate it. So, a second
                            point I'm making is to sound a note of basic caution about going to see
                                <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0249"/>Kosygin right at this time.
                            I think it must be watched with great care. The third point I have:
                            After Dean left Saturday afternoon, I just noted down thoughts that I
                            had. Just in my own handwriting—I've not given them even to the girls.
                            The third point I'd like to make has to do with the Convention. [Here
                            follow 4 pages of discussion of the Democratic National Convention and
                            Vietnam.]</p>
                        <p>[<persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>:] This is very prominent
                            in my mind, as I look ahead. At this time, Mr. President, with the
                            condition existing in Czechoslovakia, with existing in Vietnam we're
                            waiting for the other shoe to drop over there, I can see more danger in
                            a visit with Kosygin at this time, then I can see benefit. Now I think
                            there will come a time when the President can see Kosygin. Right now it
                            just seems to me that it's tempting fate too severely.</p>
                        <p>President: What time do you see that it could come?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: Well, I think there'll
                            be a resolution of the problem in Czechoslovakia. These things don't go
                            on indefinitely. The President is still President. Let's see, August,
                            September, October, November, December, you're still President for six
                            months, until the 20th of January. That's almost six months off. I don't
                            know, it could be in a week.</p>
                        <p>President: You think it would probably be all right to have meetings in
                            November and December?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: It wouldn't bother me a
                            bit. It wouldn't bother me a bit. You're going right on being President
                            and you're not bothering with politics. The fact that there's some new
                            man or something, that wouldn't bother me a particle. I think in maybe a
                            week, it could be a week. Czechoslovakia would be resolved one way or
                            another. It could be two weeks, or three weeks, but I think it's going
                            to be resolved that this thing has gotten so acute now, so inflammatory,
                            that I think they're going to lance this abscess one way or another and
                            I think it will be out of the way. Now, I think that we will all learn
                            during the month of August whether there's going to be another series of
                            attacks from the enemy in Vietnam. Maybe it will come and maybe it
                            won't, and I think we get that out of the way so that that doesn't get
                            too involved in it. It wouldn't disturb me at all if the talks on
                            strategic weapons control were to start at some other level. It's going
                            to go on for some time. I don't know that it has too much significance
                            in having it started by Kosygin and the President and I'm not even sure
                            that it's particularly valuable to just confine it to that at the
                            starting. I think that the President when he goes to see, or arranges to
                            see Kosygin under the proper circumstances in which Kosygin's
                            comfortable, I would hope the two of you would be able to sit down and
                            cover the entire mosaic of our problems. An announcement could be made
                            ahead of time to that effect and something after it that could come out.
                            Right now I believe that if I were Kosygin with this real nose bleed on
                            my hands with <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0250"/>Czechoslovakia I
                            think almost the last person I would want to see right now would be
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>President: Yes, I think there is something to that. I'm not necessarily
                            trying to help him though.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Well, Mr. President, I'd
                            like to comment very briefly.</p>
                        <p>President: I agree. Let me comment on what <persName corresp="#p_CC1"
                                >Clark</persName> is saying. I think there is no reason why we have
                            to act until the Czechoslovakia situation is cleared. As I indicated,
                            that's number one. I don't know how. If it's two weeks, that's another
                            matter. I would expect maybe it wouldn't be that long. I don't know. I
                            can't tell. But I don't think it's essential. We don't say that I don't
                            think that the President and Kosygin sit down together. We have though
                            for four years urged this step upon them and we finally got them to
                            agree now that there will be a meeting within a month or a month and a
                            half. I would like to forthrightly respond to that and accept it and
                            give him my views of what ought to happen. And I think there may be some
                            merit in the four days of the Convention there waiting until it's over
                            with, I don't care. And it may be that he won't want to start at this
                            level. I'd rather think he wouldn't. Although I would like to because I
                            would think that that would be the way. But if not, if you want to
                            modify that part of it if that is a—, then you might say, or at the
                            Foreign Minister level. One or the other of us ought to start it off.
                            And I'm willing to rewrite the letter and use his phrase—not ours.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Month, month and a half.</p>
                        <p>President: Yes, and I'm willing to and also add that if this doesn't suit
                            you, that we'd be glad for the Foreign Ministers to start it off. We do
                            think it is of sufficient importance. The very first proposal that we
                            made to the Soviet Union we insisted on time and date and place and
                            subject. There is so much that is pending that needs the attention of
                            both countries. What I'm terribly afraid of is—I'm afraid that by our
                            sitting with our hands in our pockets, just merrily, merrily going
                            along, just reacting to all of their initiatives and their propaganda
                            and their party line that we just finally catch ourselves just signing
                            on which we have been doing most of the time and I think we're likely to
                            be doing it again. I think we'll be having a Council meeting here in a
                            week or so and everybody will pretty well agree in general that we ought
                            to cut out something else we're doing in deference to these folks. That
                            is what I am fearful of.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Well, I agree with Clark. I
                            think you do, too, about the possible connection between this
                            Czechoslovakia business. I think, myself, that the chances are—</p>
                        <p>President: We won't have waited today if it hadn't agreed on that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: That's right. That's right.
                            I think we're likely to see here some sort of answer on the Czech
                            business before then.</p>
                        <p>President: I think so.</p>
                        <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0251"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We did put in this draft:
                            “If the general situation permits,” a phrase that would cover the Czech
                            business in our minds that if things really start in Czechoslovakia we'd
                            just ourselves pull back even if Kosygin accepted this.</p>
                        <p>President: That is what that was intended to do. But I don't think that
                            we even need to dispatch the letter until we see a little clearer than
                            we do now.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: That's right.</p>
                        <p>President: I said that last weekend and I didn't ask for this meeting
                            today.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: I asked for it. Now on this
                            other—what would such a meeting be about. I think that we can make it
                            pretty clear that it is about offensive and defensive missiles. That is
                            a question which everybody knows the President's worked on very hard and
                            worked on it personally. He tried very hard at Glassboro to get these
                            talks started. He's also worked hard on the non-proliferation treaty
                            which has in it an obligation on the part of the nuclear powers to get
                            going and negotiate in good faith the elimination of the arms race. So
                            from that point of view it seems to me that it would militate in favor
                            of the President's launching these discussions. There's another factor
                            and that is that, Clark, you may not like this one particularly. I think
                            if the President initiated the discussions, this would be a sign to what
                            General Eisenhower called the military industrial complex that Goddamn
                            it, getting an agreement to limit offensive and defensive missiles is
                            the national policy of the United States. We want people to think about
                            how you do it and not think about how you'll avoid doing it. Looking
                            ahead you look at these tens of billions that are going down this rat
                            hole if we don't find an answer to this, you see. So there's an internal
                            commitment involving the President's study. Now the danger is—the court
                            of last resort getting it into session and Kosygin could turn up there
                            with demands on Berlin or something—after all
                                <persName>Khrushchev</persName> did drop the Berlin crisis in
                            President <persName>Kennedy</persName>'s lap when they met in Vienna.
                            This did not happen in Glassboro partly because Kosygin was over here in
                            the United Nations on a Middle East where, frying some fishes on his own
                            at that time. And therefore, this was not racked up. There's little
                            danger. I think it is not as great now as it might have been earlier if
                            nothing had happened. So this is why—subject to Czechoslovakia—I myself
                            come down on the balanced judgment that there would be real merit in the
                            two meetings if it could be done under the appropriate
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: I find no disagreement
                            with that, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean</persName>, I think that
                            President <persName>Kennedy</persName>'s meeting in Vienna with
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was a
                            calamity.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: It was.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: Boy, it was a real zero
                            from President <persName>Kennedy</persName>'s standpoint.</p>
                        <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0252"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: Now I think conditions
                            have changed. I think that the Soviets have shown an inclination to find
                            some basis of cooperation with us. That's a very interesting sentence in
                            the last letter of Kosygin that we will both find as we get into this
                            that a savings can be effected to a very substantial degree.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: I would be for the President
                            having a chance to talk with him very informally without pretending that
                            the main subject is about Vietnam and about the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: I would have no
                            difficulty with that.</p>
                        <p>President: You know originally I thought we ought to say there and I took
                            it out.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>President: This is not the only subject.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: This refers now to—it will
                            also give us a chance to discuss quietly and informally some of the
                            problems or tensions that you referred to.</p>
                        <p>President: That just polished up, the very [inaudible] the three matters
                            that we wanted to talk about and that also left us a getting out place
                            even on Czechoslovakia or any other developments after it was set. And I
                            don't think I would want to specify that I would not want to attend a
                            meeting. Now, I don't see that this would do the damage to the
                            Democratic Party that <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clark</persName> does.
                            I have a different viewpoint. I think it's the best thing that we could
                            do for the Democratic Party, whoever is nominated at that time. I don't
                            think we necessarily need to go at that specific moment, but I think
                            most of them will be pretty glad that we're having a meeting. I would
                            just leave it more in his hands on the month to month and a half
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: All right.</p>
                        <p>President: But I think we could do that after we see the situation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: I would agree, too, that it
                            would be of great benefit to the Democratic Party if it didn't take
                            place on those very days that they were having their Convention.</p>
                        <p>President: Well their Convention is going to have all the television
                            every hour. This meeting is not going to be taking much of it. And I
                            would doubt that he would set the meeting. I would just leave it and say
                            anytime within the month or month and half he mentioned, it would be
                            agreeable with us. I'd be pretty agreeable to hear suggestions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: All right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: Does he have in mind
                            that the President would like to start it off, personally with Kosygin
                            because he said nothing about that in his last reply. And the President
                            I think said nothing about that in this one. Does he?</p>
                        <p>President: Yes.</p>
                        <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0253"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: Oh, I see. I didn't
                            notice it.</p>
                        <p>President: He understood at Glassboro that we were pressing on this very
                            hard, a little history would help us. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> wrote to me in December '63 a rather broad
                            long letter and we responded January the 16th, '64 in which we discussed
                            the perils of armament in the world and the two powers poised at each
                            other and how much it would cost us and how much good could be done if
                            we could only approach this problem of disarmament and particularly if
                            we could have some agreement that would bring about the
                            non-proliferation treaty. That was number one on the list and we listed
                            a series of reductions in our armed strength and in our future
                            investments in armaments. And we stuck it right up to him and said that
                            we very much want to do this and then we followed that with a series of
                            specific moves where we reduced our atomic reactors and asked him to do
                            likewise and he held off to the last moment until ours was announced. I
                            was actually at the microphone speaking when he notified us that he
                            would issue an announcement at the same time. We suggested 2 o'clock on
                            Tuesday. I started speaking at one forty-five and we hadn't heard from
                            him and about one fifty-five they brought us a note that he was going to
                            announce it at 2 o'clock, right at the last minute. He went out and our
                            people, we pursued this up until we went in there with our bombing in
                            '65 and things kind of tapered off. At Glassboro it heated up again,
                            very strong. And we took the initiative and just almost wrestled him to
                            have a meeting and said anytime, anywhere we'll send our men to Moscow
                            or we'll meet in Geneva or we'll come back to Glassboro. We'll do
                            anything, but this we must do. We thought we got a tentative, implied
                            acceptance then and we thought it would be rather soon. He got back and
                            subsequently came along and implied it again. What did he say in that
                            language we got back? We announced it the day Bobby
                                <persName>Kennedy</persName> made a speech and we didn't call him up
                            to find out he was going to speak the same day or not so they charged us
                            with bad motives. You remember that don't you.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Yes, I remember it.</p>
                        <p>President: There was some indication that they would meet with us again
                            but they never would set a date. So we have kept shoving 'em all during
                            that period. Now we've come along and Kosygin has said yes a month or
                            six weeks. Now if we don't want to talk or if we are hesitant to talk or
                            if we want to just let it go through the regular channels of Bill Foster
                            at Geneva. That's one thing. That's now my view. It hasn't been for four
                            years and I think this is most important we could ever do.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Rusk</hi>: Mr. President, I tried to get Kosygin to
                            accept <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in Moscow the
                            following Wednesday after Glassboro. Well, they gave us that story—can't
                            come then. Well then name a date. Pressed them very hard on this.</p>
                        <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0254"/>
                        <p>President: Now, it's been a year, during that time he's put off and put
                            off during that year. During that time I've had to go up with my budget
                            and I've had to put the ABM in the budget to stick it, to hold firm and
                            not weaken with everybody wanting to shimmy a little bit. And then when
                            he got up, a lot want to run away from it after it gets up there, as
                            you've observed with Symington, and so forth, the fight that went on in
                            the Senate. And now he's still holding back one Goddamn year and not
                            doing anything and finally when the Senate vote gets out of the way and
                            it looks like we are going ahead, and we hold out the hand of peace here
                            but the hand of strength here so we're going to go on, we don't want to
                            do this we'd like to save this 50 billion that the two of us are
                            spending, but he's just got no sense at all. We'll go on. We are not
                            going to let you destroy us. We're not going to let you be defended and
                            us not defended. Then he comes up and says I'll see you in a month or
                            month and a half. That's where we are. Then we say well we can't do it
                            because we've got a Convention. That doesn't appeal to me. I'd go right
                            back to him and say that you suggest a month or a month and a half and
                            to me that is agreeable and a month or a month and a half is agreeable
                            and we would suggest it on this level and if you're not satisfied, if
                            you don't want to do it on that level, well then I'll arrange for the
                            Foreign Ministers to meet.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: All right.</p>
                        <p>President: And then I'd let him say if he picks August 25th I wouldn't be
                            worried. I don't think he will, but I'm sure that we can so arrange the
                            agenda that we could get our man nominated and the American people would
                            have all the Democratic Convention that they want. I think they will
                            have. I think it will be the thing that is uppermost. We talked a lot
                            with these folks. You have met with Gromyko a good many times. I have
                            met with Gromyko and with Kosygin and it hasn't turned the world upside
                            down. We know, just like <persName>Averell</persName> and Vance meeting
                            with them over there, what I'm really worried about is they're more in
                            command of our forces that I am. That's what really troubles me. These
                            damned cables coming in like that. Because I read this record and I see
                            these pictures and I see Javits get up and I see Morgan get up and I see
                            all of them get up and I see the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>
                            editorial and it just fits in to this whole damn facet. If I hadn't been
                            watching it for four or five years I wouldn't be worried about it but
                            it's not accidental. And I don't want to get hung on the rack. I just
                            don't want to get caught on it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: All right.</p>
                        <p>President: I want to make it so firm and loud I don't want my people to
                            serve that up to me and then have <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1"
                                >Goldberg</persName> come along here and saying well as you know I
                            felt this way.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: They can well concentrate on
                            trying to get another private meeting, get an answer from Hanoi.</p>
                        <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0255"/>
                        <p>President: I think we'd better show them that it's just a few speeches
                            and pressure are not going to do it. They are beginning to think we're
                            jelly and we'll do it and I don't understand why he sent this wire after
                            we told him how we felt about it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: The trouble is that
                            negotiators habitually—</p>
                        <p>President: It's not negotiations, hell—</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Get action to take the next
                            step. That's one of the problems about American negotiators they're
                            always in a little bit more of a hurry than the other side. I think they
                                also—<persName>Averell</persName> is making some judgments about
                            politics here at home.</p>
                        <p>President: A good deal and it looks like a good deal of it in Vietnam—the
                            battle strategy too.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Mr. President, on the longer
                            range negotiations for this thing I'd just like to put it in the back of
                            your mind. I think Clark and I would agree that the two chief people
                            from our respective departments might be Brown. He's very knowledgeable
                            in this field.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_VHC1">Harold</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Harold Brown and Butch
                            Fisher he's with ACDA. I think we also feel there ought to be a
                            principal negotiator on top of them. Maybe in the State Department. A
                            man from the Defense Department would be the principal negotiator on
                            disarmament I think it would be a mistake and the Pentagon would feel it
                            even more strongly than I for ACDA to be the number one fellow on this
                            particular subject. Now one possibility would be to bring
                                <persName>Tommy Thompson</persName> out of Moscow for these talks in
                            Geneva and let him be there for three or four weeks for the first round.
                            And then they're bound to close off the talks for awhile and study each
                            other's position in more detail. Tommy is not doing a great deal in
                            Moscow these days and he would be a in a position to follow up. So he
                            would be one possibility. Another possibility would be that is after the
                            Foreign Ministers review would get through with it, another possibility
                            would be Chet Bowen [Chip Bohlen]. I think in terms of negotiations and
                            this kind of thing. <persName>Tommy Thompson</persName> would be, in
                            some respect, a more competent negotiator because he's very familiar
                            with all of these matters having worked with the Pentagon for years in
                            that Deputy job over in my shop. I just wanted to mention that to you,
                            because other names may occur to you to head up the delegations but we
                            would suggest a head of the delegation plus Brown and Fisher and their
                            respective staffs.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: We have to bring the
                            Joint Chiefs along on this one, as you would know, they'd be very
                            important and our record must be absolutely clear. They feel the
                            responsibility, of course, as we all do, protecting the security of this
                            country. They, I was telling Dean Saturday afternoon they paw the air
                            when Bill Foster's name is mentioned. They think Bill is very soft and
                            very fuzzy-headed. Now, Dean said, very frankly, well, <pb n="228"
                                xml:id="pg_228" facs="0256"/>anybody could be head of ACDA would be
                            viewed in that light by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                        <p>President: Just one second. [The President left the room.]</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: My guess is the Russians
                            will bite at the Foreign Ministers level like a [inaudible].</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: You mean the ACDA, the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff problem?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: No, I said if we go back to
                            the Russians to say, Kosygin himself, if not the Foreign Minister, I
                            think the Russians will bite at a Foreign Ministers meeting like a
                            shot.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: [whispering]: I don't
                            think Kosygin will see the President now with all his difficulties.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Because I don't see much of
                            a meeting between the two after November with the President-elect in the
                            wings. I think it ought to be before November. I think so too, I think
                            it should be before November. The problems the Russians have seem to be
                            Peking with Kosygin and the President meeting and all.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: I think they're awfully
                            sensitive about this too. And of course, they'll get a hell of a lot of
                            blast right now. Apparently, the President wants to start, however. Does
                            he? Does he want to start?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: Then, what is this
                            alternative? What would the Foreign Ministers meet about. Just meet
                            together to plan an agenda for the two?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Well, to deal with that, we
                            would try to agree on some general principles. [The President re-entered
                            the room.] And we would make a proposal that we're working on now. We'll
                            have it up to the President shortly after April—August 7th we hope.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: Just to finish this
                            other point, if the President were to designate Bill Foster to be the
                            chief negotiator then I think that he would be waited upon by Wheeler
                            and the rest of the Joint Chiefs and I think they say we can't go along
                            with it and there's no use taking on that kind of fight at the beginning
                            I think. I believe they'd feel better about Butch Fisher than they feel
                            about Bill Foster. I think they feel that Butch is a little harder nosed
                            than Bill is. At the same time if you were to suggest that Butch Fisher
                            was to be the chief negotiator I think that they'd be over here within
                            the hour saying let us tell you why this must not be. Wheeler felt so
                            strongly about it he called and made an appointment with me. He came and
                            talked to me about it. Told about all the experiences that they had had
                            with ACDA and it's one of those situations in which men get locked into
                            a state of mind after a certain number of years. Now whether there's
                            justification for it or not, I think it's beside the question. If it's a
                            state of mind, it's one that we don't have to take on.</p>

                            <item>Power: So far as the Soviet leaders are concerned, undoubtedly
                                one, if not their most important, concern is the preservation of
                                their own power. No one gets to the top in this system without an
                                unhealthy interest in power, and they can excuse their pursuit of it
                                by rationalizing that they and they alone can preserve the gains and
                                advance the aims of Communism. Ever since Lenin, Communism has meant
                                not only the exercise of power by a small group but also the
                                exclusive right to decide who should hold it. With the very rare
                                exceptions, such as <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                    >Khrushchev</persName>'s appeal to the Central Committee, this
                                has been confined to the small group now called the
                                Politburo.</item>

                            <item>The introduction of democratic processes in Czechoslovakia, even
                                if confined to the party, would threaten to undermine the whole
                                system. When freedom of the press and other forms of expression are
                                added to this, it is clear that, unless reversed, what the Czechs
                                will end up with is not what the Soviets mean by the term
                                Marxism-Leninism. In other words, a fundamental change is in
                                process. It is difficult to see how such a development could fail to
                                have serious repercussions on the other bloc countries, including
                                eventually the Soviet Union, or how the Soviet leaders can fail to
                                consider it a serious threat to their hold on power.</item>

                            <item>Security: The strategic location of Czechoslovakia must certainly
                                cause the Soviet military as well as political leaders concern over
                                the possible loss of this salient in the center of their East
                                European bunker zone. Although in an atomic age such considerations
                                of geography have diminished significance, they can still be
                                important for psychological reasons. For example, in a future Berlin
                                crisis the unavailability of Czech <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230"
                                    facs="0258"/>territory would make Soviet threats less credible.
                                Moreover if, as seems likely, the situation should develop where
                                Soviets could not count upon Czech military forces, this would make
                                Czechoslovakia a negative liability as Soviet forces would have to
                                be earmarked to control it.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Another aspect of security is the loss of classified information
                                that could leak out through a Czechoslovakia friendly to the West,
                                and the operations there of foreign agents which the Soviet press
                                has emphasized from the beginning of the crisis. Also of importance
                                is the possibility of Czechoslovakia providing an escape route for
                                East Germans, Poles and Hungarians desiring to reach the West.
                                Regardless of Czech Government policy, I can't imagine soldiers in a
                                relatively free Czechoslovakia shooting refugees fleeing across the
                                Czech-German border. Even if soldiers could be brought to shoot
                                escapees, I should think an underground railroad a likely
                                possibility. It is possibly this aspect and the possibility of
                                pressure on the Czech regime, other than a defense of the frontier,
                                that the Soviets would have in mind in any demand to station Soviet
                                troops on the Czech frontier with Western Germany.</item>

                            <item>Ideology: A great source of strength of Communism has always been
                                its flat assertion that there is only one truth and that Communism
                                provides all the answers. The appeal of this doctrine has already
                                been badly shaken by the Yugoslav and Chinese heresies. For
                                Czechoslovakia to add another would be to substitute a confusing
                                maze of cloverleafs for the one clear and straight road to
                                Communism. As their claim to be the true interpreters of the
                                doctrine is the basis of the Soviet leadership's claim to power, any
                                further doubt cast on the orthodox view of Communism is bound to be
                                of great concern to the Soviet leaders.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>The bloc: The Soviets have already shown the importance they
                                attach to the scheduled November meeting of Communist Parties and
                                their attempt to reassert their leadership over the Communist bloc
                                as well as over Communist Parties in the free world. Their ability
                                to do this was highly doubtful before their brutal pressure on the
                                Czechs. Now it would appear to be out the window. If to Yugoslav
                                independence and Romanian estrangement of foreign affairs is added a
                                successful Czech revolt against Soviet dictation of the internal
                                order, there could be little doubt that a further loosening of bloc
                                ties would follow. On the other hand if the Soviets, by using
                                whatever means are necessary, are able to restore an orthodox regime
                                in Czechoslovakia, they could at least for a time hope to
                                consolidate their hold over a smaller portion of the bloc. The
                                eventual price they would have to pay for this would, however,
                                doubtless be great, including their relations with non-ruling
                                Communist Parties.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>The past: An important factor in the Soviet attitude is their
                                desire to avoid opening the skeletons in the closet to public view
                                and to precipitate a showdown on the issue of Stalinism which they
                                have with such <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0259"/>effort and
                                strain managed to avoid. Although the Czechs while under existing
                                pressures may exercise sufficient voluntary restraint to defer this
                                issue, it would seem inescapable if a free press continues to exist
                                in Czechoslovakia. With the involvement of a number of current
                                Soviet leaders in Stalin's crimes, Czech remarks touching on this
                                issue are fighting words.</item>

                            <item>The future: While I will not in this message attempt to analyze
                                the many cons to Soviet attempts to restore an orthodox order in
                                Czechoslovakia, the foregoing considerations indicate, it seems to
                                me, that for the Soviets to accept the proposed changes in that
                                country would mean the beginning of the ultimate disintegration of
                                the Soviet bloc. Inevitably Czechoslovakia would gradually be forced
                                or be drawn to the other side of the Iron Curtain, especially if the
                                Czechs are to solve their economic problems without massive economic
                                aid from the Soviet Union. Thus the best the Soviets could hope for
                                unless present trends are arrested would be a Czechoslovakia paying
                                only lip service to the Warsaw Pact. Should the Poles or East
                                Germans catch the infection, the entire Soviet position in Europe
                                would be jeopardized. Furthermore, and there is no doubt in my mind
                                that this is a primary consideration of the leadership, this
                                infection would spread to the USSR and aggravate the problems of the
                                present order. There are already numerous signs of the disaffection
                                of intellectuals and youth, a widespread dissatisfaction with the
                                role of the Communist Party in this country, as well as a rising
                                feeling of nationalism in the various Soviet republics.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>Conclusion: In view of the foregoing, it is my view that the
                                Soviets will go to great lengths to push the Czechs back to
                                something close to the pre-January situation. A factor difficult to
                                judge in all this is the capability of the Soviet leadership to
                                unite in support of a bold and risky policy. Their tendency has been
                                to postpone, compromise or muddle through. Another is the ability of
                                the Czech leadership to remain united and correctly judge how much
                                they can get away with. I must confess that in the short run I am
                                pessimistic that the two sides can find and maintain the right
                                combination which will reconcile their conflicting needs and
                                objectives. In the longer view, it seems to me that however the
                                current crisis is dealt with the Soviets will be unable, even by
                                temporizing, to maintain a system that is out of step with the
                                times.</item>

                            <item>For the near future the levers in Soviet hands are not
                                insignificant. They can continue the war of nerves with military
                                threats and political pressure. They can play on Czechoslovak
                                differences and exploit those elements in Czech society opposed to
                                current trends. In view of heavy dependence of Czechoslovakia on the
                                bloc, and particularly the Soviet Union, for raw material as well as
                                markets, they can bring strong economic pressure. Although the
                                effect of their recent tactics has been both to consolidate Dubcek's

                                levers as fully as possible to try to avoid a situation where their
                                options are reduced to either direct military action or tacit

                                closely to Soviet foreign policy line. They also agreed at Cierna to

                            <item>Communiqué will be difficult for us to handle publicly since we

                                >Helms</persName>: Czechoslovakia is eased, not over. The Czechs
                            want to reduce commitment to Warsaw Pact. Czechoslovakia made certain
                            assurances. Prague meeting will take place in September. Soviets seek to
                            bring about reforms.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: Is it your opinion that the Soviets can't let this happen?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: The problem is if
                            both sides can move along so Czechoslovakia can progress and the Soviets
                            can take care of its problems with its students, visitors.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: Will pressure be kept on?</p>
                        <p>

                                >Helms</persName>: Yes. The situation will continue to be a tense
                            one.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: The best line publicly is that this is a sensitive situation. We
                            have sympathy but to say anything would not be helpful.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: That is right.</p>
                        <p>Governor Agnew: What is the relation of this to the Jewish question?</p>

                                >Helms</persName>: No anti-semitism in Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: The Czech government goes to great pains to show Jewish cemetery.
                            It is no problem. It is a problem in Poland.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Don't give the

                            <persName>Rostow</persName> commented that the Soviet decisions at
                            Cierna seemed wise to us, and potentially very important. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said these were matters of
                            great difficulty for his government. <persName>Rostow</persName> said we
                            understood that, and had tried, as the Secretary had made clear to him,
                            not to make the problem more complex. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that that was appreciated.
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> said we thought the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> proposals at Reykjavik were
                            constructive, and he hoped they were being carefully considered in this
                            connection. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked how
                            far those proposals went. <persName>Rostow</persName> said we had no
                            official position on that question, but remarked on a personal basis
                            that he thought they would find we were willing to examine any issue
                            they wished to raise in the field of balanced and mutual force
                            reduction, arms limitation, and European security, in the interest of
                            reducing tensions and promoting détente.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The President started off the meeting by asking Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> how he had been and asked
                            about Mr. <persName>Kosygin</persName>. He then told him that he had
                            night before last seen a color movie at the ranch which was very good.
                            The movie was one taken at Glassboro when the President met with
                            Kosygin.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he would
                            have liked to have seen it and the President told him that it was good
                            of both Kosygin and of him. The President said it was particularly good
                            when he was talking to the crowd which had assembled outside the
                            house.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said it was probably
                            the students.</p>
                        <p>The President said: “And you could have thought he was a … “ Mr.
                                <persName>Rostow</persName> spoke up and said “A campaigner.”</p>
                        <p>The President said: “Well, you would have thought he could be a County
                            Judge of New Jersey, or President of the United States or anybody.” Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> laughed at this
                            statement by the President. The President said it was colorful because
                            the children were in red, blue, and green—different colors. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked the President
                            if he had ever seen a Youth Parade (he was not sure what the name was)
                            and he said it was a pageant and very colorful and a huge gathering. He
                            said it was an interesting thing to see.</p>
                        <p>The President told <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>
                            that <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName> was going to be on
                            television at 9 o'clock and that he ought to watch it.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had just been down to have his hair cut because he
                            did not have a barber at the ranch, to which Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said “Why not?” They both
                            laughed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked
                            the President if he would be at the ranch long. The President had told
                            him he was leaving in the morning for the ranch. He said he would be
                            there unless President Eisenhower died. He said he would have to be
                            there the second day and possibly the third—it's a six day affair. He
                            said on the fifth day, however, they would take him out to Kansas and
                            the President said he did not know whether he would go out there or not.
                            The President said that President Eisenhower had had another attack that
                            day.</p>
                        <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0265"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said: “He still has a
                            strong heart because so many heart attacks, and he still survives. It's
                            unbelievable.”</p>
                        <p>The President told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            that he (the President) had had one heart attack and he almost did not
                            make it. He said his blood pressure went to zero at once and they
                            counted him out. He said they just thought he was gone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said: “This is very
                            dangerous … in the old country they used to give some stimulant or
                            something. Otherwise they couldn't do anything. There was no surgery,
                            anything specific. They couldn't do it—especially not at his age. And
                            today, even in my own country, now we have very nice surgeons—but …
                            until now there wasn't a single operation.”</p>
                        <p>The President said this was going to open up all new, different and
                            complex problems.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said: “This is the
                            point.”</p>
                        <p>The President then offered Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> a Fresca and asked him if he had ever drunk
                            this drink. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said:
                            “No, is it a strong one?”</p>
                        <p>The President told him that it contained no alcohol and had no calories
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> wanted to know
                            how he did it. The President said he had to lose some weight and that he
                            had lost about seven or eight pounds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said:</p>
                        <p>“Now, Mr. President, I have an urgent instruction from my government to
                            tell you about serious business. I will read it.”</p>
                        <p>The President asked him to read a little louder—that he was a little hard
                            of hearing but was so vain he would not wear a hearing aid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> went on to say:</p>
                        <p>”Kosygin asked me personally to visit you and to say the following on
                            behalf of my government. I will read this; what I am instructed to
                            say:</p>
                        <p>'The Government of the Soviet Union considers it necessary to inform,
                            personally, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                            about the following. In connection with the further aggravation of the
                            situation which was created by a conspiracy of the external and internal
                            forces of aggression against the existing social order in Czechoslovakia
                            and against the statehood established by the constitution of that
                            government, the government of Czechoslovakia Socialist Republic
                            approached the allied states, the Soviet Union among them, with a
                            request of rendering direct assistance, including the assistance of
                            military forces.</p>
                        <p>'The Soviet Government repeatedly stated that the events in
                            Czechoslovakia and around it involve vital interests of the Soviet Union
                            and of a number of other states tied by appropriate treaty obligations,
                            and that the threat to the Socialist order in Czechoslovakia constitutes
                            at the same time a threat to the foundations of European peace and world
                            security. In <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0266"/>view of this, the
                            Soviet Government and the Governments of the allied countries have taken
                            a joint decision to satisfy the request of the Government of the
                            Czechoslovak Socialist Republic rendering necessary assistance to the
                            Czechoslovak people. Accordingly, the Soviet military units received
                            orders to enter the territory of Czechoslovakia. Of course, they will be
                            withdrawn without delay from the territory of Czechoslovak Socialist
                            Republic as soon as the present threat to the security is eliminated and
                            they come to the conclusion that there is no need in further presence of
                            the allied forces. We would like President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                                >Johnson</persName> to know that our steps, which are being taken

                            the concern to strengthen peace and in no degree do they involve state
                            interests of the United States or any other state. We proceed from the
                            fact that the current events should not harm the Soviet-American
                            relations to the development of which the Soviet Government as before
                            attaches great importance.' This is what I was asked to tell you.”</p>

                                    decision at the request of the Government of Czechoslovakia to
                                    introduce military forces into Czechoslovakia because of a
                                    threat defined by the Czech Government; that those forces will
                                    remain until the threat to the Czech Government has passed, and
                                    be withdrawn. It is the hope of the Soviet Government that this
                                    will not interfere with US-Soviet relations and that there is no
                                    threat to the United States or to the interests of peace in
                                    Europe. In fact, it is stated that these moves should stabilize

                                    received that—I think your expression of it when I got off the
                                    airplane last night in Detroit—it said that it is acceptable, or
                                    there is no objection in Moscow if the American side desires
                                    it—if the American side desires it—and announce in the nearest

                                    when does the United States, or the President of the United
                                    States, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, wish

                                <p>The President said “what we propose is to announce at 10:00
                                    o'clock our time and whatever time it is there—6:00 o'clock
                                    their time. Look, while we're at it, I would like to touch a
                                    base or two, you see. And in order to touch a base, I have to
                                    get people to come in 35 miles to Washington. And I thought I'd
                                    do it at the breakfast table, and over breakfast I would say:
                                    This is what is going to be said when we finish the
                                    breakfast.”</p>

                                    issues that the Presidium would have to set. “The President's
                                    suggestion was, raised the question—would things move quicker if
                                    we accepted your language. But my guess is you have two issues
                                    that have to go to higher authority: One, the exact time of the
                                    announcement, and two, the exact language. So that any
                                    check-back, there had to be a check-back with Moscow on the
                                    time, Mr. President.”</p>

                            all were in there drunk. The President went on to say that Mr.

                            someone would say he is drunk again. They all laughed and <pb n="241"

                        <p>The President continued:</p>
                        <p>“The old Capitol that was built was the original Capitol that was
                            destroyed when we were a Republic. You see we were a Republic, an
                            Independent State, before we came in to the Union in 1845. We won our
                            independence in 1856 from Mexico, and from 1836 until 1845, a nine year
                            period, we were an independent Republic.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked why it called

                        <p>The President pointed out that that's the flag—that we had a lone star
                            flag and that we were known as the Lone Star State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said: “Did you know

                        <p>The President said:</p>
                        <p>“Yes, that was during the Civil War. One of the better Commanders, the
                            Hood Brigade. My grandfather was a member of it, and they went into
                            battle with the flag flying and the boys singing the Yellow Rose of
                            Texas. It's a good marching hymn. It gets you excited, and so on and so

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked if we had an
                            official state song or flower. The President replied that we have the
                            bluebonnet as our state flower but he did not know what our state song
                            was. Mr. <persName>Rostow</persName> laughingly said that if the
                            President didn't know, he certainly didn't.</p>

                            if it was his impression that this meeting be around the first of the

                        <p>The President then switched to a more serious note and said there were
                            many subjects that needed to be discussed and that he thought they were
                            very free to do that now and that he thought their meeting in Glassboro
                            was good. He said he enjoyed it very much. He thought it was good for
                            our people and for their people also.</p>
                        <p>He went on to say:</p>
                        <p>“I thought the reception they gave Mr. <persName>Kosygin</persName> was
                            really unusual. Ten years ago you wouldn't have thought that could
                            happen.” “I was here ten years ago” <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said, “so I know how the situation was.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> went on to say:</p>
                        <p>“For him it was a caution he had no chance to see more than New York and
                            New Jersey. He is very connected with the university. He would like to
                            see for himself, because he is the head of the whole economy of the
                            Soviet Union … All the responsibility of dealing with those buildings,
                            dams, those huge dams, factories … He said—in New York I would like to
                            see both bad and good sides.”</p>
                        <p>The President said—“We have many misfortunes and lots have problems, but
                            one of the fortunate things that's happened to both countries is that we
                            have been blessed with good men like <persName corresp="#p_TLE1"
                                >Thompson</persName> in Moscow who tells us what it is without
                            prejudice or without any hatred or without any ambition or personal
                            attempt to satisfy me or our Government. I want you to do the same thing
                            with your people. It would be good for this country and for your country
                            too, if we had men of quality like you and <persName corresp="#p_TLE1"
                                >Thompson</persName>.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> thanked the President
                            very much.</p>
                        <p>The President went on to say: “Yes, one Ambassador sometimes can change
                            the fate of the world. And a lot of times <persName>Tommy
                                Thompson</persName> says to me—well, just a minute.”</p>
                        <p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            to let us know about the other thing because he wanted to have the
                            breakfast date.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said: “Thank you very
                            much, and good luck.”</p>

                        <p>The President: I asked you to come here because of the alarm of the last
                            few hours. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            called me late today with a very “urgent” message. He read from a
                            long-hand note. (Insert A)<note n="2" xml:id="d81fn2">A copy of the
                                Soviet note is ibid. For text of the note, see <ref target="#d80"

                        <p>I told him we would give it our attention. He said they were invading
                            Czechoslovakia because the Czechs had asked them to come in.</p>
                        <p>I notified the Secretary of State and called this <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> meeting to analyze these actions and try to determine
                            what our national interest is.</p>
                        <p>It is one country invading another Communist country. It is aggression.
                            There is danger in aggression anywhere.</p>
                        <p>We need to give immediate thought to timing of meeting with Soviets. The
                            agenda is more full now than before. We must discuss all problems before
                            us. Is October agreeable or should we meet earlier.</p>
                        <p>There are serious questions: (1) Can we talk now after this. (2) Does our
                            presence look as though we condone this movement.</p>
                        <p>It demonstrates the difficulty the platform committee has in working out
                            strategy at the Hilton Hotel. What do we do?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: First, I am
                            surprised by the timing of this action. I am disappointed, particularly
                            in light of their favorable messages on (1) nuclear explosion (2)
                            strategic missile talks (3) your meeting.<note n="3" xml:id="d81fn3">The

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We do not know yet
                            if the Czechs will raise a voice. There is not a great deal we can do if
                            they don't. We could support the Czechs in the United Nations and
                            through <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>. If we do they can put
                            pressure on the West, particularly Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> called Berlin the testicles of the West and
                            when he wanted to create pressure he squeezed there.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>We have a public problem as well. We must decide what moral force and
                            political force we should bring to bear. The big question is what the
                            Czech reaction will be. I would not move ahead in next day or so.</p>
                        <p>The President: We should talk to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> tonight.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: For the press to
                            know I call him in to give him our views it will be good to position
                            ourselves publicly.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: There are two points
                            in <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s statement.</p>
                        <p>The President: I am amazed that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> told me it was at the request of the Czech
                            government and the Czech government was never told.</p>
                        <p>We must talk to him about the other announcement.</p>
                        <p>The President: We reviewed information and information given by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0272"/>
                        <p>The President instructed <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to
                            ask <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> in to discuss this
                            matter. The Secretary could say: <list>
                                <label>(a)</label>
                                <item>Astonished at this news.</item>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: They had first
                            meeting. It seemed to go well. They had a meeting of the Warsaw Pact
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>I am not clear as to the reason the Soviets took this action.</p>
                        <p>The President: We have been fearful that they lost so much face they had
                            to return. They could not stand to move in until the other ducks were in
                            a row.</p>
                        <p>

                                >Helms</persName>: It is not what has happened but what has not
                            happened. They wanted to see if the Czechs would clamp down on the

                            is just one piece on the chessboard. This march will have effects on
                            Poland, Bulgaria, Rumania and Hungary. We must visualize what effect
                            this will have on other countries.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: I agree we have
                            to speak to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. We have to
                            delay this announcement.</p>
                        <p>The President: This seems strange in light of (a) peaceful uses of atomic
                            energy and (b) the scheduled Geneva meeting. (c) The scheduled Geneva
                            announcement. Then this bombshell.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: It may be that
                            Supreme Soviet rumblings caused this.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: They have been
                            concerned about the internal structure of the Warsaw Pact and about not
                            destroying the relationship with the United States.</p>
                        <p>This occurred just before the Democratic convention, just as Hungarian
                            invasion occurred before election.</p>
                        <p>We can't be idle in the United Nations about this.</p>
                        <p>General Wheeler: There is no military action we can take. We do not have
                            the forces to do it.</p>
                        <p>This approach is cynical to the Nth degree. They have had CPX exercise
                            and troops on the border. I think this message is an insult to the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>They say keep your hands off.</p>

                        <p>Dean (Secretary Rusk) should say the future course of US-USSR relations
                            depends on how this is handled.</p>
                        <p>The President: A. Do we send for him? B. Do we say no announcement? C. Do
                            we say we are utterly dismayed by it. D. Cannot reconcile his statement
                            with other statements we've received.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Czechoslovakia is
                            3rd arms supplier to Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>General Wheeler: That is because they were told to.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: Bus<note n="6"

                            matter. They may be sincerely conciliatory. Suppose there is no combat.
                            Suppose there is a pullout. They had a lot of troops in there two weeks
                            ago.</p>
                        <p>The President: I sympathize with General Wheeler's views. We do not have
                            to say what we feel. 1. Call in <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>. 2. Tell him we won't make announcement. 3.
                            Tell him we asked Council to meet.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President: We need to show caution. The Czechs touched the heart
                            of the Communist revolution. All you can do is snort and talk.</p>

                                here by surprise. Some had expected it in earlier stage of crisis.
                                None with whom we have talked thought it particularly likely
                                following Bratislava Declaration, which seemed offer a face-saving

                            <item>There is consequently considerable speculation that Soviet
                                leadership itself shifted from a minority to a majority favoring
                                invasion in interval following Bratislava meeting. Story was current
                                this evening among diplomats that as late as August 19 Kosygin and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Podgorny</persName> (sic), summoned
                                hastily from vacation, were confronted with new majority decision in
                                Politburo for intervention. This story is not confirmed, and all
                                reports of Politburo views and actions must be considered suspect in
                                absence firm intelligence. Their relevance to what has happened will

                            <item>Alternative hypothesis is that decision to intervene was taken at
                                or immediately following Bratislava meeting. According this
                                hypothesis, Bratislava Declaration was from outset purely tactical
                                compromise papering over differences so fundamental that Soviets
                                recognized they were unbridgeable under <persName corresp="#p_DA1"
                                    >Dubcek</persName> leadership. Invasion was consequently timed
                                to achieve maximum psychological and tactical surprise (which was in

                            <item>What seems readily estimable, on basis our conversations this
                                evening, is that many countries under emotional impact of events
                                find Soviet action so repugnant that their bilateral relations are
                                likely to suffer at all levels; that November international
                                conference of Communist Parties faces virtually insuperable odds;
                                that underdeveloped third world countries will have second thoughts
                                as to Soviet connections; and that East-West détente has suffered
                                significant setback.</item>

                                that regime has resorted to military force against ally accused of
                                ideological deviation cannot but add [garble] to already strident
                                demands on Soviet population for orthodoxy and conformity. We
                                anticipate that in near term Soviet population will conform. Over
                                longer term, consequences for leadership are unpredictable. Some
                                heads could fall unless there was greater support for intervention
                                than most diplomats believe possible.</item>

                                For the short term, however, it seems to us indispensable that we
                                condemn invasion in strongest terms and avoid any action which could
                                be construed as mitigating that condemnation. That applies not only
                                to Soviet Union but to its four collaborators.</item>

                        <p>A decision was made on Monday. If there were military intervention, there
                            would be a world war.</p>
                        <p>In the Security Council the matter was inscribed, 13–2. India, Pakistan
                            and Algeria voted to put it on the agenda. Only two voted against it.
                            They were the Soviet Union and Hungary.</p>
                        <p>There would be 80–90 votes on this issue in the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>This action has created violent world reaction.</p>
                        <p>The National Assembly can speak. The President and the Foreign Minister

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Helms</persName> reported to the group
                            that Rumanians were in a state of considerable apprehension because they
                            were afraid that if Russia moved on Czechoslovakia, they would also have
                            to move at the same time on Rumania. That explained the mobilization of
                            Rumanian forces. He pointed out that Rumania had taken one of the
                            strongest public positions on Czechoslovakia of any government in the
                            world. He said we believe it is important to make clear that this is not
                            just a bilateral issue between the Soviet Union and the United States,
                            but it is a case of the Soviet Union against all the rest.</p>
                        <p>General Wheeler said that <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName>
                            met with about sixty of his editors but apparently was unable to
                            dissuade them to show their strength that would satisfy the Soviets. He
                            said that while there would be no evidence, it was reasonable to
                            speculate that there had been a shift between the Soviet politburo at
                            that time in favor of intervention. He said you can sum it up what the
                            Soviets' objectives were and are if you set the clock back. What it
                            really amounts to is their concern about their own position, their own
                            power. They already had lost Yugoslavia and Rumania has been going
                            completely independent in foreign policy. But the thing that was
                            particularly of concern to them in Czechoslovakia was the introduction
                            of democracy into the Czech Communist Party and freedom of the press
                            which General Wheeler thought was completely incompatible with the
                            Communist system.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that they had
                            not contemplated military action in support of Czechoslovakia in this
                            situation—nor had Czechoslovakia asked for it or suggested it. In that
                            situation, therefore, the most powerful weapon with the Soviet Union
                            would seem to be unanimous—highly mobilized charged world reaction
                            against this kind of thing. So in the very nature of their system, the
                            Soviet Union pays special attention to propaganda aspects.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> took the matter up
                            with the United Nations and he reported on his meetings with
                            representatives of the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> said that from
                            the military standpoint the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviets
                            has been a very well planned, efficient, <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251"
                                facs="0279"/>and sophisticated operation. They moved a great many
                            planes and enormous number of men. They did it very efficiently.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> further stated that we
                            must view it within the framework of the attention that the Defense
                            Department and this Government has been giving to the Soviet Union in
                            the past month for it's very clear that the Soviet Union is heading down
                            the road to greater military strength. He said the matter reached a
                            point of drama last October when at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet,
                            the present regime announced that they were going to increase military
                            expenditures for 1968 by 15 percent. Coupled with that was an
                            announcement by the Soviets that they would increase outlays for science
                            by 11 percent. We have come to know that that area carries a very heavy
                            leading [<hi rend="italic">loading</hi>?] of military expenditures. When
                            these announcements were made, they indicated there would have to be
                            cutbacks in the investment for agriculture and in non-military
                            commodities. It appears clear now that the Soviet leaders with this
                            increased military strength intend to find ways to increase that
                            additional military power into political influence.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> went on to say that the
                            Soviets appear to be engaged in a process of letting the world know that
                            the Soviet Union can deliver its forces wherever it might choose to
                            deliver them—say through the Mediterranean and throughout the European
                            area. They have been engaged in a rather expensive ship-building program
                            and even more dangerous to our own security is an exceedingly extensive
                            and very sophisticated submarine-building program. He said that for
                            those who have a degree of responsibility in this field to visualize the
                            Czechoslovakian incident within a framework of a basic program wherein
                            the Soviet Union is substantially increasing its military strength.</p>
                        <p>The President then called on General Wheeler for his remarks. General
                            Wheeler said that from the military point of view, the Soviet
                            intervention in Czechoslovakia was quick, efficient, and effective. It
                            was based upon very thorough planning. He reported they had command post
                            exercise during a period from August 13–20 in which they went through
                            all the necessary planning and practicing in the time and space factors
                            to do precisely what they did. During the period of six to ten days
                            Soviet divisions moved to the Czechoslovakia border. Three came from
                            East Germany, one from Poland and two from the Carpathian military
                            district of the USSR. On the 30th of June they held a Warsaw Pact
                            exercise in Czechoslovakia and they had elements of four divisions that
                            had actually moved into Czechoslovakia and the Czechs at least to some
                            degree participated in the exercise. They also had similar exercises in
                            Poland and East Germany. Later they moved more divisions up, having
                            between 19 and 24 Warsaw Pact divisions. This would be somewhere between
                            190,000 and 250,000 men. Their actual intervention followed rather
                            precisely the pattern of those command post exercises.</p>
                        <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0280"/>
                        <p>General Wheeler pointed out that there are military disadvantages also as
                            far as the Soviets are concerned. They had a sizeable number of units in
                            Czechoslovakia—far more than they really needed to deal with the Czechs.
                            But if fighting did break out there they would have losses and so on
                            which would decrease their capability to engage in any other military
                            adventure and that the Warsaw Pact had been weakened in a broad sense by
                            the actual loss of the Czech armed forces to their cause and he would
                            judge they would have little reliance in the remaining Armed forces
                            under the present circumstances. He made the observation that the
                            situation in Central Europe today indicates it would be less than
                            prudent for us to further reduce the U.S. military presence there. On
                            the other hand, he suggested that we should take the lead in maintaining
                            our strength, improving it to the degree we can, and in urging our
                            allies to improve their forces in certain areas where improvement is
                            certainly needed.</p>

                        <p>After careful review, we have concluded that our present course of
                            mobilizing world opinion through the United Nations offers the best hope
                            at this time of influencing the Soviets toward moderation in the present

                                <item>The Soviets might even gain a propaganda advantage since they
                                    have sought to conjure up a <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                                <item>Most of the allies favor the UN approach, and some at least
                                    would be most reluctant to participate in a <gloss

                        </p>
                        <p>Similar reasons militate against a Tripartite (US, <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>, France) or Quadripartite Heads of Government meeting at
                            this time. The French Foreign Minister told Ambassador Shriver on August
                            21 of his opposition to “formal consultations” between the US, the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France, since these could only
                            result in a “meaningless declaration” which would be useless. There are
                            even more cogent reasons why a top-level meeting including the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would be inadvisable at this time.
                            These include the fact that, historically, the Germans are viewed by
                            many of the Eastern Europeans, including the Czechs, with suspicion.</p>
                        <p>We consider it important, nevertheless, that while the public spotlight
                            remains focused on New York, the US take action with the allies to
                            demonstrate its leadership in regard to the Czech crisis. We think the
                            best approach would be for the President to send personal messages to
                            Heads of Government of all other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries. We shall be submitting a recommended text for such messages
                            covering a number of points in our current position on the crisis. Such
                            messages would also emphasize the importance of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                        <p>The Secretary said he had asked the Ambassador to come in for a very
                            informal chat about current problems. He began by referring to his talk
                            with the Ambassador early in the week on developments in
                                Czechoslovakia.<note n="2" xml:id="d87fn2">See <ref target="#d82"
                                    >Document 82</ref>.</note> The Secretary said that he came from
                            Georgia and was sometimes referred to as soft spoken in manner. He
                            wondered whether the Ambassador had in any way been misled by the manner
                            in which he had discussed the Czechoslovakia problem, and whether the
                            Ambassador had fully understood the significance of what the Secretary
                            had told him about reaction in this country and the possible effect of
                            Czechoslovakia developments on Soviet-American relations.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he had fully understood the Secretary's remarks. He
                            said that the decision which his Government had made was obviously not
                            an easy one. The reaction in the United States and for that matter in
                            certain Communist parties had been clearly predictable. He had
                            personally thought that a solution to the Czech problem had been found,
                            but something must have happened to change the situation. In speculating
                            on what this might be the Secretary referred to Herr <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s visit to Czechoslovakia.<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d87fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> met with <persName

                                Czechoslovakia, on August 12.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that Soviet policy
                            was not determined by Herr <persName corresp="#p_UW1"
                                >Ulbricht</persName> or anyone else. East Germany was of course an
                            important member of the Warsaw Pact, but the Soviets knew how to say no
                            to Herr Ulbricht. Later in the conversation Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> speculated on the role of the
                            Czechoslovakia press in effecting the Soviet reaction, and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> acknowledged that
                            this was certainly a factor. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that his counselor had returned from
                            Moscow last weekend, and had told him that most of the Soviet leaders
                            were on vacation. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had
                            been on the verge of asking permission to accompany his wife and
                            daughter when they return to the Soviet Union next Tuesday. He indicated
                            he had received <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0283"/>word of the
                            change in Soviet policy only a short time before he had informed the
                            President about it.</p>
                        <p>When the Secretary indicated that he had been surprised by the Soviet
                            action, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> attempted to
                            justify it largely on the basis of internal developments in
                            Czechoslovakia. The Secretary said that we had seen no indications that
                            Czechoslovakia intended to leave the Warsaw Pact or conduct itself in
                            any way other than as a member of the socialist camp. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that in his view it had
                            become clear that <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName> was a
                            weak leader who was allowing things to drift, and that in these
                            circumstances the right was steadily gaining influence, and the Soviets
                            thought that <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName> was losing
                            control of the situation. These developments were leading in the
                            direction of a situation in which Czechoslovakia would no longer be a
                            member of the Warsaw Pact. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> emphasized that the Czech economic reforms had
                            nothing to do with the case as the Soviets considered that this was a
                            matter for them alone to decide.</p>
                        <p>When the Secretary again referred to the possible effect of recent
                            developments on Soviet-American relations, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that he could tell the Secretary that he
                            had received instructions to say, in case the subject were raised, that
                            the Soviet Union desired to continue to make progress upon the bilateral
                            questions with which they had been dealing before the recent Czech
                            events. He referred specifically to the peaceful uses of atomic energy
                            and the strategic missile problem. He understood that it would probably
                            be impossible for the United States to proceed immediately in these
                            matters while the international situation was still so unclear. Without
                            wishing to press the Secretary he wondered whether as a matter of
                            policy, unrelated to timing, the United States would also wish to
                            proceed to deal with these problems.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that his reply would have to consist of two
                            statements. The first was that from the beginning of his administration
                            the President was profoundly and passionately interested in advancing
                            the cause of peace and in promoting better relations and better
                            understanding between our two countries. We of course had differences,
                            and some of these would remain but in this atomic age the President
                            considered it essential to do everything he could to diminish dangers of
                            conflict. The Secretary mentioned that the President had today met with
                            the Congressional leadership. Many of these men had been scattered about
                            the country, and their reactions reflected the serious impression which
                            the Czech developments had had on the American people. It appeared that
                            the President would be subject to strong criticism for his efforts in
                            building better relations with the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, he could
                            assure the Ambassador of the President's deep commitment to the cause of
                            peace.</p>
                        <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0284"/>
                        <p>The second part of his answer was that at the present stage he simply
                            could not say what the policy of the United States would be upon the
                            problems under discussion with the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed the hope that President Svoboda's visit to Moscow
                            would be successful.<note n="4" xml:id="d87fn4"> Svoboda visited Moscow

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that Svoboda would
                            stay on until the next day when he would return to Czechoslovakia. The
                            Secretary raised the question of the safety of the Czech leaders,<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d87fn5">
                                <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName>, Prime Minister Cernik,
                                and three other Czech leaders were seized and flown to Moscow during
                                the invasion.</note> and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that while of course he had no specific
                            information, he was convinced that no harm would come to <persName
                                corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName> or the other Czech personalities.
                            In this connection the Secretary referred to the Czech radio broadcast
                            commenting on the composition of the Czech delegation that had gone to
                            Moscow.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned that the President had gone to the Ranch. We had
                            received in the last few hours a number of alarming rumors about a
                            possible Soviet invasion of Romania. The Secretary emphasized that these
                            rumors had not come to us from the Romanians. The Ambassador would
                            surely be aware of what the effect such action would have upon the
                            United States opinion coming on top of the recent Soviet action in
                            Czechoslovakia. The Secretary expected the President to telephone him as
                            soon as he arrived at the Ranch and received these reports, and the
                            Secretary did not know what he should reply. He asked whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had any information on this
                            subject. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had
                            neither seen nor heard any indication whatever of any contemplated
                            Soviet action against Romania, and did not believe that there was
                            anything to these rumors. On the contrary, he referred to the warm
                            greetings which the Soviet leadership had sent to the Romanian leaders
                            on the occasion of their National holiday.<note n="6" xml:id="d87fn6"

                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded the conversation by stating that he did not
                            contemplate informing the press of Ambassador <persName

                        <p>The Secretary referred to the statement Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had made to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> when informing him of
                            Soviet action in Czechoslovakia to the effect that nothing was
                            contemplated which would affect the vital interest of the United States.
                            The Secretary said we had noted this statement very carefully and
                            assumed that it was meant to be taken quite seriously. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> confirmed that this
                            was indeed the case.</p>
                        <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0285"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> how long he thought
                            the jamming of our broadcasts would go on. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said he thought the jamming quite probably was
                            related to the debates in the Security Council and mentioned that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had used some
                            very strong language.</p>
                        <p>In discussing the Soviet action in Czechoslovakia, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the Soviet troops had
                            obviously had strict orders not to respond to provocations until
                            absolutely necessary. He mentioned one incident in which some Czechs had
                            deliberately crashed an automobile into a Soviet tank and then had taken
                            pictures of it.</p>

                                taken over key points they have not established martial law (except
                                in some provincial cities), have not imposed military government,
                                and have not yet installed puppet government. Legally constituted
                                government claims to be still in being: 22 out of about 30 Ministers
                                attended Cabinet meeting yesterday, apparently in Hradcany Castle.
                                National Assembly claims to be in continuing session in its own

                                of occupation has been demonstrated in unmistakable and in some
                                cases ingenious ways. Downtown area was almost completely plastered
                                with placards yesterday (many have disappeared this morning, either
                                as result of rain or clean-up by Soviets during curfew). Last night
                                we saw new neon sign in bright light district which read simply
                                    ”<persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName>.” On advice radio
                                stations which anticipating [garble] street signs and house numbers
                                have completely disappeared in some districts of city. Actions of
                                population and slogans (including many which equate Soviets with
                                Fascists) are highly provocative, but with few exceptions people
                                have been able to avoid provoking extreme reaction by occupiers.
                                Widespread calls for neutrality represents wishful thinking which
                                could embarrass reformist leaders seeking realistic solution.
                                Cancellation of mass demonstration late Thursday afternoon with
                                enforcement by young Czechs is best example of self-discipline
                                practiced by population. Silent clearing of streets during general

                                are in circulation, probably because of gasoline unavailability (gas
                                stations no longer operating). Most shops remained closed through
                                yesterday but are beginning to open this morning. Prague factories
                                were open yesterday but did not seem to be working. Food still
                                available in limited supplies, for which long queues wait, but we
                                have seen little evidence of obvious hoarding.</item>

                        <p>I had lunch today with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> pursuant to an invitation which he had issued
                            last Friday. In the course of the conversation, I said I was still
                            baffled by what had triggered the Soviet decision to invade. He said he
                            was also curious but doubted if he would find out until the next time he
                            was in Moscow. I said that it was clear that there had been a Politburo
                            meeting on the weekend but there was some doubt <pb n="260"
                                xml:id="pg_260" facs="0288"/>as to whether there had actually been a
                            meeting of the Central Committee. He replied that it was quite clear
                            that it had been and that a decision of this sort would require such a
                            meeting. I said that I assumed that some of the members would not have
                            been able to get there on time, and he replied that obviously the people
                            on the other side of the country had been unable to be present.</p>
                        <p>When I remarked that I thought that their military had carried out their
                            side of the operation more effectively than the political side, he said,
                            “You better not say that around Moscow.”</p>
                        <p>When I inquired how he would interpret the word, “temporarily,” with
                            respect to the length of stay of the Soviet troops, he replied that he
                            thought this would depend entirely upon how successful the Czechs were
                            in carrying out the agreement. The Soviets would obviously like to make
                            this period as short as possible.</p>
                        <p>He stated that he thought the basic problem was the Soviet concern that
                            the Communist party was losing control and mentioned in passing the type
                            of thing that was appearing in the Czech press as well as the activities
                            of non-Communist party groups. I said that speaking frankly and
                            personally there seemed to have been a serious misjudgment of the
                            situation. He referred to the fact that the Soviets under Stalin had
                            suffered much more than the Czechs ever had from the cult of personality
                            but that the recent outcry in Czechoslovakia had been quite different
                            from the reaction in the Soviet Union after the denunciation of Stalin.
                            The Czechs were beginning to blame everything that had happened on the
                            Communist party and to say that there had been nothing good
                            accomplished.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that there was an element of nationalism involved in the
                            case of Czechoslovakia that was absent in the case of the Soviet Union.
                            He admitted that this was true.</p>

                            reports in regard to Romania.<note n="3" xml:id="d90fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d87">Document 87</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he had reported his conversation but had received no
                            reply.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we continue to get reports that were disturbing
                            and that in the last 24 hours we had received a number of reports of
                            troop movements, incidents on the frontier, etc. He asked whether the
                            Ambassador had any basis on which he could give him assurances that
                            action against Romania was not intended.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had no official
                            information but that he personally doubted that any such action was
                            contemplated.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that if such action were contemplated, he wished in
                            the name of all humanity to ask that it not be done. The results of such
                            action on world affairs would be incalculable.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> inquired if the
                            Romanians felt the same way.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we had no reports whatever from the Romanians. He
                            wished, however, to underline the gravity of this problem. We were <pb
                                n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0290"/>deeply concerned. Our attitude
                            was based upon well-known principles that had motivated us throughout
                            our history. Our attitude on Czechoslovakia was not related to our
                            bilateral relations with that country which were not particularly good.
                            We believed, however, that every country, large or small, had a right to
                            national existence. We respect that among our <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> allies and we thought the Soviets should respect it
                            among their Warsaw Pact allies. We cannot understand how the state
                            interests of the Soviet Union were involved in any way that would
                            justify military action. Czechoslovakia was not going to leave the
                            Warsaw Pact or join <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and no one was
                            threatening them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished again to underline the seriousness with
                            which we took the Ambassador's statement to the President on Aug. 20,
                            and repeated today, that the Soviet Union did not intend in any way to
                            threaten the state interests of the US. He wished to point out that
                            among these interests was Berlin. Frankly, we did not trust <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>. We wished to emphasize the
                            gravity of any move with respect to Berlin in the current situation. He
                            also wished to point out that the thoughts he had expressed carried the
                            authority of the President with whom he had just talked by
                                telephone.<note n="4" xml:id="d90fn4">No record of this telephone
                                conversation was found.</note> The Secretary said he would be
                            available any time, day or night, if the Ambassador had anything to say
                            to him.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked if he could report
                            that he had made his oral statement and that the Secretary would study
                            it and comment later.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed but said he could say now with respect to the
                            reference in the statement to revanchist and imperialist threats to
                            socialist countries that there was no such threat, no <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> plot, there was no intrusion into any
                            of these countries in a manner hostile to the Soviet Union. We could not
                            accept a statement that revanchists or imperialists were carrying out
                            any threat to any of these countries.</p>

                            the text.</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                        <p>In the spirit of our frank and friendly talks at Glassboro, I wish to
                            underline what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said
                            to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> last night
                            and what I said at San Antonio.</p>
                        <p>The concept we explored at Glassboro was one in which the United States
                            and the Soviet Union carefully avoided pressing against each other's
                            vital interests; avoided being drawn into conflict by others; worked
                            towards the maximum number of bilateral agreements judged by each nation
                            to be in its interest and the common interest; and constructed
                            agreements—bilateral or working with others—which would reduce the
                            possibilities of conflict and danger on the world scene.</p>
                        <p>Looking back over the year after Glassboro, I believe we had reason to
                            feel we were making some progress.</p>
                        <p>But the application of Soviet military power in Czechoslovakia and the
                            reports we are receiving of further military movements in Eastern Europe
                            are sources of deep disquiet. No evidence has come to me which suggests
                            that events in Czechoslovakia or elsewhere in Eastern Europe <pb n="264"
                                xml:id="pg_264" facs="0292"/>have in any way constituted a security
                            threat to the Soviet Union. On this matter, the policy of the United
                            States and of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies has,
                            moreover, been clear: We ourselves have no desire or intention of taking
                            any action in Eastern Europe which might threaten the security of the
                            Soviet Union. On the contrary, we have been working towards the
                            possibility that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw
                            Pact might negotiate mutual troop withdrawals or reductions and
                            gradually ameliorate the confrontation in Central Europe and open the
                            way towards stable peace in that critical area.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I deeply believe what I said last night: I see no issues that
                            we confront or that the Soviet Union confronts which cannot be better
                            settled by patient negotiation than by the application of military
                            power. I hold that view with respect to Southeast Asia and the Middle
                            East as well as Europe.</p>
                        <p>It is against that background that I wish to tell you of the depth of the
                            concern felt in our government and by our people about events in Eastern
                            Europe. Twice in your lifetime and mine world war has come upon us,
                            triggered by events in Eastern Europe. In 1914 this happened without
                            anyone really intending it to happen. The forces that are set in motion
                            when military power is applied are sometimes extremely hard to control
                            and may lead humanity down paths which no man and no government
                            intends.</p>
                        <p>At this moment, therefore, I urge you and your colleagues to pause and
                            consider whether we might not turn back towards the path we explored at
                            Glassboro. What has already happened in Czechoslovakia has made this
                            more difficult. But I would hope that the Soviet Union and the other
                            nations which joined in bringing their forces into Czechoslovakia, will
                            promptly find it possible to withdraw them, as Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s oral message to me of August
                            20 indicated would happen.<note n="4" xml:id="d91fn4">See <ref

                            government would hold its hand, if it is the case that a military
                            movement is contemplated against Rumania or any other country in Eastern
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>I would also hope that there is no misunderstanding in Moscow or
                            elsewhere about our election processes and debates in the United States.
                            I know that sometimes they can convey to others a wrong impression of
                            division and distraction. But there is, I know, a deep and united
                            sentiment in the United States against the movement of arms and men
                            across international frontiers.</p>
                        <p>I send you this message because the peace of the world depends peculiarly
                            on the policies of the United States and the USSR. The facts of <pb

                            CRISIS</p>
                        <p rend="center">I. Introduction</p>
                        <p>The Czechoslovak crisis has raised grave issues for the United States and
                            its Western European allies. It has cast into question such matters as
                            the future of détente, the defensive capability of Western Europe, and
                            the future of Communism and the independent states of Eastern
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this paper is to examine the issues and the current and
                            prospective means for meeting these problems by the United States and
                            its allies.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II. Détente</p>
                        <p>The August 20–21 occupation of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact provided
                            a cold douche for the future of détente, or the progressive
                            rapprochement of East and West. In the late Sixties, the achievement of
                            détente had become an important objective in the policies of most
                            Western European nations as well as the United States. It had become a
                            key <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0294"/>element in the work program
                            of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But its assumed basis was
                            seriously undermined by the Czechoslovak crisis.</p>
                        <p>Most Western nations have reacted with strong expressions of disgust at,
                            and disapproval of, the Warsaw Pact occupation of independent
                            Czechoslovakia. There was almost universal support for the United
                            Nations consideration of this problem and approbation for the resolution
                            supported by the majority in the Security Council.<note n="2"

                        </p>
                        <p>To give further meaning to their disapproval, most Western nations
                            undertook to limit contacts with the Soviets and the occupying powers of
                            the Warsaw Pact, and cancelled plans or proposed visits in the political
                            and cultural fields. As the repression of Czechoslovakia continues, with
                            the possibility of the installation of a de facto occupation regime, the
                            deterioration of East-West contacts may well continue.</p>
                        <p>These relatively limited actions do not necessarily preclude the
                            possibility of return in due course to the pursuit of détente. The
                            present disposition of many European nations is to avoid actions which
                            might impair the eventual resumption of closer relations with the Soviet
                            Union and the countries of Eastern Europe. The positions of the United
                            Kingdom and the Government of France on this score are particularly
                            apparent.</p>
                        <p>US actions have so far generally paralleled those of its Western European
                            allies. For the time being we are seeking a balanced approach that will
                            satisfy the immediate objective of expressing censure of Soviet action
                            without destroying overnight our longer-range goals.</p>
                        <p>In the cultural field we propose the following criteria: <list>
                                <label>a.</label>
                                <item>Cancel or postpone highly visible exchanges susceptible to
                                    being interpreted as evidence of goodwill or friendship toward
                                    the invading powers. (For example, the trip of the Minnesota
                                    Band to Russia.)</item>
                                <label>b.</label>
                                <item>We do not propose disrupting low-visibility exchanges already
                                    in progress. (For example, graduate students, individual
                                    scientists and researchers already on study tours.) But we
                                    should discourage new initiatives.</item>
                                <label>c.</label>
                                <item>We should avoid across-the-board restrictive measures, such as
                                    indiscriminate restrictions on travel that could be construed as
                                    a return to the cold war.</item>
                                <label>d.</label>
                                <item>We should maintain exchange activities with Czechoslovakia to
                                    the extent possible, and with the still-independent state of
                                    Romania. In Czechoslovakia, for instance, we should participate
                                    in the Trade Fair at Brno if the Czechoslovak Government decides
                                    to hold it.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0295"/>
                        <p>In the political and economic fields similar criteria should prevail. We
                            are considering cancelling or discouraging activities such as the second
                            inaugural flight of Aeroflot.</p>
                        <p>We might continue certain scientific and technical activities which are
                            of special interest to us, such as oceanographic research and the
                            renegotiation of the US–USSR Atlantic Fisheries Agreement.</p>
                        <p>In the area of peace and security, important decisions will need to be
                            taken. For example, should we agree to open missile talks at any
                            definite early date. Similar decisions involve US participation in the
                            solar eclipse experimentation in the USSR, US–USSR discussions on
                            peaceful nuclear devices, etc.</p>
                        <p>In the economic area we should discourage the development of new
                            commercial activities with the aggressor states, and we are considering
                            a curtailment of export licenses.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III. The Defense of Western Europe</p>
                        <p>The movement of Warsaw Pact forces into Czechoslovakia and the continuing
                            occupation of that country has obviously affected the military situation
                            in Europe. The status quo has been changed. There are larger military
                            forces present in Central Europe than at any time since the post-war
                            period. The military occupation of Czechoslovakia puts Soviet forces in
                            a country where they have not been since World War II. There is no
                            assurance as yet that the Warsaw Pact forces will soon return to their
                            deployment where they existed six weeks ago.</p>
                        <p>The changed East-West military situation in Europe is of significance to
                            the security of the United States and its allies. In the light of these
                            developments we are reviewing with our allies what the implications may
                            be for existing arrangements to provide for our common security.</p>
                        <p>The principal forum for this review will be <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. Since the onset of the Czech crisis, the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> posture has combined three essential
                            elements: (a) vigilance by the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            political and military authorities; (b) a low public profile while the
                            spotlight was on the United Nations; and (c) intensified consultations
                            among the Allies regarding implications of the situation for Western
                            security interests.</p>
                        <p>As a result of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> consultations a
                            number of issues require consideration. These are outlined below.</p>

                            />British on August 30 took the initiative. They have sought our views
                            on two alternative proposals. Both take account of the fact that Defense
                            Ministers of seven <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries are
                            already scheduled to meet in Bonn, October 10–11, as the Nuclear
                            Planning Group (NPG).</p>
                        <p>The first alternative envisages postponing the NPG until the end of
                            October or early November, advancing the date of the usual year-end
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting to the end of October
                            or early November, and holding both sessions in Brussels. The result
                            would be a stock-taking meeting of Foreign and Defense Ministers to
                            consider defense and political matters arising from the crisis. Like the
                            normal December meeting, fourteen countries would meet to examine
                            defense issues while the French would join them later to examine
                            political problems. In the course of the three (or four) day session,
                            the seven-nation NPG would meet for a day.</p>
                        <p>The second alternative involves simply broadening the presently scheduled
                            (October) NPG meeting to include all Defense Ministers (except
                            presumably the French). The British favor the first alternative on
                            political, psychological and practical grounds. It would permit a
                            maximum amount of business to be transacted and avoid a “nuclear
                            affairs” meeting as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s first major
                            response to the Czech crisis.</p>
                        <p>A key question, in either case, is whether the necessary groundwork can
                            be laid in time to permit Ministers to take substantive decisions. A
                            meeting without concrete results could be disappointing for <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as an organization and for public
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>Another possible course would be to hold a special meeting of Foreign and
                            Defense Ministers towards the end of September to issue a new program of
                            work for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The usual year-end
                            meeting would be held in December. A September meeting would have the
                            advantage of an early public response by <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> to the crisis.</p>

                            the Allies intent to refrain from exercising the right of withdrawal for
                            an additional period of years (say, ten) beyond 1969. (Article 13
                            provides that, after the Treaty has been in force for twenty years, a
                            signatory state can withdraw on one year's notice.)</p>
                        <p>The Allied Governments could act on this problem either by amending the
                            Treaty or issuing individual declarations of intent to refrain from
                            exercising the withdrawal right for, say, ten more years.</p>
                        <p>Greater assurance about the Alliance's future would have favorable impact

                        <p>This subject may arise in preliminary fashion, at least in the corridors,

                                >NATO</gloss> review of the overall situation. This proposal gives

                        <p>Beyond this immediate question, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            must now reexamine its entire force posture and dispositions in Europe
                            in light of such factors as what the invasion of Czechoslovakia showed
                            about Soviet and Warsaw Pact operations and capabilities, and the fact
                            that Soviet forces will probably be stationed on Czechoslovakia's

                        <p>Apart from other US objectives that may emerge as a result of study, we

                            This could include improvement of reserves, equipment, and mobilization
                            capabilities as well as any changes in standing forces.</p>

                            fundamentally as a result of the Czech crisis. But certain aspects,
                            notably the doctrine of political warning time, will have to be
                            reexamined. The doctrine envisages that, prior to any overt Warsaw Pact

                        <p>On all of the foregoing subjects, the French are in a special position
                            for two reasons. First, they do not participate in most aspects of the
                            integrated military system. Second, since the invasion of
                            Czechoslovakia, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has
                            reaffirmed his policy of opposition to “blocs”. As a corollary, the
                            French have been negative on the idea of special high-level Western
                                meetings—<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>, or European Community.</p>
                        <p>In all probability, the French would, however, be represented at any

                            Fourteen to meet without them for part of the session to deal with
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military questions. The best
                            hope for improving French cooperation in Eastern defense would probably
                            be through practical steps—improved liaison with the <gloss

                            forces in Germany. The Germans are probably in the best position to

                        <p>The Federal Republic of Germany—on the Central Front with the largest
                            land army of the continental allies—has been particularly hard hit by
                            the Czechoslovak crisis. The actions of the Warsaw Pact aggressor states
                            have thrown into question the German policy of seeking better relations
                            with the countries of Eastern Europe. Moreover, the rapidity with which
                            the Soviet Union, with little apparent warning, undertook this action,
                            has shaken German confidence in the warning time principle of the <gloss

                        <p>The Soviet actions have also caused a reexamination of the German
                            attitude towards signature of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (<gloss

                            re-appraisal. The Germans feel that to sign the <gloss target="#t_NPT1"
                                >NPT</gloss>—with its duration—might well jeopardize their future

                        <p>The German press is heavy with charges of “super power complicity” in the
                            Czechoslovak crisis and expressions of uneasy doubts of the ability of
                            the US and other of Germany's allies to stand up to the Warsaw Pact. In
                            addition, there is the problem of Berlin. The actions of the Warsaw Pact
                            aggressor states, following upon the June actions of East Germany
                            against Berlin, raise doubts in German minds about the future of that
                            city which they regard as an important part of Free Germany.</p>
                        <p>The result is a general malaise through Germany. Kiesinger reacted to
                            this feeling in his recent interview when he urged a <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> summit meeting as a means of putting
                            new life in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Germany is key to the security of Europe and to the effective functioning
                            of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance. While the current
                            malaise may be founded on emotionalism rather than fact, it remains true
                            that Germany is uneasy and disturbed. Such an attitude can have a
                            multiplier effect throughout Europe unless steps are taken now to
                            reaffirm the solidity and efficacy of Western defense within <gloss

                        <p>In short, high-level review and reappraisal by <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> nations could well be an important ingredient in
                            calming the German attitude. It could also be an important factor in the

                        <p>The USSR has become increasingly isolated within the international
                            Communist movement and has undercut its position of leadership because
                            of its rigidity and inability to adjust to changing times. As things
                            stand, the “Communist family” has now been reduced to “The Five“: The
                            USSR, Poland, Hungary, East Germany, and Bulgaria. Clearly this is too

                            Moreover, the loyalty and stability of some of even these regimes is not
                            beyond question. We may find that the domestic positions of <persName

                        <p>The Soviet leaders may hope that a kind of balance can still somehow be

                            Poland, for example). This is far from certain. If the Czech leaders
                            prove unable to keep order or if, keeping order, they end up with a
                            sullen, despondent population that would leave the country as stagnant
                            as it was before, Czechoslovakia may end up as little more than a Soviet

                        <p>Over the short-term at least, this would retard the whole process of
                            normalization in Eastern Europe and perhaps even lead to more Soviet
                            strong-arm actions against others who have not played the game by the
                            Soviet script, e.g., Romania and, less likely, Yugoslavia. Any such
                            eruption of Soviet imperial fury could have the most profound effect in
                            the USSR itself, leading to greater domestic repression but possibly
                            also an upheaval shaking the regime to its foundations. It could also
                            engage Western interests directly.</p>

                            Western Europe and the new disposition of Soviet troops in Central

                            on the German reaction to the crisis. The press has already printed that
                            the State Department was recommending additional reassurances to the
                            Germans even before Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>

                            develop, we are accused of over-reacting. If we don't speak out and a
                            serious situation does develop, then we are accused of not having done
                            what we should have done. This is what happened following an indirect
                            mention of the Romanian situation in the speech of last Friday.<note

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: The gravity of the
                            current situation cannot be overstated in view of the very high costs
                            the Soviet government was willing to pay for intervening in
                            Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>The situation in Czechoslovakia has been developing since 1967. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName> gained power over conservative
                            Communist Party members in January, 1968. Press censorship was lifted
                            and other reforms were initiated. Dissension between Czechoslovakia and
                            the Soviet Union rose rapidly. The summer maneuvers of the Warsaw Pact
                            were used to build up military pressure against the <persName
                                corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName> government in the hope that the
                            liberals would slow down the reform campaign.</p>
                        <p>The day of the Soviet invasion, the President met with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> at 8:15 p.m. and
                            then with the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> later that evening.
                            Decisions were reached at the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had said that U.S. state
                            interests were not affected by the Soviet action. In response he was
                            told that U.S. interests are involved in Berlin where we are committed
                            to prevent the city being overrun by the Russians.</p>
                        <p>Although the Soviet military effort went smoothly, the Russians badly
                            miscalculated the political reaction in Czechoslovakia. All Czechs
                            opposed the movement of Soviet troops into their country. Their
                            performance and discipline were superb. The Russians were unable to
                            organize a puppet government to take over and legitimatize their
                            invasion. Opposition outside Czechoslovakia to the Soviet move was
                            world-wide and very strong.</p>
                        <p>The President: Asked to interrupt the meeting to deal with a proposed
                            press release on the admission of Czech refugees to the United States.
                            The statement was read. (Copy attached at Tab A)<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d93fn4">Not printed. The statement was not released.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: The United States
                            must grant refuge to those Czechs who want to leave their country or who
                            are now outside and do not wish to return. The number is not large. We
                            have to open our doors because if we do not, the refugees might return
                            to Czechoslovakia and oppose the existing government. This would not be
                            in our interest.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>: We should not
                            encourage Czechoslovakian refugees to come to the United States but only
                            welcome them. If we appear to be urging them to come to the United
                            States, the Soviet Union could use this policy to argue that we are, in
                            fact, intervening in Czechoslovakian affairs.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>: Are the borders
                            of Czechoslovakia now open? Are we by this statement inviting another
                            Berlin Wall?</p>
                        <p>The President: We can accept those who desire to come to the United
                            States but not encourage them to come.</p>
                        <p>Director Marks: The draft statement would be read by the refugees as
                            encouragement to come to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>: We should say
                            no more than that the long-standing U.S. policy of offering asylum to
                            political refugees remains unchanged. We should not appear to be
                            accepting the entire burden because we want the Europeans to accept some
                            of the refugees.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>: The statement
                            should say no more than that our asylum policy is unchanged.</p>
                        <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0303"/>
                        <p>Ambassador Cleveland: We should try for a uniform allied policy toward
                            refugees.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName>: The humanitarian aspect
                            is overriding. Let all refugees come who so wish. The refugees cannot
                            resist in Czechoslovakia. The Soviets would like to have liberals,
                            intellectuals, etc. leave Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President: Agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                                >Rusk</persName>. We have to say something. We should reiterate our
                            long-standing policy. Inevitably, many people will compare what we do
                            for Czech refugees with what we did for Hungarian refugees.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>: What did we do
                            following the Hungarian crisis?</p>
                        <p>(Several recalled that thousands of Hungarian refugees came to the United
                            States. Private organizations raised substantial sums to make possible
                            the resettlement of Hungarians in the U.S.)</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Helms</persName>: The statement as
                            read was acceptable.</p>
                        <p>The President: Read a revised statement, commenting that he thought the
                            State Department coordinated such statements. He suggested that the
                            draft be further worked on taking into account all views expressed, and
                            sent back for approval.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Last week there
                            were disturbing indicators and press reports that the Russians might
                            invade Romania, states other than Czechoslovakia, possibly even
                            Yugoslavia.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> Friday evening
                            asked for an appointment for Saturday morning without mentioning the
                            nature of his business. It was possible that his Saturday call would be
                            to inform us of a Soviet move into Romania.</p>
                        <p>The President in his Friday speech referred to the rumors and issued a
                            warning against another invasion.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was asked to call Friday
                            night to deliver his message rather than wait until the next day. The
                            message dealt with the Czechoslovak situation. During this call,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was asked about
                            reports that the Russians were going to invade Romania. He was told that
                            such a move would have incalculable consequences. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he was without
                            instructions but, as he had said previously, he personally doubted the
                            Russians would move into Romania.<note n="6" xml:id="d93fn6">See <ref

                        <p>Saturday evening <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> dropped
                            by to say that Moscow had informed him that reports of an invasion of
                            Romania were without foundation. This was interpreted to be reassurance
                            that there would be <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0304"/>no

                                >Dobrynin</persName> said his comments applied to Berlin as well,
                            although he went on to mention many Berlin developments which the

                        <p>Intelligence available Saturday evening indicated that the Russians were
                            not going to move into Romania. The answer from the Soviet Union to our
                            question about Romania came promptly after the President's Friday speech
                            in San Antonio.<note n="8" xml:id="d93fn8">See <ref target="#d91fn2"

                            hold down further troop movements for the present. However, no one can
                            be sure that the Soviets won't hit Berlin and Romania in the days
                            ahead.</p>
                        <p>General Wheeler: 19 Soviet divisions could move into Romania with two or
                            three days notice. This force could quickly overwhelm any Romanian
                            opposition. There would be little intelligence warning. The movement of
                            Soviet planes, however, we would be able to detect.</p>

                            not been whipping up false scares. We have been careful, in talking to

                            Romanian. We informed the Romanians of what we had done. The Romanian

                        <p>It is important that everyone know we have never had any understanding
                            with the Soviet Union about respective spheres of influence as <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> alleges. The current
                            difficulty arises out of Soviet violation of the Yalta agreement, not
                            out of that agreement itself which called for free elections in Eastern
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>There is a great difference between the Warsaw Pact and <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> with respect to internal affairs of
                            members. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is operative only in the
                            event of international aggression and grants no rights to a member to
                            intervene in the affairs of another.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union is actively trying to put across the idea that its
                            invasion of Czechoslovakia should not affect its bilateral relations
                            with us.</p>
                        <p>We have a difficult problem of handling the American people as well as
                            others throughout the world who would not approve if we act as if
                            nothing had happened. We have cancelled numerous activities of a
                            good-will nature such as a visit of the Minnesota band to the USSR and a
                            second inaugural flight to the U.S. of a Soviet civilian airliner.</p>
                        <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0305"/>
                        <p>On the other hand, Soviet action against Czechoslovakia has not
                            eliminated many major world problems involving the USSR and the U.S.
                            such as the Middle East, strategic missile control, and Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>We must not mislead the Soviet Union, the American people, or our
                            allies.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union is trying to carry on business as usual with us. For
                            example, they have told us they have ratified the Astronaut Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Western Europe reacted with shock following the Soviet invasion but it
                            has not broken off trade relations with the USSR. Many European states
                            have cancelled good-will projects.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> must consider the new Soviet
                            deployments in Eastern Europe. There is a real need to reassure the
                            Alliance.</p>
                        <p>The President: The members of the Council should know that when the
                            Russians invaded Czechoslovakia, they took measures to insure that they
                            would not be blocked. No further mention of this activity should be made
                            but it is brought up for the benefit of those who are optimistic about
                            the Russian willingness to improve relations and reach agreements. (This
                            apparently was a reference to the Soviet missile alert on the day of the
                            invasion.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: The effect of the
                            Soviet action on the policy of détente has been serious. <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members must consult with each other
                            and be seen consulting. High level <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            meetings will be necessary. As to the future of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, it may be necessary to extend now the life of the
                            treaty beyond 1969. The problem is what can we do to reassure <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members that the treaty will not
                            disappear in 1969 which does not require Senate approval and does not
                            commit the new President.</p>
                        <p>The President: We must not forget that a large number of Senators not
                            long ago favored a substantial immediate reduction in the level of U.S.
                            forces deployed in Europe. Some wanted to reduce this number to
                            50,000.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: The country will
                            now have to debate again the amount of its resources which it is willing
                            to commit to keeping peace in the world. There is some isolationism in
                            the United States. As <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was warned
                            at its last meeting held in Iceland, fears of the Soviet leaders as they
                            face a changing world create a dangerous attitude in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>: The Soviet
                            leaders decided to intervene in Czechoslovakia because they felt their

                                a possible eventual defection of a bloc member. Their concentration
                                on West Germany in their propaganda is natural as this is the only
                                defense of their action which carries conviction with their own

                                proceed they will surely have to withdraw substantial number of

                            <item>UN Action—His Government has concluded from press reports and
                                information transmitted by Czech UN Mission that US is giving
                                thought to supporting discussions in <gloss target="#t_UNGA1"
                                    >UNGA</gloss> on recent Czech events. There are indications that
                                Czechoslovakia might even be put on agenda as separate item. His
                                Government believes such action, whether discussion in general
                                debate or item on agenda, would not help Czechoslovakia but would
                                cause harm. Discussions have been held with other socialist
                                countries involved and in opinion his Government there has been
                                solution to difficulties. Therefore, raising this subject in <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> would not only harm
                                Czechoslovakia but all other countries. Czech Government is also of
                                opinion that anything which would plunge world into cold war, such
                                as debate of Czechoslovak issue in UN, should be avoided. Czech
                                Government therefore requests that attempts to put Czech item on
                                agenda or to discuss Czechoslovak events in <gloss target="#t_UNGA1"
                                    >UNGA</gloss> be stopped.</item>

                                    >Duda</persName> prefaced his remarks on <gloss target="#t_NPT1"
                                    >NPT</gloss> by stating that US Congressional action on
                                ratification of <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> is clearly an
                                internal matter and Czechoslovak Government does not wish in any way
                                to interfere in internal affairs of US. Because Czech Government has
                                noticed that certain Members of Congress have asked for postponement
                                of ratification because of developments in Czechoslovakia, it wishes
                                to restate its position on <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.
                                Czechoslovak Government strongly supports <gloss target="#t_NPT1"
                                    >NPT</gloss>. This has been made clear in statements by leading
                                Czechoslovak officials and by fact that, on instructions from
                                President Svoboda which were approved by Government, he, Ambassador
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName>, had signed <gloss
                                    target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> here in Washington. Czech
                                Government's position on and support for <gloss target="#t_NPT1"
                                    >NPT</gloss> has been emphasized both in Geneva and New York.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName> concluded that, in
                                his Government's view, there is no logical link between Czechoslovak
                                events and <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</item>

                        <p>3. UN Action—Secretary responded that he would note Ambassador's
                            statement on behalf of Czechoslovak Government with regard to <pb
                                n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0309"/>raising Czechoslovak events in

                            There was, however, no possibility that General Assembly would remain
                            silent on this issue whether it appears as item on agenda or is given
                            major attention in general debate. It will be discussed for following

                                <item>Our judgment will be based on our national interests. We have
                                    a national interest in rights guaranteed under UN Charter as
                                    they pertain to member countries. We are deeply concerned about
                                    world order. If Charter rights of member countries are not
                                    observed, structure of world order will be disrupted. This could
                                    lead to a nuclear war. Our national interests are based on peace
                                    and right of all countries to develop in their own way and have
                                    this right respected. There are about 120 smaller countries and
                                    four to five great powers. With this combination it is easy to
                                    see what could happen if rights of all guaranteed under UN
                                    Charter are not observed. The guarantees of UN Charter are vital
                                    to US national interest.</item>

                                    prudence in this situation? What are the capabilities? All these
                                    questions must be considered in addition to Czech Government's

                                <item>Peaceful coexistence among socialist countries also concerns
                                    our national interests, particularly when this involves
                                    judgments which are being made in Moscow. These judgments
                                    concern the whole world. Similar action such as that taken in
                                    Czechoslovakia could happen elsewhere. World opinion must try to
                                    have an influence on these decisions. Nations must make their
                                    positions clear so there are no miscalculations on part of any
                                    nation. US takes these matters seriously but has no interest in
                                    returning to cold war period. We have deep interest in peace, in
                                    standards of conduct among nations, and how military forces are

                            Now there are strong feelings with regard to events in Eastern Europe.
                            American public is indignant and shocked and one way of expressing this
                            indignation is by using <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> as a target.
                            Secretary then asked <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName> to
                            inform his Government that President and Secretary are in favor of
                                <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and are working for its
                            ratification but recent events in Eastern Europe have created obstacles
                            to its ratification.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName> thanked Secretary for his
                            remarks and said that if Czechoslovakia is to preserve any of gains made
                            after January an atmosphere of peace is absolutely necessary.</p>
                        <p>7. When Secretary privately asked <persName corresp="#p_DK1"
                                >Duda</persName> if the reason he had stressed that his Government
                            did not wish to interfere in internal affairs of US during this election
                            period was because Czechoslovak leadership in fact would prefer to see
                            ratification of <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> put off, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName> replied Czechoslovak
                            Government meant exactly what it said. He added Secretary should not try
                            to read between the lines.</p>

                        <p>4037. 1. Prevailing atmosphere here and apparently throughout country is
                            one of unrelieved gloom which 50th anniversary celebrations unlikely to
                            dissipate.</p>
                        <p>2. Cause is not so much current effect of Soviet intervention which until
                            now has not greatly disturbed everyday life but what Soviets have <pb
                                n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0311"/>done to break nation's spirit.
                            Hitherto irrepressible film producers who fared well even under
                                <persName corresp="#p_NA1">Novotny</persName> view future with
                            foreboding. Communist member South Bohemian National Council privately
                            predicted that even though situation unlikely to return to pre-January
                            conditions, necessary will is lacking to tackle problems calling for
                            immediate action.</p>
                        <p>3. On larger scale, problems include federalization which has brought out
                            latent animosities, economic reform which under best of circumstances
                            requires strong direction and sacrifice, and party reorganization where
                            certain tendencies toward self-destruction fostered by Soviet
                            interference seem especially manifest. While Soviets obviously bent on
                            producing pliant party and government leadership, it gives one reason to
                            wonder how they envisage country is to be run without provoking kind of
                            deterioration which will eventually redound to their disadvantage.</p>
                        <p>4. Positive factor from our standpoint is that while leaders' statements
                            have been cheerless and in varying degrees submissive, they still enjoy
                            large degree of popular confidence with significant external Communist
                            support and may continue to do so as long as they stick together.
                            Furthermore resistance spirit is strong in many quarters and is capable
                            of asserting itself in ingenious ways, short of being stopped by mass
                            arrests.</p>
                        <p>5. Question is what we can do to offer encouragement. An anti-Russian
                            campaign would revive drooping morale even though we realize the
                            validity of other considerations. Point to keep in mind is that under
                            new circumstances anything we say or do by way of encouragement in this
                            context is not likely to complicate situation for regime or do it
                            harm.</p>

                            general debate<note n="2" xml:id="d96fn2">At the request of the Czech
                                Government, the question of the Soviet invasion was withdrawn from
                                the Security Council agenda on August 27. Thereafter U.S.
                                representatives used discussions on issues inscribed on the
                                calendars of the General Assembly and its subcommittees to highlight

                            Czechoslovakia, shifting emphasis to current blatant forms of Soviet
                            intervention in internal affairs. Apart from non-justification of
                            presence in Czechoslovakia of Soviet troops on basis of unequal treaty,
                            Western spokesmen and media can play up continued presence troops above
                            any agreed figure and outside of reserved areas. Type of gradual
                            withdrawal of surplus troops presaged in Kosygin's statement at October
                            16 treaty signing is obvious intervention in domestic affairs,
                            re-enacting on greater scale the delayed withdrawal of maneuver forces
                            in June–July, and is completely unjustified <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284"
                                facs="0312"/>in terms of Soviet and bloc security. Such surplus
                            forces demonstrate that real mission of Soviet troops is political
                            intervention.</p>
                        <p>7. Publicity can be given to recent activities of Soviet officers in
                            participating in political meeting at which current leadership is
                            criticized, attempting to interfere with schools, and detaining local
                            and foreign citizens without authority. Firm US public statements on
                            order of those during past six weeks on Eastern Europe, Berlin, US and
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> contingency defense planning
                            would continue to stress broad issues, as would further indications that
                            US ready to resume dialogue on world security issues when Soviets
                            abandon acts and dogmas alien to world community of independent and
                            diverse nations. Until such indications received, US stance toward
                            Soviets politically and socially would still be rather distant although
                            it could conceivably soften slightly toward certain Pact allies when
                            they have removed all troops from Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>8. On a government-to-government basis we owe the Czechs very little
                            since they have only caused us trouble and do not wish to be liked by
                            us. On the other hand we feel it is in our interest to keep alive the
                            objectives which the reformists, although Communists, were seeking to
                            achieve and which are bound historically to have lasting repercussions.
                            Meanwhile, we should go on treating Czechoslovakia as independent
                            country until proven otherwise, maintaining normal relations wherever
                            possible and, in any event, continuing and hopefully strengthening
                            contacts and exchanges of all kinds.</p>

                        <p>I spoke briefly with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DK1"
                                >Duda</persName> at today's luncheon for Nat Davis, hosted by the

                        <p>I asked the Ambassador what his views were on the current situation in
                            Czechoslovakia. He said he was not yet pessimistic. He felt that the
                            recent student demonstrations<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2">Apparent
                                reference to anti-Soviet demonstrations by students on October 28
                                and November 7 and a 3-day strike of students in early
                                November.</note> were unfortunate because they had given rise to
                            additional pressures on the <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName>
                            government to bring the populace into line. He hoped that such incidents
                            would not recur since they could only cause serious problems for
                                <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName> and the survival of
                            what he stands for.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he hoped “the events of last summer” would not
                            prove to be an obstacle in the process of diminishing tension between
                            Washington and Moscow, which had been in train before the invasion. I
                            told the Ambassador that certainly the Soviet behavior in Czechoslovakia
                            had had an adverse effect on our relations with Moscow and, among other
                            things, had delayed progress in working out agreements in areas of
                            mutual interest.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador wondered if we contemplated an early start to the missile
                            talks since he felt it was not in either our interest or the interest of
                            the Czechoslovak people to delay them further because of our reaction to
                            the events of last summer. I told the Ambassador that we did indeed
                            consider the missile talks to be in our interest as well as in the
                            interest of world peace and security and we would move on the talks at
                            an appropriate time. We did not feel that the time was yet
                            propitious.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked me about Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName>'s visit to Moscow, and particularly about his

                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and, of course, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> readily agreed.
                            There had been no pre-arrangement between ourselves and the Soviets for
                            this appointment; it was completely at Soviet initiative. In response to
                            the Ambassador's query, I confirmed that the subject of missile talks
                            had been raised in the discussion.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DK1">Duda</persName> asked if
                            Czechoslovakia had been mentioned, and I said that my recollection was
                            that the subject of Czechoslovakia had not come up at all.</p>

                                said this was probably so because of transition taking place between
                                US administrations. I pointed out this was occurring in orderly
                                fashion whereas Czech Government itself seemed to be victim not only
                                of transition but disruption brought about by outside forces. Trhlik
                                then said he assumed that no action on US Government's part likely
                                before at least early next year and I agreed this was a

                        </p>
                        <p>The setting is provided in the story of what can and did go wrong in a
                            unique attempt to reform a Communist system. The abuses of the 1950s and
                            of the <persName>Novotny</persName> regime cried out for inevitable
                            correction. Even the Soviets apparently recognized the more obvious
                            inefficiencies and were <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0316"
                            />prepared to admit change. When <persName corresp="#p_NA1"
                                >Novotny</persName>'s control disintegrated about a year ago, pent
                            up pressures and reactions broke loose which became more than the means
                            of getting rid of a repugnant personality but grew rather into a
                            movement with sweeping objectives. For this credit (or in any event,
                            responsibility) goes to the media people, intelligentsia and some worker
                            elements (almost all Communists) who first supported and then impelled
                            the successor leadership on uncharted paths. The new leaders were
                            composed of well-intentioned Party officials whose hands were relatively
                            clean and many of whom had suffered from Stalinist excesses but who in
                            part were inexperienced in national politics and not especially well
                            versed in an understanding of power. A flowering of demands for reform
                            of all kinds—economic, the rehabilitation of persons injured by the
                            past, proposals for drastic federal reorganization—all added up to a
                            burden which a strong stable leadership would have found it hard to
                            carry out even if unmolested from the outside.</p>
                        <p>In shorthand, the main components which challenged the Communist
                            system—and no experiment has yet been permitted to show whether
                            Communism can survive changes of this kind—were: (1) abolition of
                            censorship; (2) almost unlimited freedom of travel abroad; (3) voting by
                            secret ballot with some choice among candidates; (4) a measure of
                            freedom of assembly and association; (5) a ceding of Party dominance to
                            allow a form of parliamentary rule in which other groups could
                            effectively join; and (6) a more tolerant view of East/West
                            confrontations over Germany and the Middle East. An emphasis on human
                            rights was a by-product of all these aims, giving larger meaning to the
                            principle of rule by law.</p>
                        <p>The short-lived Action Program, which was propagated by Communists who
                            had no idea of abolishing total public ownership, was beginning to
                            create a sense of participation, bringing the Party popular credit for
                            the first time in decades. For whatever reasons the Soviets
                            intervened—whether for fear of contagion in other countries or because
                            they saw Czechoslovakia eventually slipping away from their strategic
                            control—their brutal invasion compounded the shock of being deprived of
                            a promised new way of life.</p>
                        <p>The shape of politics remains unsettled, even after the last November
                            14–17 plenum. The Soviet-supported elements on the one hand seek to push
                            reform back into the mold envisaged a year ago, namely that it should
                            lead to a correction of abuses—largely economic—within an orthodox
                            framework. (It is interesting that prominence is now being given to
                            moderate administrators such as Strougal and Cernik who were mentioned
                            as potential leaders at that time and who probably would have succeeded
                            to <persName corresp="#p_NA1">Novotny</persName>'s positions if the
                            Slovak political revolt had not brought <persName corresp="#p_DA1"
                                >Dubcek</persName> to the top.) On the other hand the movement to
                            fulfill the larger aspirations of giving Communism “a human and
                            democratic <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0317"/>face” still strongly
                            survives. Even with <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName>
                            becoming more of a fading symbol, it remains a factor in the continuing
                            political struggle.</p>
                        <p>For the nearest future we are largely limited to efforts outside
                            Czechoslovakia. Although unsolicited, our sympathy and continued concern
                            can encourage the hard core of popular resistance without being
                            provocative. This may be important in stiffening the backs of the
                            leaders who probably have more to fear from direct Soviet bullying than
                            from pressures by their conservative opposition, which is publicly
                            discredited and acts chiefly in response to Soviet instigation. As the
                            Soviets seek to bend the Czechs to their will, we should publicize
                            instances of interference and repression of human rights.</p>
                        <p>Even having been stifled, the Czechoslovak reform experiment will have an

                            position. The manner of its repression has impaired Soviet standing to
                            our advantage. With due consideration to specific matters of
                            US-Czechoslovak interest, that advantage can best be pursued by keeping
                            alive world concern over Soviet methods and by encouraging positive
                            Czechoslovak internal forces.</p>

                        <p>The timing for a reactivation of bilateral relations depends somewhat on
                            the course of the internal political struggle but more importantly upon
                            the establishment of the government which will emerge from this process
                            and the effects of federalization. Both are unlikely to assume clearer
                            form until early next year. In the area of foreign policy the Czechs may
                            now be expected to follow an unswerving Soviet/Warsaw Five line, but
                            given Czechoslovak minimal influence in foreign affairs, this is not of
                            major consequence to us, except with respect to their aid to North
                            Viet-Nam, which again may be a matter entirely of their own choice.</p>
                        <p>Historically, US-Czech relations have been difficult since the war
                            (nationalization of foreign property and Benes's Pan-Slavism were
                            obstacles even before the Communist takeover). Czech officials describe
                            current relations as poor and show little wish for improvement except in
                            fields of unilateral advantage to them. Although contacts were easier
                            during the period of high reform, the benefits to us were largely
                            indirect since the attention of the leaders and their supporters
                            remained focussed on internal affairs. A need for friends where they can
                            be found these days has produced a moderation in anti-American polemics
                            and a politer tone of discourse, but the regime retains its essentially
                            Communist outlook towards the US.</p>

                                embarrassing circumstance for us is the fact we signed a paper in

                                tied up with future East/West trade policy but its restoration to

                                extension to certain other Eastern European countries would seem
                                necessary to enable the Czechs ultimately to pay for a claims
                                settlement of the order we now insist upon. It will be recalled that
                                just prior to the August invasion, US government approval had been
                                obtained for a proposal whereby the Czechs would receive the gold
                                upon payment of an installment on claims and would remit the balance
                                up to an agreed total figure of $44 million in further annual
                                installments following the restoration of <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                    >MFN</gloss>. Realistically the Czechs are probably as aware as

                                giving an impression of friendly ties with the US), and thus perhaps
                                contributed to Moscow's assumption that mutual disinterest existed
                                between Prague and Washington. To the extent the Czechoslovaks now

                            handed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VHC1">Vedeler</persName> two
                            “Reminders” each concerning the desire of a person considered Hungarian
                            by the Hungarian authorities to return to Hungary from the US.<note

                            <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> alluded briefly to the
                            possibility that a consular convention between Hungary and the US might
                            obviate similar problems, which were presently faced both by Hungary and
                            by the US.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> then referred to the

                                >Harriman</persName> and Hungarian First Deputy Foreign Minister

                            general state of US-Hungarian relations. He added that negotiations
                            appeared desirable at this time between the US and Hungary. He asked if
                            the Department had noted the significance of <persName corresp="#p_MP1"
                                >Mod</persName>'s remarks to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                                >Harriman</persName> that Hungary was willing to consider a general
                            settlement of claims with the US. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VHC1"
                                >Vedeler</persName> assured <persName corresp="#p_RJ1"
                                >Radvanyi</persName> that we had indeed noticed this point and were
                            taking it into account. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName>
                            said that a “Polish type” of settlement was desirable, since Hungary
                            would probably be facing fairly substantial claims which it would be
                            hard pressed to pay under the Rumanian or Bulgarian formula. In other
                            words, negotiations, which he felt might require some time, would need
                            to take into account a prospect of increasing trade between Hungary and
                            the US since only through such trade could Hungary <pb n="294"
                                xml:id="pg_294" facs="0322"/>expect to raise the necessary dollar
                            sums to make payments on a general claims settlement (<persName
                                corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> indicated that Hungary would
                            seek compensation for the stock of the Babolna horsebreeding farm, which
                            he alleged had been dispersed in the US).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VHC1">Vedeler</persName> asked what progress
                            had Hungary made in settling the problem of meat inspection requirements
                            for export of its meat products to the US. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1"
                                >Radvanyi</persName> said that this question was now in the hands of
                            the technicians, and that by late February the Hungarian agricultural
                            authorities would transmit evidence of Hungarian inspection standards to
                            the US Department of Agriculture. In this respect he wondered if the US
                            would agree to the establishment in New York of a one-man office
                            representing Agrimpex to handle commercial sales of meat to the US, much
                            as the Yugoslav and Polish trade offices in New York handled their
                            respective exports. The office could be “temporary“, would be strictly
                            commercial, and would not be a part of the Hungarian Legation's
                            Commercial Counselor's office. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VHC1"
                                >Vedeler</persName> said that the Department would look into the
                            matter. It was emphasized to <persName corresp="#p_RJ1"
                                >Radvanyi</persName> that no <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            treatment of Hungary was possible under existing legislation.</p>
                        <p>In turning to another subject, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VHC1"
                                >Vedeler</persName> referred to various press reports about possible
                            withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary and asked the Hungarian Charge
                            whether he believed there was any basis for such reports. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> replied that he had no official
                            knowledge of any proposed withdrawal, but that it was not impossible.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> thought personally
                            that such a withdrawal was unlikely since the troops were mostly
                            technical forces concerned with such matters as air defense under the
                            Warsaw Pact and included very little infantry. Soviet forces were
                            unnecessary for internal security in Hungary and there could be no
                            question on this score. Besides, the average Hungarian, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> claimed, did not mind seeing
                            Soviet forces remain in Hungary in order to minimize the need for
                            Hungarian conscripts. In his opinion, withdrawal of Soviet forces from
                            Hungary would be contingent on some international security arrangement
                            such as a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact
                            Non-aggression agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VHC1"
                                >Vedeler</persName> suggested that it was difficult to see any
                            operational or strategic purpose in the retention of Soviet troops in
                            Hungary given the nature of modern military weapons. The absence of
                            Soviet forces from Czechoslovakia and their withdrawal from Bulgaria and
                            Rumania would support this view.</p>
                        <p>At this point, Chargé <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName>
                            casually mentioned that he was pleased to report that as of January 1,
                            1964, the Hungarian Government had ceased jamming of the <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>
                            and BBC radio broadcasts to Hungary. (The Department later learned that
                            Hungarian Second Secretary Istvan Varga told Mr. Carl Sharek of <gloss
                                target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> the same thing at approximately the
                            same time.) As to <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>, Hungary found
                            this official organ to be a “serious” station: he intimated, however,
                            that the Department might <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0323"/>seek
                            to have <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> be “more objective”. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VHC1">Vedeler</persName> expressed
                            gratification at the official information conveyed by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> that the Hungarian authorities
                            were stopping the jamming of broadcasts. Both Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VHC1">Vedeler</persName> and Mr. Squire noted that
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> endeavored to be entirely
                            factual in its reporting and dealt to a great extent with American life
                            and developments. As to <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> said that Premier Kadar had
                            decided to cease jamming of this station to bring some humor into the
                            life of Hungarians, since <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> broadcasts
                            were so ridiculous they could not be taken seriously. In his personal
                            estimation, the Charge continued, <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>
                            would probably not continue for more than a year. The Department's
                            representatives indicated that while <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>
                            was not an official organization they could not agree with this
                            estimate.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> next adverted to Cardinal
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJ1">Mindszenty</persName>. The US, he said,
                            should put pressure on the Vatican to find a solution of the case. It
                            was unfortunate that there was no provision in the Catholic Church for
                            the pensioning of Cardinals, he continued, since this might permit a
                            solution of the issue. The US should play a leading part in the
                            settlement of the <persName corresp="#p_MCJ1">Mindszenty</persName>
                            problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VHC1">Vedeler</persName> pointed out
                            that the primary responsibility in any solution of the problem lay with
                            the Hungarian government and the Vatican. He referred in this connection
                            to the statement of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Mod</persName> in his
                            conversation with Governor Harriman that negotiations were in progress
                            between Budapest and the Vatican on this and other Church-State matters.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> indicated that these
                            talks were not progressing very speedily.</p>
                        <p>In a discussion of cultural exchanges, there was agreement that gradual
                            progress had been made during the past year. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VHC1">Vedeler</persName> asked what impressions the
                            Charge had of the success of the recent visits to Budapest of Messrs.
                            Steinbeck and Albee. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> said
                            that he was uninformed about these visits except in a general way. He
                            mentioned the successful visit to the US of First Deputy Minister of
                            Agriculture <persName corresp="#p_HJ2">Janos Hont</persName>, and the
                            favorable articles which Hont had written recently in ”Nepszabadsag”.
                            Both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VHC1">Vedeler</persName> and Charge
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> believed that
                            satisfactory steps, often of a non-official character, were being taken
                            in the cultural and exchanges field without any written agreements or
                            protocols between the US and Hungary, and that this pragmatic approach
                            was the best in dealing with these activities. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> then asked how the US viewed
                            the travel to the US of MTI Director General Sandor Barcs, who would
                            come as the private guest of the AP. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VHC1"
                                >Vedeler</persName> said that the trip seemed to be an excellent
                            idea, particularly since we knew something of the importance of Barcs at
                            Budapest. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> confirmed the
                            fact of Barcs' influence within the Hungarian Government.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> noted that
                            he was contemplating arranging for the visit of Istvan Tompe, Head of
                            the Hungarian Radio and Television, to the US. Tompe was also a close
                            personal friend of Premier <persName>Kadar</persName>
                            <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0324"/>and had modernized news
                            coverage on the Hungarian Radio and Television. Now the Hungarian radio
                            carried much better news than did the Hungarian newspapers, and in much
                            more objective fashion. He intimated that it might be possible during a
                            visit by Tompe here to arrange a meeting between him and the authorities
                            responsible for Hungarian broadcasts of <gloss target="#t_VOA1"
                                >VOA</gloss>, and perhaps even arrange network exchanges. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VHC1">Vedeler</persName> said that we would be

                            availability of refuge, he did not appear to focus on contents of

                        <p>In hour and half talk Cardinal made three principal points: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Preoccupied with position of five bishops in Hungary who not
                                    allowed in their diocese and with position of bishops in
                                    Slovakia, for which he says he is responsible, who may be in
                                    similar position. Fears reported church state negotiations will
                                    not protect interests of these old faithful members of clergy
                                    for whom he feels responsible. Vatican appears to him to be too
                                    disposed to arrive at accommodations with <gloss target="#t_EE1"
                                        >EE</gloss> regimes.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>As long as there is smallest percentage of chance of change in
                                    Hungary, feels he should hold himself available to play his
                                    constitutional role when appropriate time comes. Saying he did
                                    not know what lay in the future, he recalled that one of his
                                    predecessors, Yorgys Zechenyi, lived to be 107 years old.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Described attitude of Vatican and <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                        >USG</gloss> as two key factors in his position. Vatican's
                                    plan to have him come to Rome would represent a “careless”
                                    attitude on his part toward his responsibilities here and to
                                    loyal priests for whose appointments he had been responsible.
                                    While he did not think <gloss target="#t_GOH1">GOH</gloss> would
                                    arrest him now if he left Legation, to either return to his
                                    native village or be subject to living conditions of priests who
                                    had been faithful to him would be intolerable. He professed to
                                    find satisfication in nature of written response given him that
                                    asylum in American Legation continued to be available.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>We took suitable opportunity to point out to <persName corresp="#p_MCJ1"
                                >Cardinal</persName> that, while we were sympathetic to humane
                            considerations prompting his feelings, <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> not competent to deal with problems involving church
                            and primacy. We called his attention to relevant portions of statement
                            bearing on these and expressed gratification that he would shortly be
                            able to discuss these problems in depth with a representative of
                            Vatican. With respect to availability of asylum, we called his attention
                            to terms and conditions in statement and to our government's hope that
                            reasonable solution could be found to problem of refuge. He did not
                            appear to really focus on statement as whole or on portions to which we
                            called his special attention. At end he thanked us for letter and its
                            “supplement.” Statement not left with him.</p>

                            approval to accept a Hungarian offer to initiate confidential bilateral

                        </p>
                        <p>If successful, these talks could produce several immediate and specific
                            benefits, including: (1) the settlement of claims by American citizens
                            for losses suffered from Hungarian nationalization and/or acquisition of
                            American-owned property; (2) improved protection for American citizens
                            in Hungary through the establishment of mutually acceptable consular
                            arrangements; (3) rejoining of families separated since the Communist
                            takeover, and more particularly in the wake of the 1956 revolution; (4)
                            some increased trade; and (5) greater contacts between Americans and
                            Hungarians resulting from improved diplomatic relations.</p>
                        <p>In a larger sense there is a long range and substantial advantage that
                            could accrue from an improved American presence in Budapest. Hungary has
                            perhaps gone farther than any other satellite in de-Stalinizing the
                            Communist system and the movement in that direction continues. With
                            strong representation there, the United States would be in a better
                            position than it now is to take advantage of this situation and make its
                            views and influence felt and understood.</p>
                        <p>On balance, it seems clearly in our interest to accept the Hungarian
                            offer for these discussions and if you approve, they could get under way
                            in Budapest on or about May 15.</p>

                        <p>On September 10, 1964, at 3:00 p.m., Hungarian émigré leaders Ferenc Nagy
                            and Monsignor Bela Varga called on Mr. <persName>Davis</persName> at
                            their request. Msgr. Varga opened his remarks by noting that, although
                            he could not speak for the entire Hungarian Committee, he and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nagy</persName> were in agreement with US
                            policy towards Hungary. The US policy of building bridges to Eastern
                            Europe had impelled Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nagy</persName> and
                            himself to go to Europe to observe its effect, particularly, the
                            reaction of Hungarians. He was glad to say that the news from Hungary in
                            this regard was very good. Hungarians had hope in America and were
                            waiting for America not to start a war or a revolution but to make even
                            further progress in inducing peaceful liberalization in Hungary. After
                            spending considerable time in Vienna talking to the stream of travelers
                            coming out of Hungary, Msgr. Varga said that he had gone alone to Rome,
                            where conversations with Vatican officials showed that the Vatican's
                            policy was parallel to that of the US, namely aimed toward inducing the
                            liberalization of Hungary's internal regime.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nagy</persName> noted that since this US
                            policy towards the <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> countries had first
                            been presented by Assistant Secretary Tyler in late 1962 and later
                            reiterated even more strongly by Deputy Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> before the European
                            Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d105fn2">The text of the Tyler statement was not found. The
                                reference to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s
                                testimony is apparently to a statement made to the House Foreign
                                Affairs Committee in April 1964. For text, see House of
                                Representatives, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Recent Developments

                            he and Msgr. Varga had supported that policy in a positive fashion.
                            Indeed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nagy</persName> and Msgr. Varga
                            favored closer US-Hungarian contacts because they realized that no
                            matter how long Communist <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0331"
                            />regimes lasted the Hungarian people needed to survive under the best
                            obtainable economic and moral conditions. Among the émigrés, opinions
                            were divided. It was needless to say that some exiles felt it was better
                            not to sell grain to Hungary, for they feared this helped the Government
                            and thus tended to lengthen the rule of the Communists. He and Msgr.
                            Varga were not of that opinion, however. While he did not know what
                            future events would bring real changes in the form of Hungary's
                            Government, in the meantime the Hungarian people must live and survive.
                            The Hungarian population situation was particularly bad since, according
                            to the latest UN figures, Hungary had the lowest birthrate in the entire
                            world. This was a reflection of the people's fear and uncertainty over
                            tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>In order to be able to take a firm stand on policy toward Hungary, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nagy</persName> continued, it was
                            necessary to know the opinion of Hungarians in Hungary. He was not
                            concerned to represent the émigrés, he added, but rather the views of
                            the Hungarian people at home. So he and Msgr. Varga went to Europe to
                            meet Hungarians traveling abroad. They had collected a lot of
                            information, little of it new, but all of it strengthening their
                            conviction that they must give positive support to the US policy towards
                            Hungary and Eastern Europe. In the process they had met a great many
                            Hungarians, in Paris and in Vienna. None of the Hungarian visitors were
                            afraid to talk to them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nagy</persName> said that he and Msgr.
                            Varga had asked each Hungarian with whom they had talked what their
                            opinion was of US policy toward Hungary and of the idea of broadening
                            economic and cultural relations between the two countries. The
                            Hungarians were asked specifically if they believed that increased
                            US-Hungarian contacts would strengthen the regime without being of real
                            benefit to the Hungarian people. Not a single person opposed the US
                            policy towards Hungary. Without exception workers, engineers, clerks and
                            farmers asked them to help in bringing about negotiations between the US
                            and Hungary. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nagy</persName> and Msgr.
                            Varga of course told them that the US has a definite policy concerning
                            relations and contacts. While it was true that in Hungary the process of
                            liberalization and relaxation had progressed much further than in most
                            other <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> bloc countries, in Rumania the
                            Government had taken certain steps towards asserting Rumanian
                            independence of the USSR and these steps had made it possible for the US
                            to reach certain understandings with Rumania. The US had not seen
                            similar steps towards independence on the part of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName>. Those Hungarian travelers
                            interviewed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nagy</persName> and Msgr.
                            Varga were not happy at this explanation, and stated that it would be
                            very difficult for Kadar to take similar steps in the near future
                            because of his personal relationship with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>, the presence of Red Army units in Hungary,
                            and the fact that “fellow travelers” in the regime such as <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJ1">Janos Peter</persName> (the Foreign Minister) were
                            so subservient <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0332"/>to Moscow. There
                            were, moreover, no “great” men in the Hungarian Government who could be
                            expected to visualize Hungary's future place in the international
                            scene.</p>
                        <p>The Hungarian travelers offered some detailed advice on economic projects
                            that the US should foster for Hungary. It was suggested, for instance,
                            that the US help Hungary process her bauxite into aluminum, which would
                            give Hungary added use of her most abundant natural resource, lessen her
                            economic dependence on Moscow where the bauxite (and alumina) is now
                            processed on terms unfavorable to Hungary. To set up a smelting plant,
                            the US would have to supply a power source to Hungary. If this were to
                            be an atomic power plant, of the type talked about for Rumania, it would
                            have the added advantage of giving Hungary a reason for keeping the
                            Hungarian-mined uranium, now exported to the USSR, for Hungary's own
                            consumption. In the cultural field, the Hungarian travelers urged an
                            expansion of the US scholarship program for Hungarian students, but with
                            close control of the selection of students in US hands. They suggested
                            that the US should seek to influence the Hungarian Government to abolish
                            the State Office for Church Affairs, which served not to help the
                            churches in Hungary but only to corrupt them.</p>
                        <p>In summary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nagy</persName> noted that it
                            was the opinion of Msgr. Varga and himself that it was indeed desirable
                            to improve US-Hungarian relations, regardless of their basic belief that
                            nothing short of complete independence would be acceptable for Hungary
                            in the long run. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nagy</persName> added
                            that it would be desirable that the US Government, in improving
                            relations with Hungary, should get the idea across to the Hungarian
                            people by radio or other means that the increased contacts were being
                            undertaken for the sake of the people and that these contacts must of
                            necessity be through the Government in order to reach the people. In
                            answer to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VHC1"
                                >Vedeler</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nagy</persName>
                            indicated that in his opinion the most effective types of exchanges with
                            Hungary would be student exchanges and an agreement to allow
                            publications to enter both countries on a reciprocal basis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Davis</persName> thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJ1"
                                >Nagy</persName> and Msgr. Varga for making their views known to the
                            Department and said he was pleased to see that they agreed with the
                            general outlines of US policy. The policy, Mr.
                                <persName>Davis</persName> added, must be developed as occasion
                            presented itself and this is what the US was doing.</p>

                            excuse himself for taking the Secretary's time, but their talk might
                            have some importance for both sides. The very fact of their meeting has
                            implications.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he hoped bilateral relations could move along. Our
                            representatives are talking over matters of much interest to us; this
                            may take a little time to develop momentum, but let us try. When we can
                            move, let us do so; if there are pockets of stubborn resistance, we can
                            by-pass them. We will be glad to review our bilateral relations as a
                            whole. We will look at trade questions broadly in the new session of
                            Congress. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is working hard on this
                            and there is growing interest in the business community. The Committee
                            will probably hold hearings in the first quarter of next year. Whether
                            there will be legislative amendments, for instance to extend Most
                            Favored Nation status, will depend on the Committee's study and also on
                            whether the general atmosphere continues to improve. We recognize that
                            opportunities for trade are limited as long as the <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> door is closed. Meanwhile both sides
                            can give thought to trade possibilities from the point of view of demand
                            and markets. This is not necessarily easy for us, since our trade is
                            organized on a private basis and our government cannot tell businessmen
                            what to buy and sell. From the Hungarian point of view, tourism would
                            seem to be an area where some expansion would be possible quickly. There
                            is a backlog of interest among American tourists <pb n="306"
                                xml:id="pg_306" facs="0334"/>in Hungary and neighboring areas where
                            travel has been difficult for the past 20 years. If tourism increases,
                            we hope the Hungarian Government will earmark some of its proceeds for
                            tourists coming our way. We are in the tourist business too.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> agreed that this was a good
                            possibility. He said it is helpful to have this meeting to obtain
                            personal impressions about the Secretary. If trade possibilities
                            increase, this would facilitate an improvement in relations. <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> status would be helpful generally, not
                            merely for trade.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we are looking in that direction. Whether there is now
                            legislation will probably be affected by Soviet decisions on various
                            outstanding issues such as lend-lease. The Secretary asked whether the
                            agricultural situation in Hungary is good. <persName corresp="#p_PJ1"
                                >Peter</persName> said it was better and that Hungary appreciates
                            the attitude taken by the U.S. last year on wheat sales. The Secretary
                            said we were glad to be helpful. <persName corresp="#p_PJ1"
                                >Peter</persName> said no doubt refugee groups had objected. The
                            Secretary said we have several different generations of refugees. Those
                            from 1956–57 seem to be more moderate in their views than some who came
                            earlier. The Secretary said he had had some contact with Hungarian
                            students when he was with the Rockefeller Foundation, and when he was in
                            Budapest in 1957 he had found a lively interest among doctors,
                            scientists, and others in technical and cultural exchanges, not only
                            with the U.S. but with other European countries. Perhaps there is some
                            possibility of increased contacts. Mr. Siscoe is looking into this now
                            in Budapest. An increase in exchanges would benefit everybody.</p>

                            February 13 with Second Secretary Szluka.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Tyler informed <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> that he
                            was sorry to have to broach a subject not particularly pleasant, and one
                            which he had hoped would not arise at this stage in our efforts to
                            improve relations. He had been informed,<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2">In
                                telegram 508 from Budapest, February 13. (Ibid.)</note> Mr. Tyler
                            continued, of a demonstration which had been staged against the US
                            Legation in Budapest. The demonstration lasted about 45 minutes, from
                            10:00 a.m. to 10:45 a.m. There had been a crowd of about 1000 persons,
                            which included a number of Asiatic and African students as well as
                            Cubans carrying anti-American placards. According to a message from our
                            Legation we had received a warning 10 minutes prior to the event by
                            telephone, from the Protocol Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
                            Protocol had warned that a demonstration was pending and that the
                            Ministry would endeavor to provide the Legation with adequate police
                            protection. The police arrived, however, only after all the lower
                            windows of the Legation had been smashed, after ink had been thrown at
                            the premises, and after two cars belonging to staff members of the
                            Legation had been completely wrecked. The first floor theater and snack
                            bar were penetrated briefly and the furniture thrown about; the US seal
                            was pulled down from the front door.</p>
                        <p>It was particularly significant, Mr. Tyler continued, that an organizer
                            of the demonstration, a Hungarian, was overheard at the end of the mob
                            action instructing Asiatic and African students to “return to the house”
                            where they would be formally thanked for their participation. Mr. Tyler
                            informed Chargé <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> that Mr.
                            O'Shaughnessy had already lodged a strong protest in Budapest, and had
                            asked the Hungarian Government to pay for the damages which had resulted
                            from this demonstration.</p>
                        <p>The US Government noted that the notice given to our Legation about the
                            demonstration was inadequate, and that police protection was inadequate.
                            The US noted further the participation of Hungarians in the
                            demonstration, the fact that windows were broken, cars wrecked, the
                            Legation penetrated and the US seal had been torn down.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Tyler added that very frankly he was surprised that this
                            demonstration had been organized and permitted at a time when we were
                            making useful progress together to resolve our outstanding problems. We
                            were all the more surprised since, to our knowledge, this was the first
                            time such a demonstration had occurred in Budapest since the war. The US
                            was also mindful of the fact that there had recently been demonstrations
                            in countries which were immediate neighbors of Hungary to the north and
                            south, but that these demonstrations did not result in damages against
                            our diplomatic establishments as in Hungary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Tyler then said that he took this opportunity to remind Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> of the statement made three
                            days ago by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, on

                            demonstration against the American Embassy in Moscow. He then read the
                            President's statement.<note n="3" xml:id="d107fn3">For text of the

                        <p>Mr. Tyler informed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> he
                            would appreciate his informing the Hungarian Government that the US
                            feels that this demonstration and what happened as a result is an
                            unfortunate matter. The US considers that Hungary should have afforded
                            the US Legation effective protection. The participation of Hungarians in
                            the demonstration and in an organizing role gave a particularly
                            unfortunate aspect to the whole thing. The report that African and Asian
                            students were to go “back to the house” to be formally thanked for their
                            participation made a most unfavorable impression on the US.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> said that according to
                            his information the Hungarian authorities had done everything possible
                            to protect the US Legation. He said that he would hesitate to mention
                            all the demonstrations which had taken place against Hungarian official
                            premises in the US.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Tyler interjected to say that he hoped Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJ1"
                                >Radvanyi</persName> was not implying that Hungarian windows had
                            been broken, cars wrecked or seals torn down. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> said that of course he would
                            inform his Government very promptly of what Mr. Tyler had said. Mr.
                            Tyler concluded that he felt bound to tell Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJ1">Radvanyi</persName> that this demonstration was not
                            helpful to the improvement of US-Hungarian relations, and that we
                            supported the protest made by the US Legation in Budapest.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d107fn4">In telegram 469 to Budapest, February 16, the

                        <p>The Hungarian Government makes Vietnam the most conspicuous issue in its
                            relations with the United States at the moment. Like other East European
                            Communist governments, the Kádár regime has conducted a strong campaign
                            of denunciation against US policy in Southeast Asia ever since the
                            Vietnamese crisis entered its present phase last February. The regime
                            permitted a destructive attack on the American Legation by Asian
                            students at that time and has subsequently called on the Hungarian
                            people almost daily, through the press, radio, and mass meetings, to
                            show their solidarity with the Vietnamese against the American
                            “aggressors.” It has repeatedly pledged Hungarian “volunteers” to fight
                            against the US in Vietnam in case of need.</p>
                        <p>The campaign casts a large cloud over the US-Hungarian official talks for
                            normalization of relations that got under way last year. The tone and
                            scope of the Hungarian official anti-US propaganda is hardly compatible
                            with any initiatives from the Hungarian side on behalf of normalization.
                            Foreign Ministry officials have, indeed, told us that Vietnam makes
                            progress in our bilateral talks difficult. Hungarian cultural-exchange
                            authorities have cited today's East-West political situation to us as
                            their reason for refusing to discuss plans for cultural reciprocity at
                            this time. Thus the regime is keeping in line with Moscow in the
                            “freeze” that the Soviets have applied to cultural and other relations
                            with the United States, apropos of Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The only positive event here during this entire period has been the US
                            participation for the first time in the Budapest International Fair,
                            last May—and this was an event to which the Hungarians had invited us
                            long before the Vietnamese crisis arose. Moreover, the enthusiastic
                            response of the Hungarian people to the American display there, at a
                            moment when their government was trying to whip up popular condemnation
                            of the US, must only have strengthened the regime's prejudice against
                            opening the doors to any substantial increase of American cultural
                            influence.</p>
                        <p>But while Vietnam has been a factor in the current Hungarian “go slow”
                            policy toward our bilateral relations, it appears to be more of an
                            additional reason than an original one for this policy. The Kádár regime
                            has, in fact, taken a cautious, slow approach to normalization from the
                            start and has indicated a hard bargaining posture. Foreign Ministry
                            officials from the outset of our talks have stressed the view that it is
                            mainly up to the United States to make the political and trade
                            concessions on which normal relations will depend. The Hungarians took a
                            non-committal or negative position on official cultural exchanges
                            initially as well as later, and the Foreign Ministry indicated its
                            touchiness toward even the suggestion of a possible future <gloss
                                target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> operation in Hungary. In other
                            fields, the Ministry has never responded to US proposals regarding
                            useful steps that might be taken toward improved relations, such as
                            permitting a relatively small number of dual nationals to emigrate from
                                <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0338"/>Hungary to the US, and the
                            abolition of arbitrary ceilings on our diplomatic missions. With regard
                            to negotiation of US financial claims against Hungary, the Hungarian
                            side by raising large counterclaims indicated that it was prepared to
                            take a tough stand and to protract the bargaining process for years, if
                            need be, in order to obtain favorable terms.</p>
                        <p>The official Hungarian attitude to date suggests that while the Kádár
                            regime would like to obtain the prestige and other benefits of fully
                            normal relations with the United States, it hopes to do so at the
                            smallest possible cost. The regime is quite conscious of the avowed US
                            interest in building “bridges” to Eastern Europe for the purpose of
                            exerting political leverage in this part of the world, and of the
                            Administration's plans for seeking East-West trade legislation for this
                            purpose; and it will be watching carefully to see what the American side
                            is prepared to offer. With regard to cultural and other relations, the
                            Hungarian leadership is quite willing, in its desire for Western
                            technical information, to take advantage of such opportunities as the
                            Ford Foundation grants—currently enabling several dozen Hungarians to
                            train in the United States—but is clearly not anxious to move into a
                            program of official exchanges of a kind that would sharply increase the
                            American presence in Hungary.</p>
                        <p>In view of these various considerations it seems likely that the
                            Hungarian Government will continue to proceed very cautiously and cagily
                            in its negotiations of “normalization” with the United States. It will
                            doubtless continue to stall on any conspicuous normalization proposals
                            as long as East-West tensions (and Moscow's example) call for this, and
                            will use Vietnam as an excuse for dragging its feet. The Hungarians are
                            careful not to shut any doors, however, and to maintain correct, even
                            friendly official relations at the personal level regardless of the
                            current propaganda campaign against our “imperialism.” They will
                            undoubtedly be ready to bargain with us more actively, though always
                            shrewdly, for the advantages they seek, the moment any relaxation
                            appears in East-West affairs.</p>

                            it was so serious. The Secretary said he appreciated Peter's expressions
                            of sympathy.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> than asked the Secretary
                            whether the United States planned to send another Chargé d'Affaires to
                            Budapest, or whether it might be possible for Hungary and the United
                            States to exchange ambassadors. The Secretary replied that he wished to
                            consider this question but reminded <persName corresp="#p_PJ1"
                                >Peter</persName> of the special problem which might well stand in
                            the way of such a development. <persName corresp="#p_PJ1"
                                >Peter</persName> remarked that it would be “useful” to get rid of
                            that obstacle. When the Secretary observed that the United States
                            thought that the Vatican was working for a solution to the problem,
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> replied that the Vatican
                            was really not interested in a solution. He claimed that the Vatican
                            regards the present situation as the best possible, particularly since
                            the presence of <persName corresp="#p_MCJ1">Cardinal
                                Mindszenty</persName> in Rome could be a major embarrassment.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> said that the Hungarian
                            Government was in contact with the Vatican, and he suggested that US
                            intervention with the Vatican would be useful. He repeated his earlier
                            statement that the Vatican did not appear to be interested in a
                            solution, and the Secretary said that he would review the problem.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> asked whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCJ1">Cardinal Mindszenty</persName>'s presence posed an
                            insurmountable obstacle for the exchange of ambassadors. The Secretary
                            replied that the required Senatorial approval for ambassadorial
                            appointments did pose a problem in the case of Hungary. Peter replied
                            that he had the impression that the Secretary was able to control the
                            Senate. The Secretary laughed and said that Mr. Radványi had been
                            misleading his authorities in Budapest if <persName corresp="#p_PJ1"
                                >Peter</persName> thought the Administration was able to control the

                            considered unfriendly. First was publicizing Bernat defection,<note

                            Hungarian UN Mission on June 1 and 2 by anonymous male callers who
                            attempted induce them to defect. Jozan said, in response queries by

                            misrepresent essential facts in case. Information made available in

                        <p>3. Re telephone calls to Hungarian Mission personnel, McKisson expressed
                            concern and regret that Hungarian personnel had been subjected such
                            improper approaches but added that it was his firm conviction that such
                            calls were the work of individual “cranks” and that there was no reason
                            whatsoever to attribute such harassments to US officials. Department
                            officer expressed his hope Hungarian Embassy and Hungarian UN Mission
                            would report all such harassments promptly to US authorities and
                            affirmed US concern and readiness take all possible steps to investigate

                            relations are disturbed at two levels: (1) On world level, by US

                            at bilateral level, by US trade discrimination against Hungary,

                                State, Central Files, POL HUNG–US)</note> had concurred in this
                            general approach.</p>
                        <p>2. Under consular matters, stated that we would be prepared to negotiate
                            a consular convention with the Hungarian Government. This would serve a
                            mutually useful purpose, regularize the handling of cases involving our
                            respective nationals, and make a contribution to tourism. In this
                            context, cited Csala case,<note n="4" xml:id="d112fn4"> Csala, an
                                American citizen of Hungarian birth, was arrested, convicted of
                                espionage in March 1966, and sentenced to 6 years in prison. He was
                                released in October 1968.</note> noting that it was a current
                            irritant in our relations and expressing the hope that the Hungarian
                            Government would move toward its early resolution.</p>
                        <p>3. Under cultural contacts, observed that, as Lisle had already told
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nagy</persName>, we were prepared rescind
                            our Sept 1 1955 restrictions if the Hungarian Govt took reciprocal
                            action. We hoped that greater scope could be given us in field of media
                            exchanges, e.g. circulation of cultural bulletin and publications such
                            as “Amerika“, now distributed in USSR and Poland, and mutual exchange of
                            radio and television programs. Added that regularization of arrangements
                            for treatment of performing artists would also be useful, as would
                            increased scope for US participation in English-language instruction
                            programs. Expressed concern that, precisely at this juncture the
                            Hungarian authorities had seen fit to cancel IUCTG exchange program, and
                            urged that Hungarian Govt consider whether it would not wish restore
                            this program.</p>
                        <p>4. In economic area, noted that while Congress had not granted the
                            President requested authority to grant most-favored-nation treatment to
                            countries as Hungary, we had taken earlier action to liberalize export
                                <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0344"/>license controls, would as
                            usual participate in next year's International Trade Fair in Budapest,
                            were discussing with appropriate Hungarian authorities American sanitary
                            requirements affecting Hungarian meat exports to US, and were prepared
                            exchange patent gazettes. Also noted that, while the situation was
                            difficult, we hoped take up again at a suitable time question of
                            financial claims.</p>
                        <p>5. Finally, in area of diplomatic problems, raised question of Embassy
                            personnel ceilings and travel restrictions along lines indicated in
                            Deptels 56033 and 71229.<note n="5" xml:id="d112fn5">Telegram 56033,

                        </p>
                        <p>6. In concluding presentation, observed that, in many of these areas,
                            Hungarian practice was more stringent than that of other socialist
                            countries. We hope begin discussion of details with Hungarian
                            authorities soon, and assumed that FonMin would appropriately instruct
                            Deputy FonMin <persName corresp="#p_SB1">Szilagyi</persName> and
                            Ambassador Hazi (head of Dept V) who would presumably have to bear main
                            burden, in this sense.</p>
                        <p>7. In response, Foreign Minister said that he too could accept the
                            general approach which had been outlined, that is, to negotiate on a
                            pragmatic case by case basis in an effort to achieve specific
                            improvements. Hungarian Govt would be prepared to discuss anything US
                            wished to raise. He had to point out, however, that Hungarian
                            authorities could not overlook the general international situation. They
                            could not come to any agreements with the US of a political nature which
                            would be misinterpreted by Hungarian people and their allies as
                            representing tacit acceptance of US actions which government did not
                            approve. Hungary must maintain posture of sincerity and consistency in
                            this respect. When I asked him how he defined political agreements,
                            since the four areas which I had described were essentially
                            non-political, <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> indicated
                            that particularly cultural field tended have political overtones.
                            Moreover, too lenient treatment in Csala case would be misunderstood by
                            Hungarian people under present circumstances. Should specific actions
                            occur which would contribute towards an improvement of relations, the
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs might be able exercise more influence in the
                            case.</p>
                        <p>8. In his view, <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> continued,
                            the economic field seemed particularly suitable for progress at this
                            point. Anything which would contribute to increased trade between
                            Hungary and the US would be all to the good, and would lead to a real
                            betterment of relations. He personally saw no reason why we should not
                            make another effort to move towards a claims settlement, although the
                            Hungarian negotiators, after the abortive round last spring, had
                            reported to him that negotiations had reached <pb n="317"
                                xml:id="pg_317" facs="0345"/>a dead end. In any event, Hungarian
                            Govt would be pleased to resume negotiations on claims at any time the
                            US wishes.</p>
                        <p>9. Before I left, <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> requested
                            that my presentation be summarized in aide-mémoire to be furnished to
                            him as soon as feasible. I agreed and hope to have delivered to him
                            start of business tomorrow morning. Text will be forwarded by

                            problems between Hungary and US, despite the international situation to
                            which they make reference in stock phrases. Neither <persName

                            of forebearance which I had not expected but significance of which
                            should not be overemphasized in evaluating actual prospects.</p>
                        <p>11. As soon as <persName corresp="#p_SB1">Szilagyi</persName> and Hazi
                            return from their trip to Western Europe, Embassy will approach them
                            with view to opening detailed discussions. We must expect, however, that
                            any progress in achieving even minimal US objectives will follow a very
                            measured pace. Hungarian authorities are unlikely overlook fact that,
                            upon analysis, balance of practical advantage in nearly all of areas
                            indicated other than those economic ones in which progress is least
                            likely, falls on side of US. We may, however, expect a small initial

                            <item>My introductory call today on Party First Secretary <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KJ1">Janos Kadar</persName> lasted one hour and ten
                                minutes. He obviously wanted to go beyond the usual exchange of
                                pleasantries for such an occasion, and after a few minutes launched
                                into a long, somewhat discursive but obviously prepared statement of
                                how he saw the state of relations between US and Hungary. There was
                                no false modesty, and he spoke with the assurance of someone who is
                                not only party boss but the real power in this country.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> began by welcoming fact
                                that US had sent its first Ambassador to Hungary. This was useful
                                step, although fact that it had taken nearly a year to accomplish
                                after initial announcement was in itself indicative of our current
                                difficulties. When last December US had proposed a date for
                                announcement of mutual raising of diplomatic establishments to
                                Embassy rank, this date by accident happened to coincide with an
                                important party congress in Budapest. When it was suggested that it
                                might be inopportune to make such an announcement at that time, he
                                had brushed this objection aside, since he sincerely believed the
                                value of establishing full relations with the US and saw no reason
                                to qualify such a step, or to postpone its public announcement,
                                merely because of a party meeting. The great majority of the
                                Hungarian people undoubtedly support better relations with the US,
                                and this was a fact that any Hungarian leader had to take into
                                account.</item>

                            <item>He had been fully informed of my previous discussions with
                                Hungarian officials including that yesterday with Parliament
                                President Kallai (reported A–199 Nov 30, 1967),<note n="2"

                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> continued, and had taken
                                note of the statements made. The task of a new Ambassador in
                                Budapest would in some respects be pleasant but in other respects
                                difficult. It would be pleasant because the Hungarian authorities
                                were prepared to deal sympathetically with outstanding problems
                                between the two countries in an effort to dispose of those which
                                would be solved. They would be polite and helpful in every
                                legitimate way. The Ambassador's role would, however, be difficult
                                because of the admitted differences between Hungary and the US on
                                major issues. He recalled that a school friend of his who had
                                planned to become a diplomat had once lent him a <pb n="319"
                                    xml:id="pg_319" facs="0347"/>manual for students of diplomacy.
                                From this he had learned that a primary function of diplomacy was to
                                strive to achieve peaceful solutions of outstanding problems. In
                                this sense, the US would find that the Hungarian Government
                                practiced diplomacy in its best form. He wanted us to know that the
                                Hungarian authorities were really sincere in their espousal of
                                peaceful coexistence as the only rational approach today between

                                It might not have been possible to say this 20 years ago, when the
                                force of ideologies was much more intense, but the basic problem
                                today was to avoid the outbreak of nuclear war between the two
                                superpowers.</item>

                                attention two problems between Hungary and the US which he felt it
                                useful to examine for their illustrative value. The first of these
                                was the <persName corresp="#p_MCJ1">Mindszenty</persName> case (his
                                remarks on this subject are being reported in a separate Limdis

                                was the handling of the Hungarian question in the UN. He referred to
                                a chance meeting which he had had in 1963 with Governor <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> (then Under Secretary of
                                State) at the Moscow Sports Stadium. He had compared the situation
                                at that time as similar to two boxers who had been slugging at each
                                other for seven rounds (from 1956 to 1963). Neither could hope to
                                knock the other out, neither was prepared to capitulate, and neither
                                could ultimately hope to gain very much from the contest. Hungary
                                was not prepared to come on its knees to the US, and he knew the US
                                was not prepared to assume this posture before Hungary. As I knew,
                                he went on, the UN problem had now been solved in an acceptable way.
                                If we approached current problems in the same spirit which had
                                finally led to a solution of the Hungarian question in the UN, based
                                upon realistic acceptance of the facts of life, then there was good
                                possibility of advancing towards agreement in other areas.</item>

                            <item>The system which existed in Hungary today is a reality, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> stressed with some emphasis,
                                and it is a fact that it will remain. Compared to the feudal
                                conditions which had existed in the country until the end of World
                                War II, the present system was certainly far superior for the masses
                                of the Hungarian people, who had previously lived in abject poverty.
                                He was willing to concede that many in the US would undoubtedly
                                still like to change the system in Hungary, and he would be the
                                first to admit that he would like to make some changes in the
                                American system. However, as a realist, he recognized that this was
                                out of the question. Mutual recognition of each other's systems as
                                facts of life was <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0348"/>basic
                                premise of peaceful coexistence. Both sides would, of course,
                                indulge in propaganda against each other, but firm and realistic
                                acceptance of this truth would not let the possibilities of
                                improving our relations be submerged by such propaganda.</item>

                                references to Viet-Nam, but he did want to observe that, while the
                                US might win further victories there, it could not in the final
                                result be victorious.</item>

                                the establishment of relations at the Ambassadorial level between
                                Hungary and the US, his hope that I would have a pleasant stay in
                                Budapest, and that both sides would mutually make a genuine

                            <item>I responded by noting that he had indicated he had received a full
                                report of my previous discussions with Hungarian officials, and I
                                would therefore not repeat what he already knew. As I had pointed
                                out in my previous talks, the basic framework of current American
                                policy towards countries such as Hungary was set forth in the
                                President's speech of Oct. 7, 1966, and I hoped that, in the spirit
                                of the speech and of his own remarks about the desirability of
                                coming to grips with the problems between us we could move towards a
                                solution of at least some of them. I hoped soon to begin talks with
                                Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SB1"
                                    >Szilagyi</persName>, after his return to Budapest early in

                                Minister <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> and which had
                                been incorporated in an aide-mémoire sent to the Foreign

                                that our objective in Viet-Nam was not to be victorious in the sense
                                of desiring conquest of the country, but to achieve the limited
                                objectives which had been set forth in numerous statements by
                                American leaders.</item>

                                remarks fell pretty much in the same pattern as those of my previous
                                conversations with Hungarian leaders, I report them here at some
                                length because they represent, I believe, the first contact in
                                recent years between an American official and the undisputed leader
                                of this country. <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName> was in
                                an obviously relaxed, good humored, sometimes semi-ironic mood. He
                                was well-briefed and had apparently carefully thought out the line
                                of argument he wished to use. He seemed to enjoy playing the role of
                                a confident leader big enough to forget the past, and hopeful for
                                betterment of Hungarian-American relations though very mindful of
                                present difficulties.</item>

                                by the seeming discomfort of most officials, and by the cliche-laden

                            <item>We have had reports from good sources that some of the Hungarian
                                troops which were first sent in to Czechoslovakia have had to be
                                replaced by new units. Apparently the troops, who were stationed in
                                Hungarian-speaking area of Slovakia, became infected with views of
                                local population. It can be assumed that the returning troops will
                                bring back their own version of the occupation and that this will
                                filter out to the population at large, which is in any case highly
                                skeptical of regime's explanation of events. This incident is
                                symptomatic of domestic problem facing the regime as a result of
                                Czech events which is likely to persist and continue to give

                                come about not so much as result of Hungarian unwillingness to
                                pursue such a course as lack of Western receptivity. The Hungarians
                                may indeed try to press their efforts to improve bilateral relations

                                criticism of Romania and specifically of <persName corresp="#p_CN1"
                                    >Ceausescu</persName>'s role. Weekend Hungarian press carried
                                several extremely harsh criticisms of Romanians, in effect equating
                                their role to that of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                countries. We note that press shifted its ground August 27, muting
                                attacks on Romania and turning to criticism of Yugoslavia. It would
                                seem that there will be a palpable deterioration in Hungarian
                                relations with Romania and Yugoslavia. In case of Romania
                                especially, such a climate is likely to revive latent nationalist
                                differences centered on always sensitive Transylvania problem. If
                                only in this sense, Czech events mark a new stage in complex
                                relationships in Balkan politics.</item>

                            In order to avoid a repetition of the tactic used by the Ambassador
                            during his call on Mr. Lisle (see Lisle-<persName corresp="#p_NJ1"

                            was to blur the issue by introducing Viet-Nam in response to our opening
                            expression of disapproval regarding Warsaw Pact action in
                            Czechoslovakia, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> took
                            the initiative by first mentioning Viet-Nam and then proceeding to
                            Czechoslovakia. He told the Ambassador that, because of his wearisome
                            conversation with Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SB1"
                                >Szilagyi</persName> in Budapest a year ago,<note n="3"

                            he was familiar and also in disagreement with the Hungarian Government's
                            views on Viet-Nam. Next focussing on the events of last August, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> tersely explained that
                            our efforts toward détente with Bloc countries, including Hungary, which
                            have borne some fruit in the case of the Soviet Union, would now have to
                            proceed more slowly and with more difficulty owing to
                            Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he realized that his arrival in Washington occurred
                            in a situation marked by difficulties but that his efforts would be
                            directed toward contributing to an improvement rather than to a
                            deterioration of the situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1"
                                >Leddy</persName> expressed approval of this intent and mentioned
                            that among the various bilateral problems awaiting solution that of the
                            mission personnel ceilings, in Washington and Budapest, could probably
                            be handled most rapidly. We were interested for security reasons, he
                            added, in assigning five Marines to our Embassy at Budapest.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nagy</persName> agreed that the
                            matter of personnel ceilings posed a problem easy to handle. He
                            continued to say that his Government did not tie in this problem with
                            any other outstanding issue. “My <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0352"
                            />need for increased staffing,” he added, “is not in Washington but
                            beyond the capital city.”</p>
                        <p>This oblique reference to the Hungarian desire to open consulates in New
                            York and Cleveland (see Lisle-<persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nagy</persName>

                            comment from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> that “this
                            was not our case.” On the other hand, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1"
                                >Leddy</persName> continued, we were concerned about two protection
                            cases in Hungary, those of Andrew Csala and Henrietta Blueye. Release of
                            these imprisoned Americans would mark progress toward improved
                            relations, he said.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador promptly replied that Mr. Csala would be released the
                            following day (October 18) and that our Embassy at Budapest was so
                            informed today. He was not familiar with the Blueye case but felt
                            hopeful as to its outcome as well.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said that Csala's
                            imminent release was good news, indeed, and expressed his appreciation.
                            When the Ambassador next took up the subject of US-Hungarian trade, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> agreed that our
                            inability to grant <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> should not
                            prevent some expansion of trade through promotional activities. He
                            mentioned, as an example, the Bulgarian Embassy's current drive to
                            popularize Bulgarian wines in this country. The Ambassador appeared
                            interested.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> terminated the
                            conversation by wishing the Ambassador well in his new assignment.</p>

                            become somewhat crowded because of Soviet wheat purchases on world

                            commodities in the US.</p>
                        <p>Modrzewski then expressed the deep appreciation of his Government for the
                            favorable action on <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d116fn3">Section 402 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1963
                                (P.L. 88–205), approved on December 16, 1963, authorized the
                                President to restore most-favored-nation status to Poland and
                                Yugoslavia.</note> Poland desires short term and other credits from
                            the US for the purchase of agricultural and other products. Although
                            competition for the sale of industrial products in Western Europe was
                            severe, Poland could compete because of the good progress it had made in
                            this area. Poland wishes to expand its exports to the US. Last year
                            Polish exports to the US were probably slightly higher than the year
                            before despite the uncertainty about <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            and the boycott campaign in the US which he now understands has died
                            down.</p>
                        <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0354"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said the US seeks to
                            discourage such actions as the boycott but it cannot always control
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Modrzewski explained that Poland wants to expand its exports to the US in
                            order to be able to meet its debt which will represent an increasingly
                            heavy burden. Poland enjoys and wants to keep its good reputation for
                            meeting its debts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> then mentioned as a
                            limiting factor Poland's unsettled bond debt to Americans. Modrzewski
                            said Poland is aware of this matter, but Poland is still poor. Poland
                            has to be careful about assuming a new schedule of debt.</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s inquiry,
                            Modrzewski said Poland's agricultural production last year was better
                            than the year before. Until the end of October the situation seemed very
                            bad but more recently there were indications that the situation was not
                            so bad as previously supposed. The real difficulty stemmed from 1962
                            when about 2 million pigs and a large number of cattle had been lost. It
                            was now necessary to regain these losses. This year Poland was buying
                            more than 2–1/2 million tons of grain abroad. Although Poland is
                            supposed to receive 400,000 tons of grain annually from the USSR and had
                            in fact received 800,000 in the last few years, Poland had received
                            nothing this year. This month Poland had purchased for cash 150,000 tons
                            of wheat in the US. For the still developing Polish economy these cash
                            purchases abroad are difficult. Grain imports are structural for Poland.
                            The Polish harvest determines the amount of required imports which might
                            vary anywhere from 2–3 million tons. Poland wants to be a regular buyer
                            in the US.</p>
                        <p>Modrzewski said he understands the interest of the US in having Poland
                            increase its commercial purchases in the US. He wondered, however,
                            whether it would be possible to continue <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                >PL</gloss>-480 transactions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he would not want to
                            rule out that possibility. The Poles now have our present <gloss
                                target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 offer. We realize that the shift to
                            commercial purchases is not achieved overnight and that the shift has to
                            be progressive. We are willing to consider the matter
                            sympathetically.</p>
                        <p>Modrzewski commented that for planning purposes, the delay in proceeding
                            with a new <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 agreement was
                            unfortunate. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> regretted
                            the delay and said the US is interested in Poland's problem and looked
                            toward the evolution of our relationship. The US is in the meantime
                            interested in developing its trade with Poland.</p>
                        <p>Modrzewski then inquired about the <persName>Kennedy</persName> Round and
                            declared that Poland is interested in participating. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he was pleased to hear this.
                            Since the US maintains an <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            relationship with Poland, we are interested in the possibilities of
                            Poland's developing a closer relationship with the <gloss

                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said the US approves of
                            Poland's desire to participate in the <persName>Kennedy</persName>

                            bondholders. This matter was previously mentioned by Under Secretary

                            troublesome question of bondholders' claims and get it out of the way.
                            The Ambassador replied that he indeed would take the matter up upon
                            returning to Warsaw this week. He added that Polish export sales in the
                            US had suffered last year, affecting Poland's ability to pay, and that
                            they wanted to be more sure of this ability before undertaking an
                            obligation to the bondholders.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether Polish trade here had not recently begun to
                            take an upward trend again and whether tourism had not increased,
                            remarking that the latter seemed one of the best ways for Poland to
                            increase its dollar earnings. The Ambassador replied that they had some
                            hope of increased trade here this year and that the tourist outlook was
                            indeed better than last year, partly because of an improved political
                            situation in the world. He pointed out, however, that Poland was
                            handicapped in offering adequate tourist facilities, being a war-damaged
                            country with many other pressing economic priorities. The <pb n="328"
                                xml:id="pg_328" facs="0356"/>Secretary said he would make a purely
                            personal comment on this. American tourists like comfortable lodging
                            while abroad, and in ministering to this taste our hotel chains have
                            constituted a stimulus to tourism around the world. As an example, the
                            Hilton chain has contributed managerial services under arrangements with
                            local hotels in various countries. Would such arrangements be
                            incompatible with the socialist system? Would they not rather be a very
                            practical kind of marriage between capitalism and socialism,
                            noninjurious to either side? The Ambassador smilingly replied that the
                            proposed Hilton hotel in Budapest seemed to offer the answer, and that
                            he would seek further comments on this subject while in Warsaw. He added
                            that his Government had even considered building a Coca Cola plant.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Drozniak</persName> went on to
                            comment that US-Polish bilateral economic relations were confronted by
                            no major difficulties at present but that there were certain remaining
                            obstacles, including the Battle Act and the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"

                                default of its obligations to the United States. (48 Stat. 574) It
                                was amended on July 31, 1945, to exempt foreign governments that

                                its provisions. (59 Stat. 516)</note> He inquired whether there was
                            any prospect of the latter being amended. The Secretary replied that
                            this was in the realm of speculation and would depend on the coming
                            elections as well as other factors; there was no possibility of such
                            legislation being amended in the present session of Congress, and he
                            could not answer for the next session. The Senate Foreign Relations

                            said he had been gratified in discussing this with Assistant Secretary
                            Tyler to find that the latter saw no obstacle to US consideration of a
                            Polish proposal along this line early in the fall, since that would be
                            the most propitious time from the viewpoint of Poland's planning
                            requirements. The Secretary replied that he knew of no reason why Poland
                            could not raise the matter with us at that time.</p>

                            the main political problem of interest to Poland.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said that this was, as
                            usual, Germany. However, this time there was a new wrinkle, the <gloss
                                target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1"
                                >Rapacki</persName> is not familiar with <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332"

                                >MLF</gloss>, nor with the new <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                                proposals.<note n="2" xml:id="d120fn2">Reference is to a December 16
                                statement to Parliament by Prime Minister Wilson offering an
                                Atlantic Nuclear Force as an alternative to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</note> However, he feels that the
                            very idea of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would amount to a
                            disruption of the balance of power in Europe, from both the military and
                            political points of view. Under such circumstances it would become
                            necessary for the countries of the Eastern Bloc to do something to
                            re-establish the balance. This might include steps which otherwise they
                            would not wish to take. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1"
                                >Rapacki</persName> is familiar with the various parts of the scheme
                            which are designed to prevent a West German takeover of nuclear weapons.
                            However, he feels that there are no guarantees that such schemes will
                            succeed and he fears that the scheme rapidly will bring about a German
                            finger on the trigger. This is a fear which even the Western nations
                            should share, and in fact, do share. The Germans are past masters at
                            taking advantage of dissensions between their allies, whether such
                            dissensions arise for financial or other reasons. Therefore, the <gloss
                                target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is bound at the very least to
                            exacerbate the relations between the two blocs and deepen the distrust
                            between them—the very opposite of what Poland would wish to see happen.
                            Moreover, Poland opposes all proliferation of nuclear weapons and
                            considers the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as a step toward such
                            proliferation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that he understood the interest of Poland in these
                            questions. He feels, however, that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1"
                                >MLF</gloss> should give the fullest guarantees against the
                            proliferation of nuclear weapons. U.S. policy has always sought a
                            permanent settlement of the problems of Central Europe and ultimately,
                            disarmament in Europe and elsewhere. We do not see how a permanent
                            solution could be found in Europe unless the nations of that continent,
                            and in particular the two groups of the German population, are allowed
                            to determine fully and freely their own future. Such an expression may
                            or may not lead to an agreement to the unification of Germany, but it
                            must constitute an expression of the free will of the people of Germany
                            which will provide a basis for permanent solutions, possibly including
                            disarmament. With regard to nuclear weapons within <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the proliferation of nuclear
                            weapons, the United States has never agreed to do anything which would
                            favor such proliferation; it even opposed the French wishes in that
                            area. On the other hand, we do not know what has happened in the Warsaw
                            Pact. Nations of the Warsaw Pact have openly exhibited in parades
                            weapons capable of carrying nuclear warheads, one which would be
                            exceedingly inefficient for the delivery of conventional warheads.</p>
                        <p>Another point is that there are two ways for a nation to become involved
                            in a nuclear situation. One of these is to possess nuclear weapons. The
                            other one is to be a potential target of nuclear weapons, and there are
                            many of the Western nations which are well within reach of <pb n="333"
                                xml:id="pg_333" facs="0361"/>nuclear weapons poised in Europe. It is
                            because of such a situation that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                            idea has been put forward.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> asked the Secretary why
                            the latter mentioned only Western nations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that a way must be found to prevent proliferation of
                            nuclear weapons, and the U.S. believes the <gloss target="#t_MLF1"
                                >MLF</gloss> provides one such way. The question is not only one of
                            direct proliferation but also of testing. Moreover, the question of
                            proliferation is not one which concerns only Germany, it is one which
                            concerns many nations outside of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
                            such as Sweden, Switzerland and countries of Europe. It is because of
                            the danger of this type of proliferation that the U.S. has been thinking
                            of new types of measures. It should be remembered that the U.S. has
                            proven its opposition to proliferation, even at the expense of irking
                            some of its Allies. We do not know, however, what the Soviet Union has
                            done in this respect. Some of the Soviet leaders had announced that they
                            had given nuclear fuel to China; this may have contributed to the recent
                            Chinese explosion.<note n="3" xml:id="d120fn3">In October, China carried

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said that in regard to
                            the question of proliferation of nuclear weapons, Poland could certainly
                            not be accused of any misdeeds since it neither had nor wanted such
                            weapons. He knew little about rockets except that there are
                            nuclear-tipped rockets stationed in West Germany.</p>
                        <p>Poland has made a proposal for eliminating such weapons from Europe and
                            has attempted to make it more acceptable by broadening the zone from
                            which such weapons would be eliminated.<note n="4" xml:id="d120fn4"

                                    >Rapacki</persName> in an October 2, 1957, address before the
                                U.N. General Assembly. For text, see U.N. doc. A/PV 697. On March
                                28, 1962, he submitted to the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee
                                in Geneva another revised plan for a nuclear-free zone in Europe;

                                201–205.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>
                            was of the opinion that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> will
                            lead to proliferation even if this is not the purpose of those who came
                            up with the idea. He reiterated his view that there are guarantees
                            against German control and his opinion of West German ability in playing
                            their partners one against the other. Even if no independent nuclear
                            strength for Germany is now planned the result will be to bring Germany
                            closer to it and under such circumstances it is possible that,
                            irrespective of their wishes, the Warsaw Pact nations would also become
                            involved in such a proliferation. The Polish suggestion would be that
                            steps toward relaxation of tensions might better be obtained through an
                            immediate freeze of nuclear (and possibly other) weapons at the present
                            levels, than by their gradual elimination from a <pb n="334"
                                xml:id="pg_334" facs="0362"/>certain zone. A plan of this sort, if
                            accepted, could then be joined by other nations. The extent of the zone
                            of armaments freeze could also be something open to negotiation, though
                            it seems quite difficult to see how the Soviet Union could be included
                            in it. In any case Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>
                            does not feel entitled to speak in the name of the Great Powers.</p>

                            prospects of it. The only realistic way to envisage such a unification
                            is through an historical process which would be based on step-by-step
                            agreement on such measures as disarmament and which little-by-little
                            would create realistic conditions under which unity could be obtained.
                            Unfortunately, drawing West Germany deeper into military
                            responsibilities encourages the West German Government to take attitudes
                            which cause concern among its neighbors and thus bring the situation
                            into a vicious circle.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary wondered if there might perhaps be possibilities of
                            bringing in all of these measures together; bringing about the
                            possibilities for reunification at the same time as discussion of
                            armaments freeze and similar measures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> admitted that these
                            problems are connected. However, the beginning should be made with
                            various disarmament steps and not with the question of reunification.
                            First there must be a détente in which the two German nations would
                            participate. The other questions would then find their solutions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that it is rather the failure to solve the fundamental
                            problem of Central Europe which is the cause of the armaments tension
                            and the disruption of equilibrium. This is something we are not
                            responsible for. It would be difficult to wait for historical processes
                            to take care of the armaments race and the pressing dangers of the
                            moment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> agreed with the
                            necessity of doing something rapidly in order to decrease both the
                            danger to peace and the armaments race. Clearly the military and the
                            political problems are connected. The present situation does not help
                            toward the solution, but on the contrary deepens the opposition between
                            the two blocs. The main irritants are certain attitudes on the part of
                            the West German Government and in general on the part of the Western
                            allies. Only France recognizes the present Polish-German border as being
                            final. Also West Germany acquires more and more power within <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> does not consider West
                            Germany as being a monolith of revenge-seekers. He realizes that there
                            are various shadings of opinion in Germany and that many German groups
                            seek peace. Unfortunately the present policies do not encourage such
                            groups but on the contrary those intent on revenge.</p>
                        <p>Steps toward a solution of problems should begin with a freeze, followed
                            perhaps by disarmament measures. If this path is followed, then a <pb
                                n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0363"/>situation might follow which
                            will bring together the two Germanies. Otherwise the separation between
                            them is bound to deepen. To speak quite frankly, Poland does not desire
                            a common border with West Germany. Even if the majority of the East
                            German people were to express themselves for unification it would find
                            such a solution not acceptable. Free elections would not be acceptable
                            because of such a possibility. East Germany for the moment must be
                            maintained because it is working very hard to win its people away from
                            the militaristic and nationalistic traditions of Germany. Unfortunately
                            West Germany pursues policies which keep alive those traditions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>
                            for his expression of his views. He felt on the contrary that if the
                            German problem is resolved, and thus if security for Poland is
                            established under the fullest guarantee by the United States and by
                            others, the result would be an improvement in economic and social
                            relations which is desired by all. Such a solution would give Poland
                            more security than she has known for two or three centuries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said that German unity
                            might perhaps be brought about by an historical process but no guarantee
                            could be strong enough for such unity to take place now. Poland after
                            all had the strongest of guaranties in 1939 and then lost six million
                            people.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned that the United States had participated in two
                            world wars in which it did not find itself on the same side as Germany.
                            Nevertheless he recognized that Poland had a very special experience in
                            this field. He asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>
                            how the relations between Poland and West Germany were developing and
                            whether they were improving.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said the economic
                            relations were increasing and some cultural relations existed. Further
                            development depends on the German Government. In all frankness, however,
                            in the present situation great political improvements are unlikely.</p>

                        <p>I do not think these differences are of fundamental significance. Poles
                            in own protection must remain loyal allies of Russia. Nevertheless, they
                            do suggest that Poles might desire second string to their bow and might
                            be willing to find it in West. It would seem to me the part of wisdom to
                            encourage them to do this. This view is reinforced by fact that until

                            <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> said that he would like to
                            discuss the question of European security. <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342"
                                facs="0370"/>He referred to recent press articles which argued that
                            the reduction of the U.S. presence in Europe “to unknown limits” as a
                            result of events in Southeast Asia would be welcomed by the Socialist
                            countries. According to <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>,
                            the writers of these articles must feel that the Socialist countries are
                            “politically naive” and he stated that Poland is interested in
                            “constructive” United States influence in promoting the peaceful
                            development of Europe. He asked, rhetorically, how long the European
                            situation could remain isolated from the world-wide trend toward
                            increasing tensions. He observed that the relatively calm conditions in
                            Europe were deceptive and could not last. According to <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>, the Southeast Asian situation
                            could well have an adverse effect on conditions in Europe and,
                            furthermore, none of the real dangers for European stability had been
                            removed. In this regard, <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>
                            repeated the traditional Polish charge that revanchist elements in the
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> are gaining strength and are
                            showing an increasing desire for nuclear weapons to use in pressuring
                            the “German Democratic Republic” and forcing a revision of European
                            frontiers. In his only comment during the meeting, Winiewicz observed
                            that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> wishes to “swallow” the
                                ”<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.” <persName corresp="#p_RA1"
                                >Rapacki</persName> stated that collective security measures are
                            necessary to avert the danger posed by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> and the United States has a role to play in these

                            <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> referred to Poland's 1964
                            proposal for a European Security Conference and said that intensive
                            contacts with countries in both Eastern and Western Europe had led to
                            some progress toward holding such a Conference. According to <persName
                                corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName>, the Europeans generally agree
                            that a Conference would be useful, but he acknowledged that much
                            preparatory work was necessary. In his view, the Conference would
                            consider the basic question of guaranteeing the security of individual
                            states. With this obstacle out of the way, increased economic
                            cooperation among European states would develop naturally. Political
                            questions would be taken up only at the end of the process of
                            normalization. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> stressed
                            the importance of European and world-wide non-proliferation agreements
                            in ensuring peace. He mentioned the problem of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                            was particularly concerned that these consultations should not lead to
                            giving non-nuclear powers a voice in the use of nuclear weapons. He also
                            emphasized Poland's interest in the reduction of conventional forces and
                            suggested that a collective renunciation of the use of force in changing
                            the status quo would be useful.</p>
                        <p>In reply, the Secretary stressed that the United States was “utterly and
                            completely” opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He cited
                            our refusal to assist the French nuclear weapons program, with its
                            consequences for US-French relations, as proof of our determination not
                            to transfer nuclear weapons or technology. The Secretary pointed out,
                            however, that the Warsaw Pact could not have a seat at the <gloss

                            matters. When <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> expressed
                            surprise at this statement, the Secretary said that some of Gromyko's
                            objections to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> procedures appeared
                            to require a veto over <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            decisions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the United States welcomed increased East-West
                            contacts and informed <persName>Rapacki</persName> that the
                            Administration planned to reintroduce the East-West trade bill early in
                            1967. He observed that the question of holding a European Security
                            Conference was well worth discussing and stressed that the United States
                            must be present when the great political problems of Central Europe are
                            discussed. <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> asked whether
                            the United States was really interested in these problems and said that
                            our lack of interest in the Polish proposal for a Conference indicated
                            that we were not. The Secretary pointed to our involvement in two world
                            wars which originated in Central Europe as proof of our interest. He
                            said that extensive preparations were required before a European
                            Security Conference could be held since a conference which fails is
                            worse than no conference.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed an interest in discussing this and other
                            questions with <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> if time
                            permitted before his return to Poland. <persName corresp="#p_RA1"
                                >Rapacki</persName> said that he planned to remain in New York
                            through October 4 or 5 but that Winiewicz planned to stay somewhat
                            longer.</p>

                        <p>These impressions are based on a very small sample of Polish opinion; I
                            talked seriously to about a dozen people, divided about equally between
                            government and non-government.</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Polish Concerns</hi>. Virtually every
                                    conversation began and ended with one subject: the security of
                                    the Polish state. Shadowed by a history of four partitions,
                                    Poles of every type and persuasion—in and out of government<pb
                                        n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0372"/>—express or reflect
                                    their fear that this time, too, Poland will not endure.</p>
                                <p>One remark is worth quoting: When a Polish official and I were
                                    discussing whether Polish inheritance taxes might permit
                                    accumulation of an estate over several generations, he smiled
                                    and added: “Yes, but our country never seems to last long enough
                                    to make this worthwhile.”</p>
                                <p>You have the feeling that you are talking to people living in a
                                    house that has collapsed about them several times; they are
                                    constantly looking at the roof and the walls—in this case, at
                                    their geography. Sandwiched in between Germany and Russia, they
                                    can hardly be blamed if they worry about a fifth partition.</p>
                                <p>Polish concerns seem more of a product of this history and
                                    geography than of the obsessive hatred of Germany I expected to
                                    find.</p>
                                <p>When I said to a Polish newspaperman, before the monument to the
                                    dead of the Ghetto, that this was a monument not only to the
                                    crimes of one nation but to the moral weakness of man, I was
                                    surprised at his agreement. Herb Kaiser (Embassy) mentioned that
                                    the Ambassador, visiting Auschwitz at Yom Kippur, had written in
                                    the visitor's book: “No one of us innocent.” The newspaperman
                                    said that most thoughtful Poles were of the same view, though it
                                    was hard to persuade the average man.</p>
                                <p>Poles evidently don't like or trust Germans, but there's much
                                    more than this to their security concerns. Even when memories of
                                    wartime horrors have faded, the hard facts of geography will
                                    remain—and the history of a millenium in which no Polish
                                    generation was spared war, or foreign rule, or both.</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Polish Remedies</hi>. When you ask Poles how
                                    their security concerns could be met by long-term change, they
                                    say something like this: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>“Dissolve both blocs; limit armaments in Central Europe;
                                            exchange security guarantees; and create a new security
                                            organization in Europe to police the result.”</p>
                                    </quote>
                                </p>
                                <p>The object of all this, they make clear, is to create a system
                                    which will permit East and West to concentrate on the really
                                    serious business of jointly sitting on Germany, instead of
                                    wasting their time opposing each other.</p>
                                <p>But this will be a long time coming, they acknowledge; in fact,
                                    you get the impression they are sceptical it will happen at
                                    all.</p>
                                <p>In the meantime, they say, limited security measures should be
                                    initiated in Central Europe. Hence the <persName

                                        corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> Plans. If we don't like
                                    these proposals, they ask, why don't we make counter-proposals?
                                    There is real Polish bitterness on this point—the more so since
                                    they don't seem to expect us, in fact, to take their concerns in
                                    this field more seriously in the future than they believe we
                                    have in the past.</p>

                                    yet who do not see any likely alternative in sight.</p>
                                <p>This is a prescription for worry—and worry is what Poles do.</p>
                                <p>This worry makes it easier, I would suppose, for the hardnosed
                                    types who run the country to stay in power and to block moves
                                    toward reconciliation with Germany (let alone, more basic
                                    changes in the European status quo).</p>

                                <p>Prospect. Polish security concerns are rooted in their perception
                                    of the kind of world they live in: a world of national states,
                                    each rapaciously seeking narrow national advantage, at the
                                    expense of others. This is the way Poland's neighbors have
                                    always acted (and it is the way that Poland has acted toward its
                                    neighbors, when it could). It is difficult for Poles to conceive
                                    a different kind of Europe. Until they do, I would guess that
                                    they will remain obsessed by concerns over their security—given
                                    the facts of their geography.</p>
                                <p>Our task should be to convey to thoughtful Poles a different
                                    vision of the future: one in which the concept of wider
                                    communities has so clearly replaced nationalism as to make it
                                    evident, even to this stubborn and heroic people, that wars for
                                    national territorial gain have become as unlikely as wars
                                    between feudal lords were after the decline of feudalism.</p>
                                <p>The best way to make this vision convincing is to help bring it
                                    into being—by trying to create viable alternatives to
                                    nationalism in the West, in the East, and in East-West
                                        relations.<note n="2" xml:id="d124fn2">The conventional
                                        wisdom is that nationalism is a good thing in Eastern
                                        Europe, because it reduces Soviet influence. My guess is
                                        that this process has gone about as far as it is likely to
                                        go for some time. The more important effect of nationalism,
                                        from here on out, may well be to strengthen objections,

                                <p>The ambiguity in Polish reactions to Western European integration
                                    is striking. They fear its effect on Polish trade or that it may
                                    become a cloak for German hegemony; they agree that if it
                                    proceeds far enough to subsume German nationalism it will have
                                    been a good thing for Poland. They are puzzled by the process of
                                    community-building; it is unlike anything in their experience;
                                    they watch it with an odd mixture of fascination and scepticism.
                                    That such a Western Europe should be clearly linked to the US,
                                    in the present situation, is questioned by few in Poland.</p>

                                    economic integration among the “northern tier”—Poland,
                                    Czechoslovakia, and perhaps Hungary. They quickly add, however,
                                    that the Soviet Union would never permit it.</p>

                                    a Europe which was more stable and secure because it was built
                                    on a foundation of such communities, rather than merely national
                                    states rolling around loosely. It was well received, but I
                                    wonder how much of this message got through to the Poles. My
                                    guess is that it will have to be repeated many times and in many

                                    the structure of a new Europe taking shape, in which what one
                                    Pole called “our old-fashioned nationalism” is no longer a sure
                                    clue to national interest; if Germany can dramatize this change
                                    by renouncing the Oder-Neisse—then deep changes in the Polish
                                    view of the kind of world they are living in might over the long
                                    run gradually make still further changes possible.</p>

                                <p>Conclusion. The most impressive man I met in Poland was a
                                    professor of moral philosophy (Professor Kolakowski, who has
                                    since reportedly been expelled from the Communist Party for his
                                    courage and creative thought). He spoke of his main concern for
                                    the future: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>“What will our young people believe in?</p>
                                        <p>“Socialism—no one takes that seriously as an
                                            ideology.</p>
                                        <p>“Religion—its hold will decline as the present generation
                                            is succeeded by a younger generation born to city life.
                                            (He may be right, but I was struck by the large
                                            proportion of young people, presumably born to city
                                            life—men as well as women—in church in Warsaw.)</p>
                                        <p>“That leaves nationalism. A generation of nationalist
                                            technocrats frightens me. Such a generation will be
                                            defenseless against temptations; it will not build
                                            anything great. Polish youth needs to be given something
                                            larger than this to believe in.”</p>

                                <p>He was speaking in terms of a need for moral goals, but the point
                                    has wider relevance. Perhaps the goal of building a Europe in
                                    which the new concept of communities could replace the outmoded
                                    concept of destructive nationalism could be made exciting enough
                                    to help fill some of the moral vacuum he feared.</p>

                            package for negotiation with the Poles. Specifically: <list>
                                <item>—We would postpone $21.75 million of the $39.2 million the

                                    a big hump in the repayment schedule—it is four times what they
                                    had to pay us in 1966, and twice what they will have to pay
                                    annually after 1968.)</item>
                                <item>—They and we would agree to use the postponed $21.75 million,
                                    over the next several years: (1) for a $9.5 million/10 year
                                    English language teaching program in Poland, perhaps manned by
                                    young Americans and administered by our universities; and (2) to
                                    help pay for U.S. cultural exchange programs in Poland and
                                    elsewhere; for the operating expenses of the U.S. Embassy in
                                    Warsaw; international travel by U.S. officials from and through
                                    Poland, etc. The Poles would also agree to a firm date for
                                    negotiations on defaulted prewar bonds; to concessions on the
                                    use of other U.S.-owned zloties by U.S. tourists and
                                    businessmen, and on some other minor issues between us.</item>

                            is the English language training program, at an annual $950,000 in

                        <p>We would by and large neutralize the balance of payments effects by a
                            side agreement with the Poles that they would increase imports from <pb

                            amount equal to the postponed payment. We would use their recent level
                            of U.S. imports as a base. This is not fool proof protection, but we can
                            police it well enough to reduce the likely leakage to negligible
                            amounts.</p>

                            too little and asking too much. (An English language program, perhaps
                            with young Americans running around Poland, would be a hard pill for
                            Gomulka to swallow.) John may turn out to be right, and if so, we will
                            come back to you. But the rest of us think that the proposal is balanced
                            enough to be worth a try.</p>

                            package if the negotiation is successful.</p>

                        <p>As a bridge builder I would vote for this. The English language program
                            is a first-rate idea and the cost of the entire package is not great.
                                <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0377"/>Politically, we face the
                            usual risk of helping a Communist country which is making a fuss about
                            Viet Nam, and giving Hanoi some help—the usual dilemma of maintaining a
                            balanced Presidential posture. (If, during the course of the
                            negotiations, the Poles go in for unusual pyrotechnics on Viet Nam, we
                            can always back off. They will be told that no U.S. proposals are final
                            until a deal is struck.)</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Warsaw Pact Foreign Ministers' Meeting</hi>. I opened
                            the conversation by asking Mr. Winiewicz about all the rumors we had
                            heard about a conference going on here in Warsaw. He said yes, there
                            was; it would end today and the people would leave tonight. I said “Only
                            a one-day conference?” He said no, it started yesterday morning. He then
                            went on to say that this is a normal ministerial level conference that
                            takes place a couple times a year and that it did not arise, as some
                            people suspected, as a result of the diplomatic agreement between
                            Romania and the Federal Republic of Germany.<note n="2" xml:id="d126fn2"
                                >An apparent reference to the technical cooperation agreement
                                between Romania and the Federal Republic of Germany. For text, see
                                642 UNTS 47.</note> The meeting is not a result of this; it would
                            have happened anyway. I said I presumed there would be some discussion
                            of the Romanian-<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> agreement; he said
                            they will discuss it but he wanted to make clear this was not the
                            occasion for the conference. He went on to say that <pb n="350"
                                xml:id="pg_350" facs="0378"/>he wouldn't be a bit surprised,
                            however, if the Romanians had hastened their diplomatic accord with West
                            Germany in order to have it de facto prior to the conference. He said
                            there would be no communiqué issued on the meeting other than the fact
                            it occurred.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Relations with West Germany</hi>. I then asked him how
                            this whole developing picture with West Germany is ultimately going to
                            affect Poland. I said I could at least visualize the possibility that
                            the Soviet Union, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia could
                            very well at some time in the future have diplomatic relations, leaving
                            Poland and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> out in the cold. He
                            responded that it did not surprise the Poles to find Romania according
                            diplomatic relations to West Germany. He said the Poles have always felt
                            that those countries which did not have the bad experience with Germany
                            that Poland had, specifically Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary, would have
                            a different attitude toward relations with West Germany than they do. He
                            emphasized that many Poles have expected this for a long time. On two or
                            three occasions he emphasized Bulgaria, bringing in Hungary as a third
                            possibility, suggesting that Bulgaria is the next likely candidate for
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>He said on the broader question of West German-Polish relations, they
                            have to look at this in the light of the history of their attitudes. He
                            said from the time of the establishment of diplomatic relations between
                            the Soviet Union and West Germany in 1955 until the period 1957–58, the
                            Poles repeatedly expressed willingness to have diplomatic relations with
                            West Germany with no conditions, but their advances in this direction
                            were rebuffed by the Germans. He referred to an interview with a British
                            publication which <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> had in
                            the late '50s in which he expressed an understanding that it is very
                            hard for any nation to digest defeat. He said even though we remember
                            this as having been the defeat of Hitler, the Poles appreciate that for
                            the masses of German people it was a defeat for the German nation. Poles
                            were very sympathetic toward establishing diplomatic relations in that
                            period; after 1958, as world conditions changed, especially after '59
                            when Germany started showing an interest in atomic weapons which they
                            had not previously shown, the Polish position was altered to the extent
                            that they insisted on recognition of the Oder-Neisse line as a
                            precondition. At that time, <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                >Gomulka</persName> realized that of course the border could be
                            formally recognized only in the peace treaty, but he insisted on de
                            facto recognition. They also hoped at that time that all Western powers,
                            including the U.S., would give de facto recognition as DeGaulle did to
                            the Oder-Neisse line because they felt that this would make it easier
                            for the German authorities to sell it to the German people; they still
                            think it is a mistake for the Western powers not to take a lead on this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that sometimes it is very costly for a country's friends to
                            attempt to take the lead in matters of this sort; that in terms of
                            internal politics it could create a situation where the opposition to
                            the German <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0379"/>leadership could
                            argue that Germans were not running their own foreign policy but were
                            being forced into an action by their allies. I said he ought to consider
                            the possibility that it is better in the long run to have Germany take
                            its own initiatives in these matters.</p>
                        <p>He then went on to say that conditions have quite significantly changed
                            in the early '60s because things have settled down in the East German
                            regime. East Germany has developed into something quite different in the
                            '60s compared to what it was between '55–'60. It has become stable
                            responsible government and has to be reckoned with.</p>
                        <p>I raised the question of what were the real conditions that Poland had
                            for diplomatic relations with West Germany. I said I knew he had
                            mentioned three things but I had a feeling that the Oder-Neisse line was
                            the most significant and this feeling had been supported by
                            conversations with people in Poland in the last six months who have
                            distinguished between normalization of relations and diplomatic
                            recognition. I had a feeling that of the three conditions which he keeps
                            raising that the Oder-Neisse line is the fundamental one and is the one
                            on which most importance is placed.</p>
                        <p>He said it is true there is distinction between normalization of
                            relations and diplomatic recognition, and then he put a different twist
                            on it. He said they will do all they can to normalize relations; just
                            this morning he had signed off on an approval for an invitation from a
                            group of Polish youth to a group of Christian-Democratic youth to spend
                            their vacation in Poland; he talked about trade and cultural relations
                            which they are interested in developing. What they could not accept, he
                            said, is the German notion that they represent all of the people who
                            were in the German borders in '37. He said, “Look what this means!”
                            There is a law on the books which says that any German that engages in
                            communist activities is violating German law and that means a man like
                            Kmiecik, one of their reporters who was born in Berlin, cannot
                            technically set foot on German soil because he could be arrested for
                            engaging in communist activities on the theory that he is still a German
                            citizen engaged in subversive activity. He said he wasn't saying the
                            Germans would do it; but the law is on the books and that, combined with
                            the fact that many Poles fall under the sole representation thesis,
                            means that technically they are in jeopardy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Relations with East Germany</hi>. He went on to
                            describe their relations with East Germany, saying that they are most
                            concerned about isolating East Germany and creating the impression that
                            all its friends have abandoned it. When a nation becomes isolated it
                            does irrational things and we can't afford to take that chance. A
                            cornerstone of Polish policy must be not to give the East Germans the
                            feeling that their friends have abandoned them. He talked again about
                            the question of irrational activities and in this discussion he made
                            mention of two things: first, that East Germany's statements will become
                            more and more irrational if they are isolated and, second, that any hope
                            for the development of exchanges and <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352"
                                facs="0380"/>relations between East and West Germany which Poles
                            encourage will diminish as the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            becomes more and more irrational: conversations, trade, things of that
                            sort. So, he said, “We must not abandon East Germany and we cannot
                            therefore accept the sole representation claim as far as it applies to
                            East Germans.” He thought the question of atomic weapons would be solved
                            by the nonproliferation treaty.</p>
                        <p>He thus returned to the proposition that there is a distinction between
                            normalization of relations and diplomatic recognition. He indicated that
                            the Poles were unwilling at this time to move ahead and establish
                            diplomatic relations before the conditions for normalizing relations
                            were met.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Zloty Package</hi>. I discussed with Winiewicz the
                            zloty package, pointing out that in the present climate this is of
                            course very difficult for us to digest, but that I was very happy that I
                            got solid backing from the Administration on it. I went over the package
                            and said I thought the conditions that it imposed on the Poles were
                            reasonable ones they could accept without too much concern. I said I did
                            not want to suggest that passing of that part of the program which must
                            go before Congress would be easy, but I expressed confidence that there
                            is a lot of strength behind the President's East-West program, some of
                            it not as publicity conscious as some of its opponents, and my best
                            estimate was that the bill would pass. Even if it didn't, I thought it
                            was highly important that it be brought before Congress because I
                            regarded the Administration program on East-West relations as being in
                            the long run as fundamental as that which is currently occupying our
                            attention—the Viet-Nam question. For three reasons I thought the zloty
                            proposal should be brought before Congress quickly: 1) because anything
                            that isn't in the legislative hopper by the first of May had no chance
                            for a thorough hearing; 2) I think it can pass; and 3) even if it
                            doesn't pass it is highly important in terms of development of attitudes
                            in the U.S. toward East-West relations that this issue be brought before
                            the public in a practical, tangible way. I said I was hopeful that Poles
                            would do what they could to get the thing moving. I knew Trampczynski
                            had been busy and probably he hadn't had time to give it full
                            consideration, but the sooner we can get this out the sooner we can get
                            it before the Congress.</p>
                        <p>He said he was glad to have this brought up and went on to say how much
                            he appreciated knowing my attitude. At 9:00 o'clock last night he said
                            he attended a meeting where the question was raised whether it was
                            worthwhile in the present climate to pursue zloty package negotiations
                            at all: Paul Findley was brought up at this meeting as typical of
                            resistance to this kind of thing.<note n="3" xml:id="d126fn3">See <ref

                            judgment and he would take this up <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353"

                        <p>I said there would be brickbats and I would get a few myself, but I
                            thought it was worth it. The President and the Administration is
                            genuinely interested in putting substance into the building-bridges
                            philosophy and if we can't come forward with this program now I think it
                            will be an irretrievable loss in the development of the Administration's
                            East-West trade philosophy.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Consular Negotiations</hi>. The consular negotiations
                            were dismissed almost out of hand as being held up because the Poles are
                            waiting to see what the Senate does with the Soviet Consular
                            Convention.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Ford Foundation Program</hi>. I discussed the history
                            of the Ford Foundation program, relating my part in getting Stone and
                            Birecki together last fall and my conversation with Birecki a week or so
                            ago, my understanding that Birecki was to invite Stone here and the way
                            the invitation turned out. I expressed my judgment that Stone and
                            Birecki were very close and there was no reason in the world why this
                            wasn't back on the track now; it just needs some catalyst to get it
                            moving. I was reasonably convinced Stone was interested, I knew it was
                            of value to Poland. I noted that Czechoslovakia had just signed an
                            agreement with Ford. At any rate, I was very hopeful that this could get
                            back on the track and felt there was every possibility it would if
                            reasonable heads prevailed. I said that despite Viet-Nam and many
                            problems on both sides of the Atlantic, many of us were interested in
                            maintaining as high a level of bilateral relations as possible; I
                            referred to the Ford Foundation program as being non-governmental but
                            symbolic of these relations. He said he would take this over personally;
                            he had already talked to Jack Fisher about it and he knew Stone was as
                            interested as Poland was.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Zloty Travel Proposal</hi>. I then raised the zloty
                            travel proposal we had made on September 16, pointing out its importance
                            to the many zloty-financed research programs (agricultural, medical,
                            fishing, etc.) currently underway in Poland. I described the research in
                            summary fashion. I suggested that maintaining this research was
                            important in its own right as in terms of maintaining level of bilateral
                            relations. I said it would be most unfortunate if programs deteriorated
                            for lack of travel funds. I said I could understand why they had waited
                            to see the whole zloty proposal before acting on this element, but hoped
                            that now the whole package was before them they would approve this part
                            immediately. He expressed surprise that it had not already been resolved
                            and said he would take this up himself.</p>

                        <p>In political terms the decision of the Polish Government to agree to the
                            zloty package and to a resumption of the Ford Program after a lapse of
                            four years is an important augury for the future course of U.S.-Polish
                                relations.<note n="3" xml:id="d127fn3">For text of the agreements,
                                signed in Washington on April 10 and 11, 1967, see 19 UST
                                7788.</note> The agreements are a milestone in that they signify a
                            willingness by the Polish Government to permit some movement in our
                            bilateral relations. In fact, the English language program, the key
                            ingredient in the zloty agreement, and the Ford Exchange program open up
                            the possibility for increasing the tempo of our relations. This prospect
                            stands in contrast to the situation that has existed here in the past
                            few years when U.S. efforts took on the character of a holding
                            operation. We were mainly concerned with trying to prevent U.S.-Polish
                            relations from freezing completely, as certain regime elements used
                            Viet-Nam as a convenient excuse to immobilize bilateral relations.</p>
                        <p>For about a year the Polish leadership, with <persName corresp="#p_GW1"
                                >Gomulka</persName> the ultimate decision maker, had been weighing
                            the pros and cons of the elements contained in the zloty package. The
                            decision to go ahead was not an easy one; economic advantages had to be
                            measured against the implications of giving the U.S. an opportunity to
                            expand its influence in Poland. Economic considerations apparently won
                            out. Even though the zloty package provides relatively small financial
                            relief for Poland, the amount was nevertheless significant to a country
                            hard pressed for dollars. Probably more important to the Poles was the
                            precedent they saw created by this agreement. For the first time both
                            countries agreed upon a mutually desirable project to be financed by the
                            U.S. Government-owned zloties which were about to fall due for
                            conversion into dollars. The Poles probably consider this a prelude to
                            finding other mutually attractive projects which would also ease
                            Poland's indebtedness to the U.S.</p>
                        <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0383"/>
                        <p>By agreeing to the zloty package and the Ford Program the Poles gave
                            evidence that Viet-Nam does not completely bar improved bilateral
                            relations. This implies a significant change inasmuch as the Poles have
                            long insisted that Viet-Nam obstructs any significant development of
                            bilateral contacts. It is remotely possible that familiarity with U.S.
                            efforts to end the Viet-Nam war had a favorable impact on Polish
                            decision makers. Undoubtedly, the view that Poland's national interests
                            would be better served by these agreements was the most powerful
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>Inherent in the Polish decision is an apparent willingness of the
                            leadership to modify, or at least restrain, its suspicions and cynicism
                            about U.S. purposes in Poland and to accept the zloty package as an
                            example of a mutually beneficial agreement envisaged and achieved under
                            the President's bridge-building policy. It now behooves us to implement
                            as fully and as quickly as possible the agreements concluded.</p>
                        <p>A possible result of Poland's decision to conclude these recent
                            agreements with the U.S. is the likelihood of an early appointment of a
                            new Polish Ambassador to Poland to succeed the late Ambassador <persName

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Jerzy Michalowski</persName>
                            requested this courtesy call on Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                >Kohler</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                >Kohler</persName> countered <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Michalowski</persName>'s modest observation about the minor role
                            which Poland played in US foreign policy by pointing out that US-Polish
                            relations had been a most significant factor in the formulation of US
                            policy toward Eastern Europe as a whole. He noted specifically the
                            granting of <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> and the Claims
                            Settlement Agreement of 1960.<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2">For text of
                                the Claims Settlement Agreement, signed in Washington on April 16,
                                1960, see 11 UST 1953. Most-favored-nation status was restored on
                                March 26, 1964; see <ref target="#d117fn4">footnote 4, Document
                                    117</ref>.</note> The initiation of the new relationship with
                            Poland at that time was a “test case” between the Executive and the
                            Congress. He said he hoped that the Ambassador would learn here how very
                            real was the separation of powers and how complicated the Executive's
                            relationship with the Congress could be. At the moment these relations
                            were as difficult as he had seen in 36 years of service under both
                            Republican and Democratic administrations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said that he hoped
                            that the time would come when he could help in a change in US policy
                            towards Europe. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>
                            asked for specifics, noting that our policy had been adaptable to
                            European needs and that it appeared that we had reached a stage of
                            stability in Europe. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName>
                            demurred, calling it “an unstabilized balance” which could be upset if
                            further steps were not taken. He noted particularly that the division of
                            Germany was here to stay and that this fact should be recognized.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> asked if the
                            Poles believed the Germans were reconciled to it. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said they were advancing in
                            this direction.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> noted that we
                            had persuaded the West Germans to a commitment in 1954 to renounce the
                            use of force in any change of frontiers.<note n="3" xml:id="d128fn3"
                                >Article 7 of the Convention on Relations Between the Three Powers
                                and the Federal Republic of Germany, as amended, signed in Paris on
                                October 23, 1954. For text, see Documents on Germany, 1945–1970, pp.
                                425–430.</note> To this the Germans have adhered. He believed the
                            aspirations of the German people on both sides would continue to be for
                            unity, that it was folly to recognize the division and give the Germans
                            the feeling of something imposed upon them, as was the case after
                            Versailles. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said that
                            by not bringing about a German reconciliation to the division of their
                            country we were leaving them to expect the assistance of the US to
                            change it. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said
                            we had proved in 1961 and 1962 that we were prepared to fight to prevent
                            any change being made by the other side but that we had also proved that
                            we did not seek to change anyone else's position by force. He said that
                            the major contributions to stability had not come from the Eastern but
                            the Western side. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName>
                            said that particularly in recent years there had been much more proof
                            that the Eastern side was not going to change the <pb n="357"
                                xml:id="pg_357" facs="0385"/>situation by force. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> agreed that this
                            appeared to be so—since 1962. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Michalowski</persName> said that if proof by both sides were
                            furnished that no change was contemplated, the Germans would realize
                            that their interests lay in taking advantage of the existing
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said he did not
                            believe that the Poles appreciated the efforts of the new German
                            Government under Kiesinger and Brandt in the direction of detente. On
                            the contrary, the Eastern European leaders had called a meeting in
                            Warsaw to condemn the Germans for their efforts to establish closer
                            relationships with the East. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Michalowski</persName> said this was to prevent a break in the
                            solidarity of the Warsaw Pact countries and to prevent the weakening of
                            the position of East Germany. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                >Kohler</persName> asked what would happen in East Germany when
                                <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> passes on. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said we should not pay too
                            much attention to personalities. <persName corresp="#p_UW1"
                                >Ulbricht</persName> is not a Mao and even in Mao's case his removal
                            would not change the basic situation. The trend since the death of
                            Stalin has been away from personalities.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> mentioned Polish
                            continuing interest in a European Security Conference. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> asked what kind of a
                            conference he might have in mind. Would this not be directed against the
                            American presence? <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName>
                            insisted that the Poles had never suggested that such a conference
                            should exclude the United States. Any conference of this kind without
                            the participation of the US would be absurd. If such a conference could
                            establish the necessary basis for security, this of course, would make
                            further USA military presence unnecessary. He said he did not hope for
                            spectacular solutions, but that we could move ahead step by step.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> asked after
                            Gomulka, who <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said had
                            been “quiet” of late. Other Polish personalities of Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>'s acquaintance were discussed
                            briefly, such as Ochab and Jaroszewicz. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Michalowski</persName> said he hoped that Jedrychowski (Chairman of
                            the State Planning Commission), whose visit to the US had been called
                            off several years ago because of the “world atmosphere“, would be able
                            to come provided this atmosphere improved.</p>

                            <item>Ambassador called on Vice Foreign Minister Naszkowski Oct 30 to
                                protest comparison of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                                    >Johnson</persName> with Hitler published in Trybuna Ludu Oct
                                27. In reply, Naszkowski defended such comparisons saying that U.S.
                                escalation of Viet-Nam war produced corresponding escalation of
                                Poles' feelings of revulsion and concern for world peace.
                                “Cruelties” of U.S. methods of waging war in Viet-Nam remind us, he
                                said, “of cruelties perpetrated by Nazis against Poles.” When
                                Ambassador rejected validity of such analogies, discussion ensued on
                                Viet-Nam problem which proceeded along usual lines and ended
                                inconclusively.</item>

                                1240). Naszkowski emphasized that exhibit has been postponed, not
                                canceled. We cannot have “great spectacular events” such as U.S.
                                exhibit, he said, during period when Viet-Nam war is causing so much
                                concern. Exhibit has therefore been postponed, he said, in hope that
                                future developments will be more conducive to holding it.</item>

                        <p>The Ambassador and Szewczyk were interested in the outcome of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting at Brussels, particularly
                            that part of the meeting which concerned the <persName corresp="#p_HPC1"
                                >Harmel</persName> Report. They pressed me for details regarding it
                            and for my views as to the significance of the Report. I provided an
                            appropriate summary of the Report's conclusions, noting that one of the
                            areas highlighted by the Report, concerning the future work of the
                            Alliance, had to do with European security and a study of steps which
                            could be taken in the direction of East-West reconciliation.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador remarked that the Belgian Foreign Minister had discussed
                            his ideas on these subjects with Rapacki recently and that the Poles
                            were very much interested in them.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Ambassador's questions, I said that any committee set
                            up by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to consider European
                            security matters would be “open ended” and designed to study the problem
                            and come up with recommendations for possible action; I did not
                            anticipate that there would be any sweeping proposals for over-all
                            negotiations on European security and that it seemed more likely that if
                            anything was possible it would be in the form of small steps which would
                            contribute toward reducing tensions.</p>
                        <p>I thought, for example, that one of the most promising areas for action
                            seemed to be the idea of renunciation of force declarations. The <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> seemed to be quite interested in this
                            idea, but the reaction of some of her neighbors to the East did not seem
                            very forthcoming. The Ambassador agreed that renunciation of force
                            declarations could be useful, although it was important that they also
                            include the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in some way which would
                            not be discriminatory. He was not specific with regard to how the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> should be brought into the renunciation
                            of force package and did not indicate any conditions from the Polish
                            side.</p>
                        <p>I also discussed with the Ambassador and Szewczyk the general question of
                            mutual force reductions in Europe. We covered generally familiar ground
                            and they did not raise any new points.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-Polish Relations</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I talked at some length with Szewczyk on this subject, saying that I
                            regretted the apparent Polish rigidity in this regard. Szewczyk
                            commented <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0388"/>that Poland was
                            certainly not opposed to improving relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> but that it would be impossible to
                            contemplate diplomatic relations so long as the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> proclaimed the theory that it was the only entity
                            qualified to speak for the German people. This was simply unacceptable
                            to Poland, which had relations with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>. Szewczyk passed over rather lightly the Oder-Neisse
                            problem and seemed primarily concerned about the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss>'s claim to be the sole voice of Germany. I noted that
                            Romania did not seem to have similar preoccupations and he acknowledged,
                            somewhat ruefully, that Romania's views on the subject differed from
                            those of Poland.</p>
                        <p>Szewczyk added that, in fact, he did not see much urgency, from the
                            Polish standpoint, in establishing diplomatic relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, since he did not feel this would bring
                            many advantages which Poland did not already enjoy. For example,
                                Polish-<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> trade is increasing every
                            year and cultural exchange and tourism is also on the upgrade.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Viet-Nam</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Ambassador was interested in possible moves by the United States on
                            Viet-Nam in the UN. I said that this question was still under study and
                            I did not know what the outcome would be. He observed that, in his view,
                            any consideration of Viet-Nam in the UN would not produce an outcome
                            favorable to the United States. It was certain, he felt, that the only
                            resolution which could come from UN consideration would be one
                            recommending immediate and indefinite cessation of the bombing.</p>
                        <p>When I mentioned that there might possibly be some attractiveness to
                            considering negotiations in the framework of a renewed Geneva
                            Conference, the Ambassador said that this could only be feasible if
                            agreement had been reached in advance by the US and the principal
                            interested parties. If this were not the case, a reconvened Geneva
                            Conference would simply be a shambles in which the intransigent views of
                            the Chinese would predominate.</p>

                        <p>98888. Following is the gist of an Intelligence Note sent to the
                            Secretary today:</p>
                        <p>All three top Soviet leaders—<persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName>, Kosygin, and <persName corresp="#p_PN1"
                                >Podgorny</persName>—went on an “unofficial,” and clearly unusual,
                            visit to Poland from January 12 to 14.</p>
                        <p>While unannounced Polish-Soviet consultations on international affairs
                            are not unusual, just-completed visit has all the earmarks of urgent
                            Soviet intervention in Polish internal affairs. Rumors from Poland have
                            indicated Poles were planning major Party and Government changes for
                            near future. The most important of the rumored changes would have
                            shifted <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> to specially
                            created post of Party Chairman and made Silesian Party boss Gierek new
                            Party First Secre-tary. Although under reported scheme, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> would have remained in charge of
                            all but internal economic policy—where pressure for younger, more
                            efficient leadership is greatest—such a shift, coming within weeks after
                            ouster of Czech Party boss <persName corresp="#p_NA1"
                            >Novotny</persName>, may have frightened Soviets. They generally dislike
                            change and may particularly not want any more East European party shifts
                            on eve of upcoming Budapest conference of communist parties. In
                            addition, two such shifts within a short space of time in two
                            neighboring communist parties could, in Moscow's and <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>'s view, seriously endanger
                            position of the latter in East Germany. Whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> asked the Soviets to intervene
                            with the Poles, or whether Soviet leaders decided to do so on their own,
                            is less important than likelihood that they did intervene and in
                            collective strength.</p>
                        <p>If we are right that a request for postponement of any change in
                            Gomulka's Party position was principal reason for Soviet leaders' visit
                            to Poland, they probably met with a sympathetic response. Gierek, only
                            clear gainer from the supposedly planned shifts, did not take part in
                            the talks, and all Poles who did probably themselves prefer to delay the
                            changes as long as possible.</p>
                        <p>The inclusion of all three top Soviet leaders strikes one as unusually
                            heavy-handed. The example of 1956, when a much more critical situation
                                <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0390"/>existed and Molotov,
                            Malenkov, Kaganovich, and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> all descended on the Polish capital only to
                            find <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> already virtually
                            installed as Polish Party First Secretary, would seem to have inhibited
                            such an approach. Soviet practice in similar situations in Eastern
                            Europe in recent years, such as the Czechoslovak crisis of
                            December/January when only <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> hurried to Prague, usually has appeared more
                            circumspect. The Soviet leaders, however, have shown a somewhat special
                            regard for Polish-Soviet relations as compared with their relations with
                            other East European states. In addition the impulse to present a united
                            front presumably motivated Soviet regime to send all three leaders.
                            Action also suggests uncertainly in Soviet leadership on how to handle
                            such situations and possibly reflects frustration over how little they
                            were able to influence Czechoslovak shakeup.</p>
                        <p>There is no reason to doubt communiqué that wide range of international
                            questions was discussed and complete identity of views was displayed.
                            Two issues of greatest interest to Poles—German policy and communist
                            unity—are always on agenda when they get together with Soviets, but
                            neither policy toward Germany nor Budapest communist conference
                            scheduled for February seemed to call for additional top-level
                            consultation at this time. In view of Poland's membership in the
                            Cambodian, Laotian, and Vietnamese ICCs, current Southeast Asian issues
                            were probably also discussed, but we do not know of differences of views
                            between Poles and Soviets which would have necessitated top level
                            consultations. Therefore, while we do not want to suggest that the visit
                            was concerned solely with Polish internal affairs and the impact of
                            Czechoslovak developments on the rest of Eastern Europe, we do believe
                            these provided most pressing reasons for it.</p>

                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Parole action may not be necessary—as current refugee provisions will
                            probably enable us to give visas to any Polish Jews who can get out of
                            that country. We have had some Congressional criticism of parole, and
                            would prefer not to use this authority unless necessary. (Parole reduces
                            delay and the need for supporting personal documentation. Technically,
                            it could by-pass legal requirements on health, criminal records,
                            Communist affiliation, etc.—but the State Department's intention is to
                            require security checks and admit only Polish Jews who would otherwise
                            be eligible as refugees.)</p>
                        <p>As drafted, Nick Katzenbach's memorandum would have you authorize parole
                            for “refugees from religious persecution in Poland.” If there were a
                            renewed attack on the Catholic Church, this could apply to Catholics as
                            well as Jews. There is also a theoretical question whether such a parole
                            should apply to Russian Jews or persecuted religious groups elsewhere.
                            In any event this all represents contingency planning.</p>
                        <p>If a parole action were taken, it would, of course, be violently
                            denounced by the Polish Government and perhaps also be criticized by
                            some Polish-Americans. Nevertheless, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName> agrees with the arguments
                            which override these considerations.</p>
                        <p>Essentially, the argument for action now is: <list>
                                <item>—to show the Jewish leadership in America that we are prepared
                                    to move; and</item>
                                <item>—to head off a repetition of the Jews' deeply felt conviction
                                    that the U.S. Government failed to give visas in time to the
                                    desperately persecuted European Jews in the Nazi era.</item>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said that he
                            was returning to Warsaw for consultation and, before going, he wanted to
                            have a general discussion of bilateral relations. He realized that
                            current relations were less than fully satisfactory but thought it
                            important that there be no further deterioration. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> agreed that we seem to be at
                            a low point and said we quite frankly have a problem resulting from the
                            “anti-Zionist” campaign in Poland.<note n="2" xml:id="d133fn2">Following
                                student demonstrations in March 1968, the ultra-nationalist
                                “Partisan” faction of the Polish Communist Party attacked the
                                “Zionism” of certain members of the Polish Government and Party and
                                called for their removal. A purge of Jewish and more liberal Party
                                members followed. An estimated one-half of the small Polish Jewish
                                community applied for visas to Israel. At a July meeting of the
                                Communist Party, First Secretary Gomulka condemned anti-Semitism.
                                However, the Partisan faction remained strong and Gomulka was forced
                                to give ground to its demands at a November Party congress. Gomulka
                                finally put an end to the anti-Zionist campaign in February
                                1969.</note> We are under considerable pressure to make statements
                            or take other actions which might have an unfavorable impact but have so
                            far been able to resist those pressures.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> denied that
                            anti-Semitism was involved in events in Poland and said a “great deal of
                            fuss has been created because 60 or 70 people lost their jobs.” He said
                            that while “unpleasant things happen from time to time,” many of the
                            people fired were not Jewish. He believed an “anti-Polish campaign” had
                            been mounted by Jewish interests which resented Poland's policy in the
                            Mid-East War last June. He feared, however, that the reaction of
                            Congress to these pressures might have an effect on <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment for Polish trade with the
                            United States. He said he was aware that the U.S. Administration had
                            taken a firm stand on this matter in the past and asked if there was
                            likely to be any yielding now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> replied we believe
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> should not be given or taken
                            away on such a basis and we would certainly oppose any Congressional
                            action affecting Poland. At the same time, it would be most helpful if
                            this “anti-Zionist” agitation were to die away.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said there
                            were other fields in which he would like to see more done. He regretted
                            the ending of the IMG program in Poland and thought it was most
                            unfortunate that American books, films and plays were unavailable to
                            Polish audiences because of a lack of foreign exchange. He also noted
                            that an inspection team from the U.S. Department of Agriculture had
                            recently found three Polish slaughter-houses below standard for meat
                            exports to the United States and he wanted to make clear that the Polish
                            Government would move rapidly to improve conditions to have them
                            restored to our list. The Polish Government accepts our reports on them
                            and will comply with our recommendations immediately.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName> said we have
                            other small problems at the moment including Polish requests for us to
                            pay certain shipping costs in hard currency. He hoped that problem would
                            be resolved “before it becomes a cancer.” There is also the question of
                            use of Polish zlotys for research facilities at the Krakow hospital. He
                            thought it should be possible to arrive at some “middle ground” between
                            the Polish position that near-end zlotys must be used and our position
                            that they should come from the far end of the debt repayment schedule.
                            He thought this type of relationship should not be allowed to lapse and
                            noted that construction of these facilities would involve a hard
                            currency input of about $600,000. He was sorry that the outlook for the

                            were on our side and not with Poland.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJA1">Gronouski</persName> (who joined
                            the conversation at this point) said he thought Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> was going back into a most
                            interesting political situation in Warsaw and he wondered what changes
                            were to be expected. He thought Interior Minister Moczar's star was
                            rising now and he would probably occupy a more important Party position
                                <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0394"/>in the near future. For the
                            long term, however, he thought Katowice Party First Secretary Gierek
                            will rise in importance and he may eventually replace Gomulka.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said that
                            although the country is changing, he expects a realignment of the
                            leadership and not a new leadership. He did not believe Gomulka would be
                            replaced in the near future. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJA1"
                                >Gronouski</persName> agreed that Gomulka would probably remain in
                            office but thought he did not have “the kind of control” he had formerly
                            exercised. He said there was a great deal of ferment in Warsaw and had
                            even heard that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Michalowski</persName> might not return from his consultation.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> shrugged
                            and said that would be all right with him since his time here had not
                            been particularly happy.</p>
                        <p>On the way down in the elevator after the meeting, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said he thought it would be
                            most unfortunate if Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJA1"
                                >Gronouski</persName> were not replaced soon.<note n="3"

                            Katzenbach recommending a Presidential statement condemning
                            anti-Semitism in Poland as a substitute for Congressional action
                            withdrawing most favored nation from Poland.</p>
                        <p>Congressman Farbstein will probably offer his amendment to the Foreign
                            Aid Act withdrawing most favored nation from Poland on Thursday. He has
                            not made known his specific language.</p>
                        <p>In the Senate, Dodd last week introduced a sense of the Senate resolution
                            calling of the President to withdraw most favored nation from <pb
                                n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0395"/>Poland until such time as the
                            Polish Government changes its anti-Semitic, anti-student, and
                            anti-intellectual policies.</p>
                        <p>Mandatory withdrawal of most favored nation from Poland now would not be
                            effective foreign policy and would not help the Jews in Poland. I
                            believe Nick's recommendation is well worth a try.</p>

                        <p>Subject: Polish Jews and most favored nation</p>
                        <p>I have learned that Congressman Farbstein intends, within the next few
                            days, to offer an amendment to the foreign aid bill withdrawing most
                            favored nation from Poland. He will argue that Poland no longer deserves
                            preferential tariff treatment because of government-inspired
                            anti-Semitism. Unless we take immediate action, I expect the amendment
                            to pass. This would be unfortunate because: <list>
                                <item>—It could lead the Polish Government to more restrictive
                                    measures against Jews.</item>
                                <item>—It would harm our relations with Poland, and make it
                                    extremely difficult to return most favored nation treatment to
                                    Poland in the future.</item>
                                <item>—It would limit the powers of the President.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have talked to Herman Edelsberg, of B'nai B'rith, who is one of the
                            Jewish leaders encouraging Farbstein to introduce the amendment. He, in
                            turn, has talked to Myer Feldman and other Jewish leaders. Edelsberg
                            tells me that Farbstein is too far down the road now to pull back. But
                            he also says that he and his colleagues can probably prevent passage of
                            the amendment (by avoiding a roll call vote) if he can assure proponents
                            of the measure (including Farbstein) that there will be a strong
                            Presidential statement—within the next several weeks, but after the
                            foreign aid bill has passed—condemning anti-Semitism in Poland.</p>
                        <p>Although I am not sure the amendment can be blocked, I think this tactic
                            is well worth the effort. A Presidential statement would be politically
                            useful at home, and far less harmful to our relations with Poland and to
                            the well-being of Polish Jews than would Congressional action
                            withdrawing most favored nation. If the Jewish leaders cannot prevent
                            passage of the amendment, there will be no need for a Presidential
                            statement.</p>
                        <p>If you agree, I will tell Edelsberg that you are prepared to make a
                            public statement of concern about the plight of Jews in Poland. (You
                            could do this: 1) at a press conference; 2) before a group of Jewish
                            leaders; <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0396"/>or 3) in response to a
                            letter—which we would generate—from a group of Jewish leaders.) I also
                            would call in the Polish Ambassador and explain to him that: <list>
                                <item>—We will try to head off withdrawal of most favored nation,
                                    but the responsibility for the public outcry which this
                                    amendment represents rests wholly on the shoulders of the Polish
                                    Government.</item>
                                <item>—The President has decided that, if we are able to prevent
                                    most favored nation withdrawal, he must issue a strong statement
                                    condemning anti-Semitism in Poland.</item>
                                <item>—If the Polish Government fails to heed our warning, the most
                                    favored nation issue will certainly come up again in the next
                                    session of Congress. At that time there will be no way to
                                    prevent the passage of an amendment which would be in the
                                    interests of neither of us.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Draft Presidential statement follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“For many generations the American and Polish peoples have shared
                                    common aspirations for human rights and dignity. High among
                                    these rights stand freedom of religious faith and freedom from
                                    discrimination based on origin.</p>
                                <p>We know the human suffering that follows the suppression and
                                    violation of these rights.</p>
                                <p>Like millions of other Americans, I have read with deep concern
                                    of recent developments in Poland. These reports make it clear
                                    that many of the relatively few Jews left in Poland now live in
                                    uncertainty and fear. Actions by the Polish Government, whatever
                                    may have been their purpose and motivation, have resulted in the
                                    dismissal from positions not only in government but in
                                    professional life of people of Jewish faith or origin.</p>
                                <p>The world needs no reminder of how anti-Semitism can spread like
                                    a pestilence, leaving horror and tragedy in its wake.</p>
                                <p>The lessons of history remain too vivid and too stark to ever
                                    again permit civilized nations to make innocent men the victims
                                    of political stratagems or maneuvering. Together with my
                                    countrymen, I condemn anti-Semitism wherever it may exist,
                                    whatever form it may take, whatever it may be called. I call on
                                    the Polish Government, and on men of good will everywhere, to
                                    join with me in this condemnation.”<note n="3" xml:id="d134fn3"

                                Czechoslovakia. The result may be Congressional action for

                                        presumably had and will have little opportunity for control
                                        of their own behavior in this case, use of the argument
                                        would run into the Congressional question of why we had not

                                was no consensus on major issues and, in fact, there existed
                                considerable turmoil in party. Speculation was rife that Gomulka
                                might again lose ground to his challengers at November Party
                                Congress. Now, however, those who may have argued within party
                                councils for change in the guard and/or greater autonomy from Moscow
                                might well lie low for time being. Soviets can hardly tolerate at
                                this moment any rocking of Polish boat. Gomulka would not in any
                                case give up without fierce struggle, in which he would presumably
                                be able to count on Soviet support. However, long-term prospects are
                                not so clear; Polish regime has been increasingly exposed as Soviet
                                satellite by willy-nilly identifying itself with Soviet
                                international adventures and miscalculations.</item>

                                and that military has also purged itself of “Zionists” of alleged

                                Polish intelligentsia (cultural and technical) has all along
                                strongly sympathized with liberalizing trends in Czechoslovakia and
                                feels considerable shame and disgust at Polish complicity in

                                came to head during vacation season when students are scattered.
                                What will happen when academic year begins and students are
                                concentrated again in Warsaw, Krakow and elsewhere is difficult to
                                foresee. We cannot discount possibility that there will be attempts
                                to organize protests. <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0401"
                                />However, odds will be strongly against potentially dissident
                                students. Steam may well have gone out of Czechoslovak crisis by
                                time students get together. Regime organs will certainly be more

                                Polish students themselves may be skeptical about utility of protest
                                actions in view of way their protests last March were turned against
                                them and exploited for internal party purposes. Their most militant

                                believe that church will be cautious about expressing its views in
                                public. Church leaders may well conclude that it would not be in

                                internal Czech liberalization process (led, after all, by
                                Communists). Church may well prefer to save its ammunition for
                                issues of more immediate concern to it.</item>

                                of solidarity which have occurred with some regularity have mainly
                                taken the form of letters, greetings and gifts directed towards
                                “heroic” Polish soldiers in the field. Absence of any serious

                                to cancel visits or other joint activities planned for near future
                                to indicate their displeasure. Most dramatic of such actions is

                                Paris. Poland's careful efforts over recent years to cultivate
                                smaller European countries (Scandinavia and Benelux in particular)

                                to have suffered severe setback. Whenever Poles begin picking up

                                which Poles enjoy in West Europe, in other words, has probably run
                                dry, at least temporarily. It had already been significantly reduced
                                by increasing illiberalism of Gomulka regime in recent years,
                                stubborn rigidity on Central European issues, increasingly vocal
                                subservience to Moscow line on all international matters, and above
                                all outbreak of internal anti-Semitism earlier this year. Absence of

                            <item>Conclusions—Unhappy as large sections of Polish public may be over
                                Czechoslovak affair, we are not aware of any significant protest
                                actions and hardly anticipate any. In short run at least, we expect
                                tightening of regime controls. Gomulka will in all likelihood be
                                able to take advantage of current atmosphere to maintain his
                                position in party and possibly win back some lost ground through
                                    <gloss target="#t_PZPR1">PZPR</gloss> Congress in November.
                                However, this immediate prospect does not necessarily correspond to
                                longer range trends.</item>

                            <item>To be sure, Gomulka may use his Czech windfall to pick off his
                                potential rivals and opponents in party leadership and so maintain
                                his predominant position indefinitely. However, younger, less
                                dogmatic, more nationalistic elements of party—those who have been
                                challenging Gomulka's establishment since last March student
                                unrest—do not appear despondent re prospects following Czech
                                invasion. While some are skilled and pragmatic, they do not
                                necessarily sympathize with Czech democracy, liberalism and economic
                                reform. At this stage “the game” is more nihilistic: That of making
                                room nearer top of power structure and occupying it. Today it is
                                Zionists and revisionists who must make room; tomorrow, their
                                protectors (Gomulka establishment) must yield. Moreover, top
                                contenders, Moczar and Gierek, appreciate that under Polish
                                international and domestic conditions only way to climb to top is on
                                Gomulka's back. If Gomulka's long-term authority and respect are
                                debilitated along way by involvement in unpopular affairs—like
                                anti-Zionist campaign, clamp-down on students and intellectuals, and
                                Czech invasion—so much the better.</item>

                            checked with the State Department, and he came by at 3:00 p.m.
                            today.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> opened the
                            conversation by asking what the prospects were of getting back on the
                            track in our bilateral relations. I asked if he had read the President's
                            B'nai B'rith speech, in which the President made clear that a great deal
                            would depend on the actions of the occupying powers in Czechoslovakia
                            from now on.<note n="2" xml:id="d137fn2">For text of President Johnson's

                        <p>I asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> when
                            the Polish Government expected to withdraw its troops. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said that, having
                            paid the price, the Warsaw Pact allies could not withdraw until they
                            were “sure” that their essential objectives would not again be
                            endangered. In talking about the relationship between the Czechs and
                            Moscow, he indicated the Czechs were far from docile or under
                            control.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said his expectation
                            was that the Czechs and Soviets would end up making some sort of
                            agreement which would result in the stationing of two or three Soviet
                            divisions on the western border. He spent some minutes describing how
                            the intervention had become necessary—essentially because the <persName
                                corresp="#p_DA1">Dubcek</persName> regime was allowing
                            counter-revolutionary forces to run rampant and vital Warsaw Pact
                            security interests were at stake. He described Dubcek as honest and a
                            “beautiful” personality, but without the strength to defend Communism
                            that Gomulka had in 1956.</p>
                        <p>I said I could not agree with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Michalowski</persName>'s explanations. If anything seemed clear
                            from the period between January and August, it was that the Czechoslovak
                            Government and people were determined to remain in the Warsaw Pact and
                            to discharge their commitments to it. They had even admitted large
                            numbers of Soviet troops into Czechoslovakia for maneuvers—only to have
                            those troops misused against them. The American Government had been
                            scrupulous in giving <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0404"/>no
                            occasion for anyone to believe we were trying to take advantage of Czech
                            developments. Our relationship to the Czechoslovak Government—a
                            Communist regime committed to the Warsaw Pact—had been extremely
                            reserved—even on bilateral issues such as gold and claims. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> smiled wryly, and said
                            perhaps we didn't want the gold to fall into the hands of the occupying
                            powers.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> readily acknowledged
                            that the American Government's position prior to August 20 had been
                            “correct.” I remarked that the stories of American “green berets” and
                            arms caches were the purest nonsense. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said that this was the sort
                            of thing governments sometimes said in such circumstances, and did not
                            dispute the matter.</p>
                        <p>I remarked that the anti-Semitism in the Polish press and TV did not help
                            matters. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said there
                            had been one speech by Moczar and an article or two, but the policy of
                            Gomulka and the responsible leaders of the government was firmly against
                            such manifestations. When a remark slipped by, Mr. Randal of the <hi
                                rend="italic">New York Times</hi> could be counted on to pick it up.
                            I asked whether the removal of Jewish Poles from government and party
                            offices had altogether ceased. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Michalowski</persName> said he knew of no removals since last
                            spring.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said the Eastern
                            European countries had been willing to work constructively on bilateral
                            matters in spite of the bombing of a socialist ally in Vietnam. We
                            should now show the same constructive attitude with the shoe on the
                            other foot. I said the cases were not analogous. Our bombing of North
                            Vietnam had followed a massive intervention by North Vietnam in the
                            South. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said every
                            action is a reaction to something.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said he had called on
                            Congressman Zablocki yesterday, as well as a number of other
                            Polish-Americans. So far as he could tell, the Polish-American community
                            hoped that cultural and economic relations with Poland would continue. I
                            said this was not my understanding of the reaction of Polish-Americans,
                            and other Americans of Eastern European origin. The White House was
                            getting a lot of mail advocating strong measures, and many Congressmen
                            and other public figures felt the same way. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Michalowski</persName> asked why we didn't respond to a political
                            act politically and not vent our feelings on cultural exchanges which
                            benefited our peoples, or economic measures which would make it
                            difficult to rebuild our relationship later. He particularly mentioned
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>, and said much depended on the
                            vigor of U.S. Government action to save this vital link to Poland's and
                            America's future relationship. If <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            were lost, the Poles would retaliate; and we would be in a downward
                            spiral. I said I was not at all confident what would happen with <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>. I said I thought it did not so much
                            depend on the U.S. Government as on the future course of action of the
                            Polish Government and its Warsaw <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0405"
                            />Pact allies in Czechoslovakia. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Michalowski</persName> said he hoped we would not take a position
                            that a resumption of detente would depend on the abolition of censorship
                            in Czechoslovakia. I said that there seemed to be a range of
                            possibilities—on one hand respect for Czech sovereignty, or at least the
                            non-interference in internal affairs which seemed to be called for in
                            the Moscow Agreements, and on the other a blood bath, police terror, and
                            an occupation regime. I could not make prescriptions, but was merely
                            pointing out that the world—including America—could not fail to respond
                            one way or the other to the future course of events in
                            Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said he felt reassured
                            by Kuznetsov's arrival in Prague. He said he believes things are on the
                            road to normalization, and we will see an improvement in the
                            situation—not a degeneration.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> mentioned that a move
                            to boycott Polish products had so far been narrowly averted. I said I
                            was not at all sure there wouldn't be further efforts by an aroused
                            American public.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Michalowski</persName> said he hoped the
                            American Government would not end up whipping the little countries,
                            while business went on as usual with Moscow. He said the Polish
                            Government had simply been participating in something it had to do. The
                            decisions for the future would be made in Moscow. I said I couldn't help
                            but believe Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> had some
                            influence in Moscow—particularly if reports of divided councils in the
                            Kremlin had any truth to them. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Michalowski</persName> said there had been deep divisions and hard
                            arguments in the Kremlin, and the Polish Government did have a voice,
                            but the basic decision was Moscow's. I asked <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Michalowski</persName> what he had meant by his statement that we
                            should respond politically, and not in the economic and cultural field.
                            He answered: “Oh, perhaps by sending me home and withdrawing Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>—something like
                            that.” He indicated his mission had been one tragedy and disappointment
                            after another. If he had known what was in store, he would never have
                            come.</p>
                        <p>I said I realized that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Michalowski</persName> personally must find the present situation
                            an unhappy one. We parted by exchanging hopes that our next meeting
                            would be in better circumstances. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Michalowski</persName> said he was even then on his way to protest
                            the shootings directed against a Polish ship in Miami.<note n="3"

                            <item>Begin summary. While recognizing Poland's current position as
                                staunch Warsaw Pact ally of USSR ruled by doctrinaire, conservative
                                Communist regime, I believe that evolutionary trends inevitably will
                                continue develop here as in other areas of Eastern Europe. To
                                encourage such trends, to enhance US influence and to promote in
                                long term better relations between Poland and West, we recommend
                                continued, low-visibility, student, professor and technical
                                exchanges; expanded use of PL–480 funds for English language

                                of Polish Communist Party reaffirmed Gomulka's leadership and gave
                                strong support to program emphasizing loyalty to USSR “for better or
                                worse,” and conservative policies relating to internal political and
                                economic life. Re international affairs, regime stresses hostility
                                to <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, necessity of recognizing
                                status quo in Europe, and Soviet preeminence in Eastern Europe.
                                Conservative line and continued leadership of Gomulka are supported
                                by USSR, which wishes stability in Poland, and reflect desire of
                                Polish regime to damp down and absorb internal stresses in wake of
                                “March events” and Czechoslovakia.</item>

                                nationalist themes continue to be voiced although in muted fashion.

                                toward US in Poland resulting from many factors, including numerous
                                family ties with relatives in US, admiration for US as
                                technologically advanced country of democracy and opportunity, and
                                respect for US as leader of non-Communist world. Young people in
                                particular tend regard US with sympathy as most modern state endowed
                                with highest standard of living. At same time, regime propaganda
                                pictures US as imperialist power trying to act as world's policeman
                                (Viet-Nam) and internal conflicts in US are played up. While this
                                propaganda is not in itself very convincing, it is all-pervasive,
                                persistent, and its effectiveness is increasing as cultural, media
                                and other contacts with US are reduced. To counter regime propaganda

                                    Manescu thought perhaps he could take some credit for

                                    unquestionably affected his thinking and Manescu laughingly

                                    foreign trade, which were matters of pressing interest to
                                    Rumania, and that President had not only initiated review of our
                                    trade policy toward Eastern Europe generally but given impetus
                                    to special review policy toward Rumania. I elaborated somewhat
                                    upon his role this regard following Gheorghiu-Dej's talk with
                                    Secretary Freeman and my talk with President last August.<note

                                            relations and that the only major issue between the two
                                            states was the question of exit visas for divided
                                            families. (Ibid.)</note> I stressed as my personal view
                                        that once all consular cases were settled they would
                                        probably not have to wait long for our decision and
                                        therefore what he had just told me this regard was
                                        particularly relevant and would be carefully studied in
                                        Washington. I also emphasized we approached question in each
                                        of three Balkan countries in light of status of our
                                        individual relations with each country and would make
                                        separate decisions accordingly. <persName corresp="#p_MC1"

                                                on reciprocal basis but only 12 percent or so to

                                                than he indicated. In fact I had been under

                                                roughly proportionate and suggested their experts
                                                might take another look at relative proportions.

                            complimentary things about Legation's role. He said that more you get to
                            know us, more you will realize that though we are cautious—“because we
                            have had series of foreign bosses throughout our history we have learned
                            to be”—we are also self-respecting and speak out for ourselves and if we
                            are treated well we respond in kind. I told him that Americans have long
                            been nurtured in very qualities of self-respect and
                            independent-mindedness of which he spoke and it is precisely these
                            qualities we most respect in others and to which we have traditionally

                            Union on many questions but disagrees on others, and she also agrees
                            with Communist China on some but disagrees on others. As I was aware,
                            there had been serious developments affecting unity of socialist camp
                            and Rumania had her own ideas on this important matter. She wished do
                            what she could improve situation and so had decided accept Chinese
                            Communist invitation for discussions. I asked whether invitation was of

                            <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> went on say he must
                            underline that regardless her views on unity of socialist camp, Rumania
                            firmly supports policy peaceful coexistence and wants good relations
                            with all states. In particular Rumania now seeks develop good relations
                            with US and is pleased with how they are going. He said we must realize
                            that Rumania makes her decisions slowly and deliberately, after much
                            careful thought, but once she has done so adheres to them, and that she
                            keeps her promises and one can count on her word. I said I did not
                            question this and was not much surprised by his description of Rumania's
                            position or by decision send delegation to Communist China. Rumanian
                            approach seemed to me to have been expressed clearly enough in Premier
                                <persName corresp="#p_MI1">Maurer</persName>'s article of last
                            November in “Problems of Peace and Socialism,” and Bodnaras had warned

                            of unorthodoxy. Manescu grinned and said Maurer article sums up their
                            approach in nutshell.</p>
                        <p>(<persName corresp="#p_MI1">Maurer</persName>'s article, of course,

                            which could imply interference by USSR; and called on “all” parties in

                            relations with West and looser relations with erstwhile center of

                                    own interest. Rumanian leaders have seized on Moscow's critical
                                    involvement with Peiping to push independent economic policies.
                                    Moreover, in progressive moves, they have directly exploited

                                    fiddle to Soviet tune, through independent statements and

                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Latter point is declaration's central thesis and purpose. In various
                            formulations, it stresses that “diversity” (i.e. polycentrism) among
                            Communist states is natural and essential, that “each party has
                            exclusive right independently to work out its own political line,” and
                            that no party “has privileged position or can impose its line or
                            opinions on other parties.” This bold denial Soviet hegemony is
                            reinforced by declaration's total silence on <gloss target="#t_CPSU1"
                                >CPSU</gloss> vanguard role.</p>
                        <p>Also, declaration considerably sharpens Rumanian stance on earlier key
                            issues, by explicitly stating opposition to <gloss target="#t_CEMA1"
                                >CEMA</gloss> supranationalism, by condemning Moscow and Peiping
                            equally for polemics, and by squarely opposing Soviet call for
                            international conference to “rebuff” Chinese.</p>
                        <p>In light declaration, Rumania's independent economic line should be
                            regarded as part of general effort to place its political as well as
                            economic relations with erstwhile master on new basis. Rumania seems
                            intent on having full direction over its internal affairs as well as
                            right set own foreign policies when its national interests deviate from
                            Moscow's, and on gaining acceptance principle Moscow no longer “Rome” of
                            Communist movement. Economic self-interest and opportunistic
                            exploitation Sino-Soviet dispute are probably main motivating forces
                            this development, but cohesiveness of long-established home-grown
                            Communist leadership doubtless another important factor. There may also
                            be further clarifying elements which not yet fully apparent stemming
                            from past Soviet interference in Rumanian Party affairs.</p>
                        <p>Despite many uncertainties, Legation believes Rumania's nascent national
                            Communism likely to grow. Soviet pressures in response declaration would
                            probably widen gap between Moscow and Bucharest. Other Rumanian trends
                            point toward widening differences.</p>

                        <p>Gaston-Marin began an extended statement by expressing his appreciation
                            for the invitation to the representatives of the Rumanian People's
                            Republic “in order to analyze,” as he put it, “with representatives of
                            the United States new ways of broadening Rumanian-American relations.”
                            He offered special thanks to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                                >Harriman</persName> for his helpfulness in making the visit
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>He went on that the Rumanian leaders had noted with great interest his
                            report of his conversations with Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                                >Harriman</persName> in November,<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">See

                            that it would be possible gradually to develop US-Rumanian relations
                            along constructive lines. Gaston-Marin considered the invitation to make
                            the present visit the first specific response of the new Administration
                            in Washington. He had found that there had been much interest here in
                            developments within the RPR and in Rumanian economic development. He was
                            confident that the American authorities understood what the RPR stood
                            for within the Socialist camp and on the world plane: a policy of
                            national independence and a policy of <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390"
                                facs="0418"/>maintaining a Rumanian position on all problems in
                            accordance with Rumanian national interests.</p>
                        <p>If this was the American understanding of Rumanian policy, as
                            Gaston-Marin was sure it was, then it corresponded with reality.
                            Independence is indeed the foundation of Rumanian national policy. The
                            regime has always been devoted to Rumanian independence and to the
                            development of Rumania in the interests of its own people. This has
                            never been an easy policy to conduct, and there was a time under Stalin
                            when they were badly inhibited. However, they have been taking steady
                            steps in this direction. True independence, nevertheless, cannot be
                            achieved without acquiring an independent economic base. This they are
                            now pursuing, and we can help.</p>
                        <p>Today, the principles of Rumanian policy in relation to both Socialist
                            and Western countries, have been made quite clear. The recent
                            declaration on the part of the authorities of the RPR laid out certain
                            fundamentals: <list>

                                <item>On the major international problem—that of the relationship
                                    between the communist and capitalist world—the RPR stands
                                    squarely with the USSR in favoring peaceful coexistence and the
                                    solution of all international problems through negotiations. But
                                    Rumania does not consider itself a passive participant, merely
                                    ratifying or rejecting positions taken by larger powers. It
                                    considers itself an active member of the world community, able
                                    to present its own points of view, and to argue them to the
                                    extent of its own capabilities. At the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1"
                                        >UNGA</gloss> and at Geneva, for example, the RPR has
                                    recently offered its quiet independent notions on a nuclear free
                                    zone and on the question of broadening international trade.<note

                                    international situation. Rumania has no illusions about the
                                    possibility of eliminating differences within the Socialist
                                    camp, but it hopes to contribute to the possibilities of a

                                <item>In the field of economic relations, the RPR has declared
                                    itself in favor of the principles of non-interference, equality,
                                    mutual respect, and the defense of national sovereignty and
                                    independence. These principles are considered general in their
                                    application. If they are not observed, there can be no political
                                    independence for Rumania. The RPR has established a <pb n="391"

                                    has already learned much from the US. But agriculture,
                                    Gaston-Marin observed, “does not give us a big headache”
                                    (presumably, unlike the USSR and other Eastern European

                                <item>The RPR line for the future is to continue to develop its

                                    Rumanian raw materials intensively so as to raise the Rumanian
                                    standard of living, which still lags behind, not only the U.S.
                                    but also Rumania's European neighbors.</item>

                                <item>Foreign trade is expected to have an important part in
                                    Rumania's economic development. The RPR intends to orient its
                                    economic relations in a diversified way so as to avoid possible
                                    pressure or difficulties. The development of economic relations
                                    with the US is seen in this context. Earlier talks with American
                                    officials have given the Rumanians hope that we can make
                                    progress in this respect.</item>
                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>Gaston-Marin recalled that Governor <persName
                                        corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> had said that the US
                                    had no desire to harm the relations between Rumania and the
                                    Soviet Union. This opinion had been noted approvingly by the
                                    Rumanian leadership. He wishes to say that two sets of realities
                                    must be considered in dealing with Rumania. First, that Rumania
                                    is a Socialist state, has reached a certain level of Socialist
                                    development and cannot turn back, and will continue to pursue
                                    friendly relations with the USSR. Second, that “the great power
                                    to the East” is a very strong power, and “not only a friend of
                                    Rumania but a neighbor.” The US, Gaston-Marin thought,
                                    understood realistically what this meant.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Gaston-Marin went on to say that his group was in Washington to promote
                            expanded trade with the United States. Rumania wishes to import certain
                            industrial items and to further consolidate Rumania's independence. It
                            wished to be granted only the conditions granted to other countries. If
                            trade was to be expanded, export licenses would be needed, of course.
                            Also necessary, would be the possibility of greater Rumanian exports to
                            the US, so as to earn the means of payment of import from the US, and
                            financial credits, such as were available from other Western
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>At this point, Gaston-Marin turned to the question of publicity about
                            Rumania in the United States. It is important, he said, not to make “too
                            much noise” for that “could affect certain people.” It is desirable not
                            to exaggerate events in Rumania. In particular, the less publicity about
                            Rumanian independence at this juncture, the better. Overattention to
                            this in foreign press could harm rather than help our future relations.
                            For the moment, Rumania would like to be placed after Yugoslavia and
                            Poland among the Eastern European countries, in the public eye. “Our
                            aspirations for independence can best be achieved not by noisy and
                            insistent publicity but by a quiet and constructive development in <pb
                                n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0420"/>Rumania's relations with the US
                            and the West.” The important thing, Gaston-Marin concluded, is
                            cooperation with Rumania in the field of economic affairs.</p>
                        <p>This does not mean, he said, that importance is not granted to other
                            bilateral problems. Rumania is ready to find for these problems
                            solutions acceptable to both parties.</p>
                        <p>Gaston-Marin ended his comments which had been based on extensive written
                            notes, by referring to the nuclear power plant included on the list of
                            installations that Rumania had provided us. He said that the RPR had
                            asked the Soviet Union for a nuclear power plant but had been told that
                            delivery would not be possible until after 1970. The Rumanians had had
                            preliminary but inconclusive conversations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> as well. The RPR five-year plan calls for
                            a 500 megawatt nuclear station. Their present power grid is too much
                            dependent on oil and gas, raw materials needed for the chemical
                            industry. Rumania has uranium which it prefers to put into electric
                            power rather than into fissionable material. It would be an important
                            contribution to the power sector of the Rumanian economy if the US could
                            see fit to sell Rumania a nuclear power plant.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> responded that
                            US policy favors a friendly relationship between Rumania and the Soviet
                            Union, as between all states. We have disliked the evidence of
                            dependency within the Eastern European Bloc, and therefore we welcome
                            what we have seen of Rumanian statements and Rumanian actions leading in
                            the direction of national independence. President
                                <persName>Kennedy</persName> had said last June in an important
                            speech that the cause of world peace would be advanced if all countries
                            would stop interfering in other countries.<note n="4" xml:id="d142fn4"
                                >For text of President <persName>Kennedy</persName>'s address in

                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had spoken very
                            favorably of President <persName>Kennedy</persName>'s remarks about
                            non-interference but Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                                >Harriman</persName> observed that he had heard Soviet protestations
                            about non-interference for many years and had found very little
                            substance in them. Perhaps now Soviet relations with small states of
                            Eastern Europe were changing, or the Soviets were allowing greater
                            independ-ence to them. If so, we welcomed the change.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the US-Rumanian relations, Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> made the following points: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The US understands that Rumania has a Socialist system. That
                                    is a matter for the Rumanians. It is no secret, however, that we
                                    believe in an open society, in which people are free to move as
                                    they please and to speak as they please. We understand that some
                                    of the other Eastern European states, including Hungary, have
                                    moved ahead of Rumania in terms of permitting personal freedom.
                                    We think that extension of freedom to the individual cannot fail
                                    but be helpful to international relations.</item>

                                <item>The US is ready to consider ways and means of increasing trade
                                    with Rumania. We will be able to take a broader view than in the
                                    past on export licenses, although no decisions can be taken in
                                    advance of discussion. Credits also can be discussed. We will
                                    need assurances from the Rumanian side about re-exports and
                                    about the end use of certain kinds of American equipment.</item>

                                <item>As far as imports from Rumania are concerned, the <gloss
                                        target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, of course, does not engage in
                                    purchases itself. It can only create the climate and environment
                                    in which trade is possible. The American authorities recognize
                                    that the absence of <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                                    treatment for Rumania can handicap Rumanian trade with the US.
                                    Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said
                                    that it was necessary to be very frank, that there could be no
                                    early grant of <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> to Rumania.
                                    He did not wish to prophesy what might happen next year or in
                                    the future. He did observe that Poland and Yugoslavia now
                                    enjoyed <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> and that the US
                                    action toward these two countries might indicate something of
                                    the direction in which we could go.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>As for press treatment of Rumania, the US Government, of
                                    course, has no control over newspapers and other media. He
                                    suggested that the Rumanians should understand that in a
                                    continental country like the US, public opinion often lags
                                    behind the reality of events. It had taken the American people a
                                    long time, for example, to fully grasp the deep difference
                                    between the US and the Soviet Union. Once public opinion had
                                    come to understand this difference, it was difficult to adjust
                                    to new situations. In these circumstances, we must expect that
                                    statements will be made in the US which are not always happy
                                    ones for our external relations. The Rumanians could be sure in
                                    any event that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had no
                                    wish to complicate relations between the USSR and Rumania and
                                    that authoritative comments to the press would reflect this
                                    basic position.</item>

                                <item>As for Soviet-Communist Chinese relations, Governor <persName
                                        corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said, they are not our
                                    affair. We considered realistic Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                        >Khrushchev</persName>'s frank statement that Soviet policy
                                    is to avoid nuclear war, if at all possible. The Chinese
                                    Communists seem to be less realistic and we can only view this
                                    as unfortunate. We are unhappy over Communist Chinese attitude
                                    over the test ban treaty.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The meeting ended with a brief exchange on trade matters.</p>
                        <p>Gaston-Marin mentioned that because export licenses could not be obtained
                            in the US, Rumania had bought rubber, synthetic fabric, and petroleum
                            installations in Western Europe. In some cases, however, the European
                            producers were less competent in mass production than were Americans and
                            Rumania would like to talk seriously with a range of American firms
                            about possibilities for buying plants and equipment here.</p>
                        <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0422"/>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> repeated what he
                            had said earlier to the effect that we were willing to examine Rumania's
                            requests and to make a positive beginning on improved trade
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed by both sides that further private conversations might be
                            desirable.</p>

                            White House statement when this communiqué is issued, but on balance we
                            do not see much money in it. Will you let me know if you have a
                            different view? Essentially we achieved what we set out to get.

                                <item>To expand Rumanian trade with the United States. Rumania will
                                    be authorized to buy 11 major industrial installations (Tab B)
                                    (out of an original shopping list of 15). They will be licensed
                                    individually and negotiations with private suppliers will be
                                    conducted on a case-by-case basis. For their part, the Rumanians
                                    have given us assurances that U.S. equipment will not be
                                    trans-shipped or re-exported, and technical data of U.S. origin

                        <p>The Rumanians accepted virtually every condition we levied, and this
                            despite the fact that we rejected their request for long-term credits
                            and made clear that the most-favored-nation treatment would not be
                            possible for some time, since this required a major legislative
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>As a collateral matter, the Rumanians promised to talk with
                            representatives of U.S. holders of Rumanian dollar bonds (some issued
                            prior to World War I), to assure them that their interest would be
                            protected. (The Rumanians, however, insist they cannot make specific
                            commitments on claim settlements at this time.)</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the single most significant aspect of these talks was Rumania's
                            determination to succeed in establishing a new and substantial
                            relationship with the U.S.—an important factor in Rumania's drive for
                            independence from Moscow. However, for Rumania's own reasons and
                            political considerations here, there is an awareness on both sides that
                            the pace of these developments cannot be forced. To succeed, there must

                            Bucharest to return to the US on July 9 after three weeks of
                            consultation with his Government. He said this consultation had involved

                            which had been reached between the US and Rumania during the talks held

                            field. He expressed appreciation for the steps the US had taken since

                            agricultural products and the publication by the Department of Commerce
                            on July 14 of a special general licensing procedure for Rumania. He said
                            that these steps reflected a desire on the part of the US to move
                            forward on the agreements reached during the Washington talks.</p>
                        <p>As for the Rumanian side, the Minister said that Rumania would be sending
                            about 10 technical experts to the US to discuss contract details with
                            producers of equipment which Rumania was interested in purchasing from
                            US firms and to arrange for the visit of US businessmen to Rumania to
                            conclude the contracts. It was hoped that the first orders for US
                            equipment could be placed by the beginning of August. The Minister said
                            Rumania was also planning to send a number of expert personnel to the US
                            to seek to expand the market for Rumanian goods in the US.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_BP1">Balaceanu</persName> expressed the
                            hope that he could count on the Secretary's assistance regarding
                            Rumanian interest in purchasing a nuclear power reactor in the US, in
                            arranging credits with the Export-Import Bank where he envisaged the
                            need would be in the neighborhood of $40 million (excluding the nuclear
                            reactor), and on the problem of most-favored-nation treatment for
                            Rumania. He also expressed hope that the Secretary could assist in
                            arranging Commodity Credit Corporation credits for Rumania for the
                            purchase of agricultural commodities. On this point, the Minister noted
                            that Rumanian officials had already talked in general terms with
                            Secretary Freeman and Under Secretary Murphy to explain why Rumania
                            needed such credits. Since Rumanian earnings from exports to the US were
                            limited, a purchase on three-year <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss>
                            credit of commodities which Rumania produced in sufficient quantities to
                            meet its own needs (e.g., edible vegetable oils) would enable Rumania to
                                <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0425"/>expand its exports of such
                            commodities and use the proceeds to purchase other goods from the US. He
                            said that Rumania was very strict in meeting its foreign payments
                            obligations, and such transactions would help it to do so.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded to the Minister's remarks by saying that the US
                            intended to try to move on a constructive basis to carry forward the
                            relations between the two countries. He noted that the President's
                            action regarding Export-Import Bank guarantees and the Commerce
                            Department's action on licensing were examples. As regards the
                            most-favored-nation problem, the Secretary said that this would have to
                            be considered later. The Secretary observed that the Rumanians might
                            encounter certain US firms which would be reluctant to sell products to
                            Rumania even though the Department of Commerce had approved export
                            licenses for a particular transaction. He also noted that the
                            announcement of a major transaction might occasion considerable comment
                            and that any problems arising in this area would have to be faced.
                            Concerning the Minister's idea of purchasing US agricultural commodities
                            under <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> credit to replace exported
                            Rumanian commodities of the same kind, the Secretary said that this type
                            of transaction may present a problem but this could be explored.</p>

                            Rumanian attempt to withdraw from Warsaw Pact at present juncture
                            unlikely, as risks and liabilities would much outweigh potential gains.
                            However if above developments, occurring within short time period,
                            represent more than mere coincidence, they might reflect either (1)
                            Rumanian decision to adopt political line regarding opposition to all
                            military pacts as propaganda conditioner for long term goal of possible
                            disassociation from Warsaw Pact, or (2) response to some as yet
                            unrevealed Soviet pressure on Warsaw Pact matters.</p>
                        <p>Though probably unrelated to foregoing, noteworthy that large conference
                            has been in session at Central Committee Headquarters Building since
                            November 18, judging by number and type of cars parked in special lot

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> proposed that he
                            begin by reviewing bilateral relations. He said he was satisfied that
                            relations have improved and that the spirit in approaching mutual
                            problems is good and equitable. Prospects are good, steps forward are
                            being taken and he is most conscious of the support given by the
                            Department of State and the Secretary personally. Moving to specific
                            subjects, Manescu said his government has granted agreement to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWA1">Crawford</persName>. Meanwhile <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWA1">Crawford</persName> has acted in his own capacity
                            most tactfully and without preconceived ideas. He has assured himself of
                            good conditions of work.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he could verify that <persName corresp="#p_CWA1"
                                >Crawford</persName> is most seriously interested in improving our
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> said another outstanding
                            problem is the consular convention. This would be Rumania's first such
                            agreement with a Western country. The draft has been approved by the
                            Government and it has been handed to <persName corresp="#p_CWA1"
                                >Crawford</persName>. Presumably talks will start this month in
                            Washington. There will no doubt be some discussions, but there are no
                            problems that are insurmountable. There is the possibility of an
                            understanding. The Secretary said we would do our best too.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> said cultural exchange
                            arrangements for 1965–66 are now being achieved which will increase
                            present relations. There has been an important exchange of visits,
                            including a group of American power experts. There is, finally, the
                            problem of economic and trade relations. After the Gaston-Marin mission,
                            Rumanian authorities took steps to see that all agreements arrived at
                            would be effectively implemented.</p>
                        <p>A team is to be sent to the U.S. soon to negotiate a large purchase of
                            cotton. There are also 13 Rumanian specialists surveying the American
                                <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0428"/>market. Their preliminary
                            results show some possibilities. American demand exists for Rumanian
                            products. Some of this demand can be met now, some in the future by
                            adapting production to special American requirements.</p>
                        <p>Certain observations should be made, however, according to <persName
                                corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName>. For instance, the Export-Import
                            Bank is showing some concern that orders for technical installations
                            should not be given as a package, which raises problems of financing. In
                            their view this concern is unfounded. A number of contracts are quite
                            probable, including a catalytic cracking plant and a synthetic rubber
                            plant. These will amount to about $100 million. This is not a great
                            amount in relation to U.S. global figures, but American producers seem
                            interested in selling these installations, and Rumania is interested in
                            buying them. The contracts have not been concluded, however, because
                            such a large amount is a problem for Rumania. Much or all of this could
                            be covered by U.S. sales, but unfortunately the very high tariffs make
                            sales almost impracticable. Where most favored nations pay 17 percent
                            tariffs, Rumania must pay 40 percent.</p>
                        <p>Concluding this subject, Manescu said the Rumanians are counting on
                            increased understanding of this problem and on the fact that the present
                            Administration operates under conditions that give it a freer hand to
                            settle the issue and improve bilateral relations. In any event the
                            existence of so many important problems shows that our relations cover a
                            broad field.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he fully recognized that trade opportunities
                            are limited in the absence of an <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            relationship. Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> may
                            know, however, that both the Executive and the Legislative Branches are
                            actively taking up the problem of the bases of trade with Eastern
                            Europe. Senator Fulbright is making an urgent and detailed study of the
                            subject. The Secretary said he opened the hearings before the Senator's
                            Committee a few months ago.<note n="2" xml:id="d146fn2">For text of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s March 13 statement
                                before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, see Department of
                                State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, March 30, 1964, pp.
                                474–484.</note> The Minister also knows that American businessmen
                            are expressing more interest in changing the situation. Chambers of
                            Commerce have taken up the issue and business groups have gone to
                            Eastern Europe. The State Department is in close touch with these
                            business leaders.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he personally hoped Congress would amend the
                            legislation to permit us to extend <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>,
                            but we cannot say exactly when this will happen. Congress will almost
                            certainly take up the question early in the next session. In view of the
                            need for legislation, there is a timing problem.</p>
                        <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0429"/>
                        <p>There is also another factor involving timing. From the standpoint of the
                            politics of trade, it would help if we could see some progress in <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> negotiations in connection with the
                            Kennedy Round. Talking about tariff reductions across the board is
                            easier politically than individual cases. Meanwhile we will do what we
                            can where opportunities pre-sent themselves. This is what we did last
                            July when we introduced general licensing procedures. We will do our
                            best to handle the problem of the Export-Import Bank within the present
                            legislation. We are prepared to extend some general licenses now that we
                            were not prepared to extend three years ago.</p>
                        <p>There is one field, the Secretary said, where quick improvement is
                            possible—tourism. Americans have not been able to travel easily in
                            Rumania and neighboring countries for 20 years and have accumulated a
                            great backlog of interest in the area. From Rumania's point of view, the
                            promotion of tourism could be very important. From our point of view, as
                            tourism grows we would hope the Rumanians would earmark a part of their
                            tourist proceeds to permit Rumanian tourists to come to the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would look into the Export-Import Bank problem when
                            he returned to Washington. He said he was somewhat optimistic about the
                            development of economic relations, although he recognized the importance
                            of the <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> problem. We are both victims
                            of history in this respect, but we will try to reverse it if we can. It
                            would be useful if we could get certain Senators and Congressmen to
                            visit Rumania next year. On this question <persName corresp="#p_MC1"
                                >Manescu</persName> said the Secretary would have his entire
                            support.</p>

                                <item>The Rumanians have given <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss>
                                    trade data and have agreed to give debt servicing data, provided

                                    <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> has proposed that the
                                    contracts be financed with 15% cash payment and 85% on credit.
                                    Of the credit,<gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> would
                                    guarantee 85% and the balance was to have been assumed by the
                                    suppliers. <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> would thus
                                    guarantee 72–1/4% of the contracts. The suppliers (Firestone and
                                    Universal Oil Products) are unwilling to share any of the credit
                                    risk. Their position is strengthened by the fact that they
                                    presently have no competition for the contracts. The 72–1/4%
                                    which <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> is prepared to

                                    Rumanians are discussing various additional, large-scale
                                    equipment purchases with US suppliers, the value of which might
                                    be in the neighborhood of $70 to $90 million. This includes a
                                    $20 million fertilizer plant. The question is how far <gloss

                                    additional projects. The fertilizer plant might be feasible, but
                                    anything more would be very questionable.</item>

                        <p>The Under Secretary commented that we were seeking in the rubber and
                            cracking plant transaction to establish a commercial relationship with
                            the Rumanians which we hope would develop further. Our purpose is
                            principally political—to help peel Rumania off from the Soviet Bloc. The
                            Rumanians have shown a willingness to give us financial information
                            which they have not given to others, and we should be prepared to ease
                            the Rumanians gradually toward a normal economic relationship with us.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said he thought we
                            should not at this time go much over $100 million without Rumania having
                            more exports to the US.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> would seek the
                            maximum balance-of-payments information from the Rumanians but would not
                            insist on invisible data as a condition for concluding a deal on the
                            rubber and cracking plants. It would also consider an application for
                            credit guarantees on the fertilizer plant, but would press the Rumanians
                            harder for information on invisibles before approving this
                                transaction.<gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> would hold to its
                            position of guaranteeing a maximum of 72–1/4% of the credit. Mr. Linder
                            was confident this would present no difficulty, since the Rumanians were
                            getting financed or guaranteed somewhat smaller percentages of the total
                            cost in other Western countries. If the rubber, cracking and fertilizer
                            plant transactions are concluded, <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss>
                            would not consider further applications for guarantees for, say, a
                            period of 18 months.<note n="2" xml:id="d148fn2">In a memorandum to

                            Embassy finds Iacobescu's comments most pertinent and believes he is<pb
                                n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0433"/>on the level. Though possibly
                            somewhat over-dramatized for effect, his statements closely reflect
                            sentiments shared in official circles here. No question that there is
                            very real concern within Rumanian Government how long it can continue
                            get away with independent policies in face of possibly tightening Soviet
                            pressures and that government is actively seeking extensive reassurance
                            in West particularly through strengthening economic and other ties with
                            US. Also clear this one of major reasons why Rumanians attach such
                            importance to successful outcome current financial and industrial talks
                            in US. As Rumanian officials have recently indicated to us, eyes not
                            only of Rumanian Government but of entire Communist bloc are now
                            directed toward our response in these matters to test whether we really
                            mean business in applying policy of bridge-building and differentiated
                            approaches in Eastern Europe. Moreover effectiveness of RPRs continuing
                            independent policies will be judged in no small measure in terms of our
                            reaction.</p>
                        <p>Iacobescu's comments conform to recently established Rumanian pattern
                            more candid discussions with Western delegations in major international
                            organizations as well as growing effort strengthen relations with such
                            organizations including some in which RPR not necessarily member state
                            (i.e. <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"

                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>). In Embassy's view attempts by
                            Rumanians to continue develop own course demand thoughtful and positive
                            response to such approaches by all US agencies along lines indicated
                            Department's CA–9208. Iacobescu would seem be contact well worth
                            pursuing and same would apply to Valentin Lipatti, new Rumanian
                            Permanent Representative to UNESCO.</p>

                            State had recommended approval and appealed to the ECRB. He,
                            accordingly, asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            to state his position.</p>
                        <p>Deputy Secretary Vance interjected at this point that he and Secretary

                            agree with the position taken by the Defense representatives at the

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> began by observing

                            embargo items. Accordingly, the question is whether the U.S. should be

                                >COCOM</gloss> countries.</p>
                        <p>He does not believe it is in our national interest to be so restrictive

                        </p>
                        <p>This is the kind of trend that was very noticeable at one period in
                            Yugoslavia, and in another period in Poland. We should be ready to
                            respond favorably to that trend here as we did in the cases of
                            Yugoslavia and Poland. On this basis, it is in our interest to take a
                            forthcoming attitude on trade relations with Rumania.</p>
                        <p>If we seem to close the door to them in areas like this where we have
                            discretion—even before any Congressional problems have to be faced on
                            such necessarily legislative matters as <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> treatment—then we will be injecting an unrequired
                            negative element. That would not be in our interest, especially as the
                            same kinds of items, even though with less sophistication, are
                            available. Thus it is our interest to license these cases as a means of
                            keeping the doors open, of stimulating their favorable responses toward
                            our policies, and of encouraging normal relations between our two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Connor observed that foreign deep drilling equipment is not of
                            the same kind as ours; that our technicians have found ours to be vastly
                            superior.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Udall said that the U.S. drilling equipment is substantially
                            better in quality than that made in other countries. We would be giving
                            Rumania here something not available to them elsewhere.</p>

                        <p>Secretary Connor asked Mr. Cline to inform the members regarding
                            Rumania's shipping of petroleum products to North Viet Nam, Communist
                            China, and Cuba.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cline replied, as follows:</p>
                        <p>In 1963, Rumania supplied somewhat less than 20% of North Viet Nam's
                            petroleum products, with the USSR providing the balance. In 1964, the
                            Rumanian share was 17%. For 1965, we have only one report to date, 500
                            tons of lubricants in one February shipment. The Rumanian shipments were
                            primarily of motor and diesel fuels, but there is no evidence of
                            kerosene or jet fuels. It was shipped by sea to North Viet Nam. There is
                            no evidence the Rumanian shipments have ceased.</p>
                        <p>Some free world countries do supply North Viet Nam substantial amounts of
                            other kinds of goods, but no free world country is known to be supplying
                            petroleum products to North Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>Rumania also shipped substantial amounts of petroleum products to
                            Communist China, including 160,000 tons in 1964. This was primarily
                            motor gas, kerosene, lubricants, and jet fuel.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d150fn3">At the meeting Mr. Cline inadvertently said there
                                was a “relatively small amount of jet fuel.” This is now corrected
                                as the amount was fairly substantial. [Footnote in the source
                                text.]</note> The only free world shipments of petroleum to
                            Communist China were by Iran in 1964.</p>
                        <p>Rumania ships very little petroleum products to Cuba, but did send Cuba
                            substantial amounts of oil drilling equipment, about $2 million by the
                            end of 1964. Oil exploration work is proceeding there, but not with much
                            success. the Rumanian equipment is for drilling to about 3,500
                            meters.</p>
                        <p>Deputy Secretary Vance said the key issue to him is whether Rumania has
                            promised not to copy or reexport our equipment.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that Rumania
                            did so promise us in the negotiations last summer.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Connor observed that the Rumanian promises do not appear to go
                            all the way. Rumania has promised the U.S. products, designs and
                            technology will not be transshipped or reexported, and that U.S.
                            products will not be copied. However, Rumania's promise does not bar it
                            from using our designs and technology to make products and sell them
                            abroad. Also Rumania can incorporate into its own oil drilling equipment
                            advanced features of U.S. equipment without actually copying same, and
                            then sell their equipment anywhere.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Udall added that U.S. oil industry representatives believe that
                            the USSR is very much in need of advanced deep drilling equipment and
                            that Rumania could not hold our equipment and technology away from the
                            USSR, even if Rumania desired to live up to its promise to us. <pb
                                n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0437"/>The U.S. oil industry is very
                            much concerned about the effects of increased free world sales of
                            Rumanian and Soviet petroleum products and takes a hard line against our
                            supplying them with our best technology and equipment. Accordingly, he
                            could not support an approval decision in these cases against the
                            objections of the U.S. oil industry unless he could tell them that the
                            Rumanian assurances can safely be relied on.</p>
                        <p>The members at this point generally discussed the question of how long it
                            would take Rumania to produce and export equipment based on copying or
                            adopting ideas from our equipment. Deputy Secretary Vance thought it
                            would take them 2 or 3 years, by which time we would have even better
                            equipment in production. Mr. Hockersmith said that the length of time
                            would vary, depending on the particular kind of equipment. Secretary
                            Udall agreed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cline, in response to a question, said that the equipment the
                            Rumanians are seeking from us is more advanced than anything the USSR
                            and other bloc countries presently have. He also noted that in 1964
                            Rumania signed a new agreement with the USSR to exchange technical
                            know-how in oil, chemical and other industrial fields. Rumania's 1965
                            Trade Agreement with Communist China includes exports of petroleum
                            equipment.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Connor asked whether Rumania could or would attempt to hold
                            U.S. technology and products against demands by the USSR, to the extent
                            of resisting force.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that the
                            Rumanians have been behaving toward the USSR generally as though they
                            are sure the time is past in which a country like Hungary would be held
                            by Russian force. We have good reason to believe the Rumanians consider
                            it is in their national interest to adhere to their assurances to us.
                            After all, they want from us much more than the items involved in these
                            cases. However, it is, of course, possible that the USSR could go in
                            openly or otherwise and try to get our technology and equipment, and it
                            could not be guaranteed that Rumania would resist or be successful in
                            such effort.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> went on to say that
                            Rumania is not taking an active role in carrying out <gloss
                                target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss> agreements.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from Secretary Connor, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agreed that none of the items in
                            question was on the Shopping List of last summer.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d150fn4">See <ref target="#d142">Documents 142</ref>-<ref
                                    target="#d144">144</ref>.</note> However, he said, we expected
                            they would be adding other things from time to time.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Udall asked how, if these cases were approved, we could
                            describe to Rumania the meaning of our approval from a diplomatic <pb
                                n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0438"/>standpoint. Could we say that
                            you are on trial; that more will be approved, if you show you are
                            trustworthy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that we have
                            reason to trust Rumania already. They are the most independent of all
                            Communist countries relative to <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss>
                            requirements, and they are most interested in increasing their trade
                            with the West. However, he agreed that we could explain to Rumania that
                            we consider these items important and are counting on their assurances
                            being kept. He reiterated that Rumania has an interest in having much
                            larger trade with us than in just these items.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Connor observed that it is hard to call Rumania's desire to buy
                            these items “trade”. The variety of items is so small, and the
                            quantities are limited to a few. This suggests they are only interested
                            in samples to acquire our technology. If we approve these cases, we will
                            be helping them to update their oil industry with the best U.S.
                            technology, and at a cheap price.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                                >Rusk</persName>, Secretary Connor agreed that we license this same
                            equipment for use in oil fields throughout the free world. However, he
                            noted that in most of those areas the companies engaged in the
                            exploration and drilling are affiliated with U.S. interests.</p>
                        <p>In response to Secretary Connor's request for his views, Secretary Udall
                            said that the U.S. petroleum industry and officials of his department
                            take a hard line on selling Rumania and other bloc countries our
                            advanced technology and advanced equipment containing extractable
                            technology. “Maybe I'm softer“, he said, “but I tend, on the basis of
                            the discussion so far, to defer to State, if State feels so strongly
                            about these cases for foreign policy reasons.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary Connor replied that this is not his attitude. He would, before
                            favoring approval, wish to know what effects our approval would have on
                            Rumania's oil industry, as well as its relations with both the Soviet
                            bloc and the West. What course would our equipment enable Rumania to
                            pursue? What avenues of independence would it open for Rumania that it
                            presently does not have? “I see arguments on both sides“, he said. “I
                            would not vote yea with enthusiasm as I presently have reservations
                            about Rumania's intentions.”</p>
                        <p>Deputy Secretary Vance then expressed the views of his department. He
                            said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and
                            he generally favor sales unless there are strong reasons against. On the
                            drilling equipment he saw no strong reason for denial and would vote
                            yea. The same for the catalyst material and anti-knock compound. As to
                            the catalyst technology he said he was still uncertain, believing that a
                            few more questions needed to be answered.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then expressed his
                            Department's views. He said that he would not have recommended approval
                            of these cases two years ago, <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0439"
                            />but so much has happened in Rumania in the last year regarding its
                            relations with the USSR and the West. Therefore he would now “nudge the
                            Rumanian development along” by approving these cases since they are
                            among the several kinds of items Rumania is looking for from us.</p>
                        <p>Responding to a question about whether <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> is one of the items that Rumania wants from us, and
                            whether we would ask Congress to allow <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> to be given to Rumania if she pays her debts to us,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said he hoped the
                            U.S. would be able to give <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment
                            to imports from particular countries after we settle with them whatever
                            has to be settled.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Connor then said that he was opposed to approving the oil field
                            equipment and the catalyst technology. He also did not like the
                            implications regarding possible use by North Viet Nam of Rumanian
                            gasoline that might be upgraded with the U.S. anti-knock compound, but
                            he would approve it in a spirit of compromise, to give Rumania some of
                            the items they have ordered. He would also approve the catalyst
                            material.</p>
                        <p>Deputy Secretary Vance asked about the importance of the U.S. catalyst
                            technology. Mr. Wyman explained that Mr. Englehart had admitted to him
                            that the U.S. catalyst material is superior to that available from
                            France and other countries, and that the U.S. technology regarding its
                            use is the best. Mr. Englehart was really not interested in selling
                            Rumania the technology, but only the material. He had filed the
                            application for the technology only because his competitor had applied
                            to sell the technology too.</p>
                        <p>At this point there was a general discussion of the catalyst use
                            technology and the reason for its importance, and regarding the
                            technology extractable from the petroleum drilling equipment.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked Secretary
                            Connor whether his indicated opposition to approval of the drilling
                            equipment and the catalyst technology applied only to Rumania, or
                            extended to any country that might be a competitor of the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Connor replied that he drew a distinction between free world
                            and Soviet bloc competitors of the U.S., noting that this distinction is
                            called for by Section 3(a) of the Export Control Act. Regarding Rumania,
                            he asked Mr. Cline for pertinent figures and then emphasized that
                            Rumania exports half the petroleum products it produces, and over half
                            of that goes to other Soviet bloc countries. Next to the USSR, Rumania
                            is the largest supplier of oil products to the bloc, with the USSR
                            receiving most of Rumania's exports to the bloc.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Connor asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                                >Rusk</persName> whether we would supply oil directly to North Viet
                            Nam. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that
                            we have no trade with North Viet Nam, but that if we were to take
                            sanctions against Rumania because she sells oil to North Viet Nam we
                            would have to do <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0440"/>the same
                            regarding a number of free world countries that also ship to North Viet
                            Nam.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Connor asked Mr. Cline whether the free world countries are
                            known to be shipping oil or other militarily important materials to
                            North Viet Nam. Mr. Cline replied that there is no evidence of free
                            world shipments of petroleum products or commodities which would make a
                            direct contribution to the military.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Udall read from a report showing that Rumania's sales of oil to
                            the free world are important to enable Rumania to earn the funds with
                            which to buy machines and other items from the West. He suggested that
                            from this standpoint helping Rumania increase its sales of oil to the
                            West is beneficial to our interests.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that the U.S.
                            has since 1945 been trying to get the Soviet bloc to learn to live
                            peacefully with the West. The late Secretary Dulles in 1953–54 had
                            dreamed of the day when we would have the kind of opportunity we have
                            today to encourage a bloc country like Rumania to loosen its ties to the
                            USSR and make friendly ties with us. If we give up the opportunity that
                            approval of these cases gives us, we may lose the chance to help break
                            the tight control of the USSR over the bloc countries, and may thus
                            impair the prospects for long-term peaceful coexistence. He noted that
                            other free world countries like West Germany are moving now to improve
                            their relations with the various East European Communist countries.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Connor said he still did not believe that as the official
                            charged with responsibility for administering the Export Control Act he
                            could properly approve the catalyst technology and drilling equipment
                            cases. However, he said, “I can, of course, be overruled by the
                            President.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that he
                            would ask the President to consider this matter.</p>
                        <p>Deputy Secretary Vance asked whether the French would be likely to sell
                            their catalyst technology and catalyst to Rumania if we refuse to sell
                            our technology along with the catalyst material. Secretary Connor
                            replied that this would not necessarily occur.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to the question of what limits, if any,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> would put on
                            exports to Rumania. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            indicated that, with possibly some exceptions, he would approve
                            everything not on the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> embargo
                            list. Secretary Connor observed that he could not think of anything not
                            on the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> list, but which we
                            control, which could be more important than advanced equipment and
                            technology for oil exploration and production.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Connor then concluded the discussion by saying he would approve
                            the catalyst material case (Englehart) and the Ethyl anti-knock <pb
                                n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0441"/>case, and would deny the
                            catalyst technology and petroleum exploration equipment cases.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Thau asked if the cases to be approved could be acted on by BIC
                            without waiting the Presidential review of the other cases. Secretary
                            Connor approved and the other members concurred.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hockersmith called attention to a recent application by Universal Oil
                            Products Co. (Case No. 65378) to sell a quantity of catalyst material to
                            Rumania. He asked if this could also be approved. Secretary Connor
                            agreed and the others concurred.</p>
                        <p>(The meeting adjourned at 5:10 p.m.)</p>
                        <p>The following day Secretary Connor determined to hold up approval of the
                            anti-knock case for Presidential consideration along with the others
                            because of the Viet Nam possibilities. This change was communicated
                            informally to the interested departments.</p>

                                >On April 16, representatives of Firestone informed U.S. officials
                                that they would withdraw from negotiations with the Romanian
                                Government as a result of a well-organized U.S. campaign against
                                sales to Romania. A memorandum of this conversation is ibid.</note>
                            it is more urgent now than before that we take a square look at the
                            outstanding licenses for the Rumanian oil industry which have been
                            blocked by the Department of Commerce. It is increasingly clear that
                            neither the Secretary of Commerce nor Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> have looked carefully at the
                            problems of Rumania to examine the characteristics which distinguish it
                            from other Communist countries. (I have been assured that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>'s approved <pb n="414"
                                xml:id="pg_414" facs="0442"/>script for his interview with Firestone
                            made the point of national interest far more strongly than Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> actually did and erected hurdles
                            for Firestone which <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> did not
                            use.)</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that this problem is worth a full-scale debate so that all
                            parties concerned understand what this government's policy is and the
                            operating guidelines can be set accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The Firestone deal is over. (I understand Firestone has issued a
                            statement this afternoon in Akron, Ohio, to that effect.) But we may be
                            able to save some of the political pieces. It is not clear at this
                            juncture just how the Rumanians read the cancellation action. Bucharest
                            sent in a cable this morning indicating that Vietnam has left the pages
                            of the Rumanian papers—which could indicate that the Rumanians consider
                            the cancellation a reaction to their position on Vietnam. If that is so,
                            one of the ways we might save some of the political gains of the last
                            months is to move ahead with the pending licenses, demonstrating that
                            there is still a special policy toward Rumania, but it requires a
                            Rumanian quid for our quo. This would also give us some turn-around time
                            during which we might look around for alternative sources to fill the
                            gap left by Firestone.</p>
                        <p>But as I indicated above, in the long term it is important to bring key
                            members of the government (i.e., the Secretary of Commerce and the Under
                            Secretary of State for Economic Affairs) into agreement with what has
                            generally been understood to be this government's policy. And to be
                            useful this has to be done immediately—if possible before this week is
                            out.</p>

                                    with strong overtones of criticism of Soviet policies toward
                                    Romania all the way back to early 1920s. Outburst may well have

                                    broke new ground by attacking Comintern and implicitly Soviet
                                    efforts to dictate Romanian Communist policy as far back as
                                    Lenin. In no less than nine places he indirectly refers to
                                    Bessarabian issue. While Romania obviously has no hopes for
                                    return Bessarabia, raising issue presumably designed illustrate

                                    this charge must appear to Moscow as directed against Warsaw

                        <p>The Secretary said that Assistant Secretary Solomon would be in Europe
                            next week and that he might be able to pay a brief, informal visit <pb
                                n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0445"/>to Romania to talk with trade
                            representatives if the Foreign Minister thought this would be helpful.
                            The Secretary said that he raised this matter since it was his hope that
                            early in 1967 Congress will take up the East-West Trade Bill. Mr.
                            Solomon will be one of the principal witnesses for the Administration,
                            and it would be useful for him in talking with Congress if he had a
                            chance to get the feel of the situation in Romania.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister responded that of course this could be arranged, and
                            he wished all success to Mr. Solomon in connection with the Trade
                            Bill.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said this question of Mr. Solomon's visit led into a very
                            important part of our bilateral relations, namely, that of trade. He
                            understood that an important delegation of American industrialists would
                            be coming to Romania soon. Also, talks have been held with Phillips
                            Petroleum about obtaining a license for some of their processes. This
                            showed that there was a possibility of purchasing licenses and equipment
                            in the field of oil processing. The trouble started, however, with
                            Romanian exports.</p>
                        <p>In general, the Foreign Minister said, we are in a sad situation
                            concerning trade. He asked that what he had to say be conveyed to the
                            highest level of the American Government. Before he left Bucharest, he
                            had talked with Secretary-General <persName corresp="#p_CN1"
                                >Ceausescu</persName>, who had said with regard to bilateral
                            relations with the US, that Romania wished for normal relations with the
                            US. Now, however, things were not going as smoothly as they should; the
                            fact that Romania is unable to buy certain things it would like or to
                            sell some products it wished to export shows that there are
                            difficulties. All of this takes on a certain aspect of political
                            pressure.</p>
                        <p>The Minister recalled the Firestone deal which had almost been completed
                            when rightist circles intervened and caused their arrangements to be
                            canceled. This was hard to understand. The Minister knew that the
                            Administration in the US was not free to do as it would like and that
                            Congress is a problem. Nevertheless, the Minister is dealing with the
                            Secretary and not with Congress. He had the impression that we might
                            want the Romanians to change their regime, and if that happened, things
                            would be easier.</p>
                        <p>This is not the way to go about matters, however, the Minister said.
                            Transactions should be considered strictly from the commercial point of
                            view. In general, he thought the situation was rather strange. We seemed
                            to be able to discuss various things in a constructive way and to
                            understand each other's point of view, but still we were unable to move
                            forward on trade. The Minister referred to <persName corresp="#p_CN1"
                                >Ceausescu</persName>'s speech in which he had said that it is not
                            any fault of Romania that relations with the US do not proceed as they
                            should.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded that the US Constitution was very complicated. It
                            was drawn up by men who did not wish to give any element in <pb n="418"
                                xml:id="pg_418" facs="0446"/>the Government supreme power. The
                            President does not control Congress, even when his party has a majority.
                            Also, the Congress has a special responsibility in the field of foreign
                            trade which is provided for in the Constitution. These are problems for
                            the US to resolve, not the Romanians. The President hopes to resolve
                            them and to make a good start this coming year. The Secretary said we
                            have been told by key Congressional leaders that they will not take
                            action on the Trade Bill until after the November elections. We don't
                            agree with this position, but we must face facts.</p>
                        <p>A second problem in the development of our trade relations, the Secretary
                            said, was that we cannot give directions to private industry or labor
                            unions. We deeply regretted what happened in the Firestone case. We had
                            done our best to prevent this, but Firestone, of course, was free to do
                            what it wanted. It turned out they were overly timid.</p>
                        <p>All of these things created complications in our trade relations.
                            However, problems which arise between systems of private enterprise and
                            systems of socialism can be resolved, although this may take time. The
                            Secretary noted that Romania's best customer was the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, which is a private enterprise
                            system.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary wondered what he, the President, or Assistant Secretary
                            Solomon could do in the present circumstances before approval of the
                            East-West Trade Bill. We can try to remove obstructions subject to
                            administrative action, and we can encourage US businessmen to trade with
                            Eastern Europe. We have done this. We can also advise Romania concerning
                            opportunities in our markets for sale of its products. Frankly speaking,
                            however, in the absence of most-favored-nation treatment, our tariff
                            regulations are very severe.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> said he understood these
                            problems, which he has known about for a long time. He wished to note,
                            however, that a solution should not be sought by trying to persuade the
                            Romanians to do things like the US or by the Romanians attempting to
                            change the outlook of the United States to meet their views. While these
                            may be desires on the part of both sides, they are Utopian; only life
                            will show the way.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that we should put these ideological matters “in
                            the corner.”</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister continued that, when Mr. Solomon comes to Bucharest,
                            he will find people who are favorable toward trading with the US. Of
                            course, trade cannot be at a very high level. The general outlook for
                            trade between our two countries was that it will not be extraordinary in
                            size; however, it will play a role in our relations. It is a question of
                            living together and of establishing a basis on which to build. He
                            predicted that Mr. Solomon would see that Romania wants better
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary confirmed that we on our side are interested in better
                            relations with Romania and do not wish to quarrel about ideological <pb
                                n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0447"/>matters. Of course there are
                            things about which we disagree, but there is no government in the world
                            with which we agree on everything. He also wished to say that we are not
                            indifferent to small amounts of trade. The Secretary noted that he had
                            gone to Germany to speak to the Chancellor personally about buying
                            American chickens. We are interested in these things, whatever the size
                            of the deal—$100,000, $100 million, or $100 billion. We do not treat
                            these matters lightly. The Secretary had noted that our exports to
                            Romania had increased rapidly in recent times, whereas the imports from
                            Romania had not gone up so fast. He was concerned about this and felt we
                            should find a way to improve the situation. Mr. Solomon noted that our
                            exports to Romania in the last six months amounted to $11 million—a
                            result of our liberalized licensing policy.</p>
                        <p>When the Foreign Minister asked how Romania could pay for imports from
                            the US, the Secretary said that this could be done by tourism in part.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> replied that US
                            tourists in Romania are very stingy. Most of them, he said, are of
                            Romanian origin and stay with their relatives in Romania rather than in
                            hotels.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> said that the
                            Minister should put out of his head any idea that the Administration of
                            the US or officials responsible for foreign policy have any concept that
                            trade should be used as pressure in deciding differences of opinion
                            between countries. He would not be honest if he said that there were no
                            Congressmen who felt this way, but for the Administration, there was
                            definitely no idea of political pressure or of imposing ideological
                            conditions on trade.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the world food crisis, the Secretary asked if Romania had a
                            good harvest this year. <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName>
                            answered affirmatively, saying there had been a good wheat crop and that
                            corn and meat was also good.</p>
                        <p>In response to questions, the Minister said that Romania's principal
                            exports are oil, wood, furniture, plywood, chemical products and
                            agricultural products, especially corn. Exports to Germany consisted
                            largely of agricultural products, furniture and oil. As far as Romania's
                            balance of payments is concerned, <persName corresp="#p_MC1"
                                >Manescu</persName> said that it is more or less in equilibrium.</p>

                            and to make friendly gestures to me.</p>
                        <p>2. About two hours after departure of train and as I was preparing to
                            retire Chief of Protocol <gloss target="#t_MFA1">MFA</gloss> knocked on
                            my compartment door around 10 p.m. and announced President Stoica would
                            like to see me in his private car. There I found him with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName>, the Secretary of the State
                            Council, Geamanu, and interpreter Celac who usually accompanies
                                <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> on his annual visit to
                            UN. As far as I am aware I was the only chief of mission during entire
                            trip to be accorded this type of private meeting. After some social
                            conversation talk inevitably turned to subjects our bilateral relations
                            and Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> took initiative by
                            asking whether Americans properly understood Romanian policy. I assured
                            him that U.S. Government well informed on Romanian policies and actions
                            taken by Romanian Government in support its independence during past
                            years though there were individual members of Congress and segments of
                            American people who were probably not so well informed. I referred in
                            this connection to pessimistic reports that Congress might refuse to
                            pass the administration's East-West Trade Bill this session thus
                            continuing to deny Romanian trade <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            treatment. Stoica brushed this aside as something which would be solved
                            in future; important thing was for U.S. to understand that Romania
                            determined to follow independent course in its own national
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> then began mildly
                            complaining that I had not come to see him frequently, that while he
                            profited by his discussion with “his friend” Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on occasions his visits to U.S., he
                            never had had any follow up from me and he cited in particular the
                            problem of Vietnam. He asked how many times I had taken initiative to
                            call on high officials of <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0449"

                            British Ambassador in such a way that I can only assume he was implying
                            that Romanians disappointed that I had never asked to call on <persName

                            accurate. He specifically requested I convey this information to
                            Washington. At one point during this dialogue Stoica intervened to
                            emphasize that I should note Romania did not seek to blame either party
                            for Vietnam situation; they were interested only in peaceful settlement
                            of problem. Romanians realized U.S. prestige involved but Vietnamese had
                            problem with “face” too. At another point both Stoica and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> responded in negative to my
                            question whether import of what they telling me meant Romania offering
                            to mediate. Conversation ended with Stoica and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> reiterating Romanian desire to
                            have good relations with U.S.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Comment.</hi> I cannot know whether timing of
                            meeting was calculated beforehand and based on new information from
                            North Vietnamese <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0450"/>or merely was
                            conceived in the circumstance and they decided to have another “go” at
                            the Americans on Vietnam. Nothing really new was said by any of us with
                            exception of <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName>'s emphasis on
                            the “signal” which we were awaiting.</p>
                        <p>7. In light of this and taking into account implication in <persName
                                corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName>'s remarks about my talking with
                            high Romanian officials, Dept may wish consider instructing me to seek
                            appointment with <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Ceausescu</persName> or
                                <persName corresp="#p_MI1">Maurer</persName> or perhaps both
                            together to go over Vietnam ground again and seek further clarification
                            of why Romanians seem confident that cessation of bombing would bring
                            about negotiations. Up to now I have deliberately refrained from seeking
                            interview with <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Ceausescu</persName>, one,
                            because he holds no government position only that of Secretary General
                            of Communist Party and two, because I have always thought I should
                            reserve such occasion for an urgent important subject or, as in the case
                            of the British and since then of other Western Ambassadors, when a high
                            level visit took place in Romania or a top Romanian delegation went to
                            U.S.</p>
                        <p>8. If Dept thinks well of this idea I would go to <persName
                                corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> and, referring to our
                            conversation on train, ask on instructions to see <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN1">Ceausescu</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_MI1"
                                >Maurer</persName> or perhaps both together in view importance which
                            U.S. attaches to any development which could lead to Vietnam settlement.
                            I suspect meeting would be quickly arranged and conceivably could throw
                            more light on <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName>'s

                                >Ceausescu</persName> on January 31 I had referred to a question

                                >Manescu</persName> during a previous meeting whether the United
                            States correctly understood Romanian policy.<note n="2" xml:id="d155fn2"
                                >See <ref target="#d154">Document 154</ref>.</note> I had assured
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> as I wished to do
                            now that I was confident President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                                >Johnson</persName> and U.S. Government were well informed of and
                            understood Romanian policies. I said the United States had followed with
                            close interest the development of these policies in the last few years,
                            particularly those in support of its national independence and in
                            seeking actively to develop good relations with all countries. We
                            thought Romanian policy generally sought to remove misunderstandings and
                            to promote an atmosphere of détente which could make a contribution
                            toward the establishment of lasting peace.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Ceausescu</persName> said I was correct in
                            appraising Romanian policies. Romania was preoccupied with pursuing a
                            policy of developing its economy and to assure the independence and
                            sovereignty of the country and nation. These are the principles which
                            guide Romania in relation to all countries. In current conditions these
                            policies correspond to the general interest of peace. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN1">Ceausescu</persName> expressed belief that nations
                            and national states will continue to have an important role to play in
                            the life of international relations. “Life itself shows this,” he said.
                            A healthy international atmosphere must be based on trust and confidence
                            between States, and this means respect for the independence and
                            sovereignty of each individual nation and non-interference in internal
                            affairs. Romania believes in development of good relations with all
                            States irrespective of their social system. In Europe Romania has
                            relations with all States with the exception of the Federal Republic of
                            Germany, but this too will be solved. (<hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi>
                            As all the world knew and indeed was announced in the Romanian press on
                            February 1, agreement had already been reached between Romania and the
                            Federal Republic of Germany to establish diplomatic relations.)
                                <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Ceausescu</persName> said this would
                            contribute to the creation of a better atmosphere in Europe. At the same
                            time, Romania sought to establish and maintain diplomatic relations with
                            all States in every continent, and the results had been encouraging.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Ceausescu</persName> then said he would like
                            to say a few words about Romania's bilateral relations with the United
                            States. One could say these were normal. We do have economic relations
                            and diplomatic relations, and recently there have been various
                            delegations which have visited Romania. One could still say relations
                            were not so normal, especially economic. Trade exchanges between Romania
                            and the United States amounted to only a few million dollars annually,
                            while with the Federal Republic of Germany, with which Romania had no
                            diplomatic relations, the annual trade turnover ran to hundreds of
                            millions. This was also true <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0452"/>of
                            France, Italy and Japan where with the latter economic relations were
                            developing rapidly. “Why is it harder to develop economic relations with
                            the United States?” he asked. We have no bilateral problems either in
                            the past or now. Perhaps on the U.S. side there are some problems, but
                            Romania has no knowledge of them yet. Perhaps the presence of war (i.e.,
                            Vietnam) represents a “sort of hindrance“, but still we could develop
                            our economic relations. Relations between States receive shape through
                            many aspects of contact: trade, cultural, scientific, etc. Perhaps the
                            United States and Romania were in the platonic stage, but, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN1">Ceausescu</persName> added with a smile, the
                            platonic stage of love is short-lived. In developing relations and
                            friendship, economic and scientific exchanges are important.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Ceausescu</persName> said he wanted to be
                            understood. Romania wanted to develop such relations to the extent the
                            United States desired. What Romania cannot buy in the United States, it
                            could buy elsewhere in Western Europe or from Japan. Romania does not
                            lag behind in its economic development because of the lack of U.S.
                            trade. Romania was not waiting. As they say, when conditions are ripe
                            perhaps we can develop good relations. Romania understands when a
                            government or businessmen do not desire to develop trade or to keep it
                            at a certain level. We have no hard feelings. (<hi rend="italic"
                                >Comment:</hi> Here, I think <persName corresp="#p_CN1"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> had in mind the failure of the negotiations
                            with the Firestone Rubber Company for building synthetic rubber plants,
                            though he did not specifically so state.) This does not have a negative
                            effect on our relations with the United States.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Ceausescu</persName> then turned to Europe
                            and expressed the opinion that we knew Romanian views. Romania had
                            “revolutionary opinion”. Romania believes the Eastern European countries
                            can develop relations with all countries without interference from
                            abroad. Hence, Romania's position on military blocs and the presence of
                            military troops. Romania was not against the policy of European
                            countries developing their relations with the United States or other
                            countries. But these can only be good when they are no longer based on
                            military alliances or military bases. <persName corresp="#p_CN1"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> said the Romanians had an old saying that
                            friends are good to have visit, but if they forget to leave then
                            relations grow cooler. The withdrawal of U.S. and other troops from
                            Europe would not cool relations but, on the contrary, strengthen them.
                            But this is a future problem which must find a solution. The longer
                            blocs remain, there will be continued danger to the peace, and that is
                            why Romania believes that both <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                            the Warsaw Pact should be dissolved. This position was not directed
                            against anyone, but was a requirement of the international situation.
                            When this was accomplished it would help to improve relations and
                            contribute to the establishment of a lasting peace.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I expressed appreciation for his frankness in commenting on
                            Romanian policies and our bilateral relations. First with regard to his
                                <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0453"/>comments on Europe, I said
                            we could understand the Romanian position, but the question of the
                            dissolution of the two existing military alliances depended upon the
                            solution of the larger questions of European security and German
                            reunification. This, in turn, depended to a large degree on the creation
                            of mutual understanding and trust, about which <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN1">Ceausescu</persName> had previously spoken, as well
                            as solid agreements. I said I had already commented on the interest with
                            which the United States followed Romanian policies of developing

                            sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>Turning to our bilateral relations, I said I wished to recall
                            particularly the words of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                                >Johnson</persName> in his State of the Union message in relation to
                            U.S. policy toward the countries of Eastern Europe.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d155fn3">For text of the President's 1967 State of the Union
                                message, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of
                                    the United States: Lyndon B. Johnson, 1967</hi>, Book I, pp.
                                2–14.</note> I said that in carrying out U.S. policy of developing
                            better relations with these countries, we recognized there were points
                            of disagreement, but where we disagreed we tried to do so quietly and
                            seek out those areas where we could agree. We did not wish to continue a
                            cold war but to end it.</p>
                        <p>The United States sought to increase its contacts with Eastern Europe
                            including Romania in all fields: economic, cultural, tourism, and
                            scientific and educational exchanges. The Administration had proposed to
                            Congress an East-West trade bill which would give the President
                            authority to negotiate trade agreements including the granting of equal
                            tariff treatment. Speaking frankly, based on my own talks with visiting
                            Members of Congress and on reports the Embassy had from Washington, I
                            was not optimistic that Congress would take favorable action in this
                            session on an East-West trade bill. Here, the Vietnam war was, as
                                <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Ceausescu</persName> had said, “a sort of
                            hindrance”. Nevertheless, I was encouraged for the development of our
                            trade relations by the increasing number of American businessmen who had
                            come to Romania during the last six months to talk with Romanian
                            organizations and officials about trade. The Embassy did everything to
                            encourage them.</p>
                        <p>I then referred to the upcoming negotiations between Romania and the
                            United States for the renewal of a two-year exchange arrangement. Our
                            exchange programs, though modest, had been growing, and we hoped to
                            improve them further during the next two years. I also noted the recent
                            Romanian proposal for three groups of high-level Romanian officials as
                            well as directors of enterprises to visit the United States for an
                            extended period. I said we interpreted this as a good sign and that the
                            Embassy was recommending to Washington that these groups be well
                            received and a program arranged for them where they would be able to see
                            everything and to talk with those they wished.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Ceausescu</persName> concluded our meeting by
                            saying basically he was an optimist both for peace in the world and for
                            the development of good Romanian-United States relations.</p>
                        <p>I remarked that Washington did not intend to give publicity to my meeting
                            with the Secretary General, but should it become known, I intended to
                            respond to inquiries from my diplomatic colleagues in Bucharest along
                            the following lines: I would say I had requested this meeting after one
                            year in Bucharest to review our bilateral relations and certain
                            international problems of mutual interest. Ceausescu readily assented to
                            this and volunteered that the Romanian Government would not publish the
                            fact of our meeting. (<hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> It is customary
                            for the Romanian press, at least with respect to meetings between

                        <p>Over the dinner table, after discussion of China and Viet-Nam, the
                            Premier introduced the subject of US-Romanian relations. He wished to
                            speak very frankly. The Romanians would like to see these relations <pb
                                n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0455"/>closer, particularly from the
                            economic point of view. Romania did not seek aid of any kind. It wishes
                            only normal trade. This is extremely important to Romania.
                            Diversification of Romanian economic relations is a guarantee of
                            Romanian independence and sovereignty. Romania's independent economic
                            development enables it to be master in its own house. In previous talks
                            with the United States, the Romanians have met with full understanding.
                            In practice, they have met with many difficulties. Clearly the Romanians
                            cannot pay the United States for what it needs from it in dollars. It
                            can pay only in the products of its labor. This is the great problem in
                            US-Romanian relations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed agreement as to the importance of mutual
                            relations and the directions in which we should move. There are two
                            problems which arise, not out of anything Romania has done but out of a
                            broader context. We have asked the Congress for authority to give Most
                            Favored Nation treatment. There will probably be hearings this year, but
                            in the atmosphere of Viet-Nam we have very great problems not related to
                            Romania. As to credits, the Secretary expressed hope that any Romanian
                            difficulties were only temporary. He understood there was the problem of
                            a glass factory (the Romanians all nodded vigorously). We are now asking
                            the Congress for an extension of the lending authority of the Exim Bank.
                            The Secretary explained the problem of the Fiat guarantees in the
                                Congress.<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">On October 6, 1966, President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> announced that
                                the Export-Import Bank would provide guarantees for Italian credit
                                for the purchase of machine tools to be installed in a Fiat
                                automobile factory in Togliattigrad, USSR. The credits were to
                                support the largest East-West trade arrangement executed since the
                                Russian Revolution. The following year the Senate blocked any U.S.
                                participation. Fiat found credit elsewhere.</note> He asked the
                            Romanians to be patient on credits for a glass factory until the
                            Congress has acted.</p>
                        <p>The Premier remarked that when Romanian peasants don't like something
                            they scratch behind their ears. (He scratched behind his ear.)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that he knew the Romanians would not like his
                            reply, but, after all, trade was expanding. <persName corresp="#p_MI1"
                                >Maurer</persName> replied, “Not enough.” To the Secretary's comment
                            that after all democracy was a difficult form of government, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MI1">Maurer</persName> rejoined that there were
                            different forms of democracy and that we had built a very complex system
                            for ourselves.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized again that the Romanians should not draw any
                            negative conclusions as to our policy toward Romania from our current
                            legislative difficulties. <persName corresp="#p_MI1">Maurer</persName>
                            expressed understanding. He believed the United States appreciated as a
                            positive political element the desire of Romania to be independent.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary, referring to his talks with Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> in previous years, reflected
                            that perhaps he had at times given unduly encouraging views and had then
                            encountered difficulties in carrying <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428"
                                facs="0456"/>them out. He was sure, however, that once we had the
                            appropriate authority the problem of <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            could be worked out quite readily. Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> said he always fully reported on
                            his discussions and that his government was fully aware of the
                            difficulties in the United States. However, there would be measures that
                            could be taken if the United States gave due attention to the Prime
                            Minister's observations on Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed complete satisfaction with the discussion
                            and said he was not pessimistic as to the evolution of our
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was not at all pessimistic. He did not want to
                            emphasize ideology. However, the Premier should understand the attitude
                            of the American people. Since World War II we have had 250,000 dead and
                            wounded, in the Berlin Airlift, in Korea, in Southeast Asia, and
                            elsewhere. Only in recent years have the American people come to realize
                            that just as there are differences in the capitalist world, so are there
                            differences in the socialist world. It is not an answer to denounce “all
                            those capitalists” or “all those communists.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recounted how Presidents <persName>Kennedy</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and their Secretary
                            of State had pursued every channel of possible agreement within the last
                            six years. He mentioned particularly the Civil Aviation Agreement, the
                            consular treaty, the Space Treaty, hopefully a nonproliferation treaty
                            and, again, hopefully, legislation for expansion of East-West trade. We
                            are trying to find a way to limit the development of both offensive and
                            defensive weapons. There is no one more serious about organizing the
                            peace than the United States. We know the extent of destructive power in
                            the hands of frail human beings. We will in any case do our duty, what
                            we have to do, but we know that to cage the beast of nuclear power is
                            the greatest task of man. We seek to organize a genuine peace.</p>
                        <p>The Premier replied that the Romanians base their policy on the
                            assumption that the United States is genuinely interested in peace. If
                            they didn't believe that, there would be no use in a frank discussion.
                            However the Romanians don't always approve the means the United States
                            relies on to achieve its purposes. However, one of us or another, or
                            both, may be mistaken as to the means.</p>
                        <p>The Premier expressed complete agreement with the Secretary's suggestion
                            that we should continue to exchange ideas, that both sides can learn
                            something in such an exchange and perhaps new ideas would emerge.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that we were only halfway in our discussion with
                            Premier Kosygin.<note n="3" xml:id="d156fn3">For documentation on the

                            than <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0457"/>a mere courtesy visit.
                            There will be a further discussion and perhaps clarification of some of
                            the issues.</p>
                        <p>The Premier hoped that this would be so. He holds Kosygin in great
                            esteem. Kosygin is tenacious but a man with whom one can talk. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MI1">Maurer</persName> has no reason always to be happy
                            with him. Maurer has given Kosygin annoyance and Kosygin has given
                                <persName corresp="#p_MI1">Maurer</persName> annoyance. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MI1">Maurer</persName> hopes that solutions will be
                            found which can have only good effects on international life.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary discussed the manner in which a hostile nature could make
                            allies of us all. Science and technology open the way of cooperation.
                            There are many matters of interest to all men independent of ideology
                            and individual interest. There is no communist cholera or communist
                            plague. All people need water. Wheat rust is a common problem.</p>
                        <p>The Premier said the importance of the explosive nature of scientific
                            development and its penetration into production could not be
                            exaggerated. We might be on the eve of a time when goods will be so
                            abundant that their exchange value will become null. The leader in this
                            process is the United States. <persName corresp="#p_MI1"
                                >Maurer</persName> does not know who will be the leader in the next
                            stage but he thought that from the Marxist point of view the United
                            States was the leader of the movement of capitalist society to its
                            dialectical antithesis.</p>
                        <p>The discussion ended with the Secretary noting the manner in which
                            starting from a highly individualistic point of view we had developed
                            the concept of social responsibility for the welfare of the individual.
                            Perhaps Romania could find a way by which the value of the individual
                            could be fully recognized in a socialist system.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister began by expressing his great appreciation to the
                            President for taking time from a busy schedule to receive him. He noted
                            that he had recently had a long discussion with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> in New York on matters of common
                            interest and that these talks had been very successful.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d157fn2">See <ref target="#d156">Document 156</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he had talked in the first instance with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> about the Middle
                            East, where they seemed to have found a similarity of views due to the
                            fact that both felt that everything possible should be done to obtain
                            peace in the Middle East and that this was a question which must be
                            approached in a realistic spirit, avoiding excessive claims.</p>
                        <p>They had also exchanged views about Viet-Nam. The Prime Minister had told
                            the Secretary very frankly of the Romanian desire to have the
                            Viet-Namese question settled. It is troublesome to Romania and to
                            everyone; it is, in fact, particularly troublesome for the smaller
                            countries. Viet-Nam is a hot-bed of danger, which the Prime Minister
                            felt could do damage to Romanian desires for freedom and independence.
                            The Prime Minister said he would be pleased if the President could
                            understand the special interest of Romania in settling the Viet-Namese
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister wished to make his views quite plain. He believed that
                            a way had to be found for American troops to be withdrawn from Viet-Nam.
                            He understood that, in this, Romanian attitudes were different from
                            those of the United States; however, he had the impression that the
                            Secretary had understood the Romanian viewpoint, <pb n="431"
                                xml:id="pg_431" facs="0459"/>which sprang from the desire of Romania
                            for freedom and independence. Tension anywhere in the world creates
                            difficulties for smaller countries and the possibilities for achieving
                            independence become more restricted. The Prime Minister commented that
                            he thought there was less similarity between the U.S. and Romania on
                            Viet-Nam than there was about the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister had taken up a third subject with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, that of relations between our two
                            countries. He had pointed to the Romanian desire that these relations
                            expand, particularly in the sphere of economic relations and scientific
                            and technical cooperation. He was well aware that the U.S., as a large
                            country, had nothing to gain from exchanges with such a small country as
                            Romania. On the contrary, Romania would stand to gain and that, indeed,
                            was the Romanian purpose, since the economic development of Romania was
                            a most important element in her striving for independence. However, even
                            if economic relations with Romania were not especially important for the
                            U.S., perhaps Romania's political independence would be something of
                            interest to the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that some of the Secretary's views on bilateral
                            relations had been encouraging, while some had not been so encouraging.
                            He had told the Prime Minister of the desire of the U.S. to develop
                            relations with Romania, but he had pointed out difficulties in this
                            regard which derived from the present international situation. These
                            concern certain agreements which had been concluded between our two
                            countries several years ago on the basis of mutual advantage. These had
                            contemplated the use of credits, either short or long term. With regard
                            to one of the projects which was dear to the Prime Minister's heart, the
                            purchase of a glass plant from the U.S., the Secretary had said that
                            there might be problems because of the danger that the Congress might
                            not make it possible for the Export-Import Bank to extend credit to
                            socialist countries.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister could understand that there might be some problems
                            about which nothing could be done. However, he very much hoped that the
                            glass plant project could go through, since this was an important
                            element in Romanian planning. The Prime Minister said that, to the
                            extent that the President could contribute to developing U.S-Romanian
                            relations, he thought this would be a useful step in the context of
                            improved international relations generally and fulfilling obligations
                            toward the human community.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the Secretary had reported to him on his talk
                            with the Prime Minister and he could not add very much to what the
                            Secretary had already said. The President regretted that Romania and the
                            U.S. had different approaches to the problem of Viet-Nam, although he
                            appreciated the reasonable position of Romania. The President said that
                                <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0460"/>those closest to the
                            problem feel differently about it than those farther away. This might
                            make us understand the problem better but, on the other hand, it might
                            also make us less objective. In any event, the President appreciated the
                            candid and frank remarks of the Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we are very anxious for U.S. troops to leave
                            Viet-Nam, which they will do as soon as the North Viet-Namese troops
                            leave the country. We do not feel that we can run away and leave the
                            South Viet-Namese to face the aggressors. We have an alliance with South
                            Viet-Nam and we will help to defend the country when it is attacked. So
                            far as the political structure in South Viet-Nam is concerned, we favor
                            elections which could be supervised by any objective group. We do not
                            believe that we have the right, even though an ally, to tell the people
                            of South Viet-Nam what kind of government they should have. They should
                            have the right to vote freely and to choose their own leaders. Whether
                            we like the leaders or not is unimportant; the main thing is that there
                            should be honest, free elections.</p>
                        <p>We do not wish to fight North Viet-Nam. It takes two to make a fight. If
                            North Viet-Nam would stay behind the line, if they would stop sending
                            troops and supplies into South Viet-Nam and stop the violence there,
                            then we would turn the buildings, hangars and construction that have
                            been built in South Viet-Nam into schools and hospitals, and we would
                            bring our troops home within six months, as we have said we would do. We
                            know that no country wants troops of a foreign power on its soil. If the
                            North Viet-Namese troops would stay on their own soil, then our troops
                            would stay in the United States. However, if North Viet-Nam insists on
                            using power and on saying that “might makes right“, then we will
                            resist.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we are not trying to reform the North Viet-Namese
                            Government, but they are invading South Viet-Nam. Four or five divisions
                            are ready to enter South Viet-Nam as soon as we stop bombing. We are not
                            trying to destroy North Viet-Nam nor to invade their land. All we ask is
                            that they stay in their country and we in ours. If anyone can get Ho Chi
                            Minh to send his troops home and cease the infiltration and violence,
                            then the Americans will go home, but we are not prepared to raise the
                            white flag of surrender and to let the aggressors win.</p>
                        <p>Just as we do not wish to destroy North Viet-Nam, we do not want war with
                            China or to change the system of government in China. We hope that China
                            will join the society of nations. We have no designs on her territory or
                            her philosophy. All we want to do is to trade with China and get along
                            with her to the extent that she will permit.</p>
                        <p>The President appreciated the Prime Minister's approach to these matters
                            and his desire to talk about them. We wish to be friendly with the <pb
                                n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0461"/>Rumanian people. We would like
                            to see the East-West Trade Bill passed as well as the Export-Import Bank
                            legislation so that our relations could be improved.<note n="3"

                                debate on trade policy. In 1968, Congress approved S–1155 as P.L.
                                90–267, extending the Export-Import Bank for 5 years. The Congress
                                failed to act on HR–17551, the Trade Expansion Act of 1968.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President understood the desires of Romania to seek better living
                            conditions for its people. Although countries may have different views
                            on various matters, there are many things which we have in common. All
                            of us have problems with ignorance, poverty and disease and we should
                            all work together as brothers to fight these enemies rather than each
                            other.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that Congress sometimes did not have as liberal a
                            view as he did about some of these things, but he thought that if
                            Members of Congress could hear the Prime Minister, or could hear
                            Chairman Kosygin, then they might change their views.</p>
                        <p>The President was determined to work to improve relations with Romania.
                            He told the story of Charles Lamb who, when asked if he knew the author
                            of a book he had not enjoyed, said that he did not know the author but
                            if he knew him he would like him. The President thought that it had been
                            helpful for the Prime Minister to visit the United Nations, to talk with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, and to come to the
                            White House. The President said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1"
                                >Katzenbach</persName> would be glad to consider in a detailed way
                            such questions as the glass factory which the Prime Minister had
                            mentioned. The President wished to approach such problems with a desire
                            to reach an understanding.</p>
                        <p>Even though Romania is a small country, the President said the United
                            States was very interested in its relationship with us. We feel an
                            obligation upon the United States to do what is right in the world.
                            Although we may sometimes make mistakes, we do our best. We would like
                            to improve trade with Romania and to see an improvement in the welfare
                            of Romania. He looked to the day when there were no great differences
                            between us. The President said what we want most from Romania is not
                            trade or approval but that Romania would try to understand the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the Prime Minister was going to visit other
                            countries and that he was at liberty to describe the conversation he had
                            had with the President and to quote whatever he had said, if this would
                            be useful.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would like to talk with the Chinese about a
                            non-proliferation treaty and to work out ground rules so that we can
                            avoid nuclear war. He repeated that we would like to bring our troops
                                <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0462"/>home from Viet-Nam and he
                            said that if the Prime Minister could persuade Ho Chi Minh to withdraw
                            his troops, the Prime Minister could promise to produce the President
                            the next morning to begin negotiations. However, it takes two to
                            negotiate and we cannot do it all ourselves. Whenever Ho Chi Minh is
                            ready, the President would be ready and he will talk about anything that
                            Ho Chi Minh wants to talk about. The President wants to stop the war but
                            he cannot stop just his half of the war.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he was very pleased with what he had heard
                            from the President. While he might not agree with everything the
                            President had said, he did not wish to argue any points in detail. As
                            the President probably knew, Romania did not limit herself to expressing
                            her views to the United States. She has spoken of her views previously
                            to other countries and will do so in the future. The Prime Minister
                            noted that he would be in Peking on July 3.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister hoped that the President did not think that Romania
                            aspired to playing an important role in international debate. All that
                            Romania wished was to be master in its own house. As it happens, this
                            ideal for Romania cannot be achieved when there is a crisis of tension
                            in the world. Then countries are told to get together, to renounce some
                            of their sovereignty and some of their independence and to obey the
                            command of another state. The Prime Minister said that these actions
                            endanger what Romania has won, and which they wish to preserve at all
                            costs. It is this consideration which causes Romania to interfere in
                            problems which really are beyond her and to try to settle them.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister noted that this was his first visit in the U.S., but
                            he said that since hostilities began in Viet-Nam he had visited there
                            four times. This shows that whatever Romania does springs from a belief
                            that difficult problems should be resolved. He thought this was the
                            President's belief as well.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that it was helpful to him to have heard the
                            President's views. He did not know what use he would make of them—that
                            remained to be seen.</p>
                        <p>The President said he understood and that he had been happy to hear the
                            Prime Minister's comments and to give him ours. He hoped to achieve an
                            understanding based on all the information available, since a man is
                            only as good as his information.</p>
                        <p>The President said that it would be the height of folly, it would be
                            prehistoric and like a cave man's approach, for the United States to
                            want to go to war with China. Nothing was farther from his mind.</p>
                        <p>The President said that about 30 million people in the U.S. live in
                            poverty. He felt we should spend money to help them rather than spending
                            money on bombs. He also hoped that part of our budget now spent on
                            military expenditures could be used for the economic development of <pb
                                n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0463"/>the Mekong Delta. We want
                            Indonesia to be free. We wish the same for Japan, Korea, the Philippines
                            and other countries. We do not wish to impose our views on them and we
                            honestly want them to decide their future. The President hoped the Prime
                            Minister would understand the United States better as a result of his
                            visit. Now he knew more about what we were thinking and could tell
                            others.</p>
                        <p>The visit ended with repeated thanks by the Prime Minister for the
                            President's courtesy in receiving him.</p>
                        <p>Following the visit, the President and Romanian party went to the Rose
                            Garden for photographs. During a brief exchange on this occasion, the
                            Prime Minister mentioned that Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> probably would be the President
                            of the next General Assembly of the United Nations. The President said
                            that he would be a good man and that we had heard good things about
                            him.</p>
                        <p>In a brief statement to journalists in the White House press room
                            following the interview with the President, the Prime Minister said that
                            he had presented his respects to the President and that they had had a
                            useful and frank exchange on topical questions. He said that he was
                            leaving with a particularly strong memory of a great leader and a great
                            state.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>A review of Romanian foreign policy suggests that the Romanians will
                            continue along well established lines, although they may make some
                            concessions—more of a formal than a substantive nature—to Moscow.</p>
                        <p>Will Romanian foreign policy in 1968 be more cautious than in 1967? The
                            question is valid in view of the developments of the past year.</p>
                        <p>Very recently, reliable information came to light that Moscow and other
                            bloc countries have been exerting economic pressure on Romania
                            (Bucharest 901).<note n="2" xml:id="d158fn2">Telegram 901, December 22,
                                1967, reported on Soviet economic pressures on Romania. (Ibid., E 1
                                RUM–USSR)</note> To the extent that these pressures include a Soviet
                            refusal to buy Romanian oil drilling rigs, the materials published here
                            on the 1968 Romanian-Soviet trade protocol (signed December 30, 1967) do
                            not indicate that the pressure is off. We had long assumed that Romania
                            was under strong pressure, but the only evidence was indirect and
                            circumstantial: the logic of the situation (Romania's defiance of Moscow
                            in establishing diplomatic relations with West Germany, staying away
                            from the conference of European Communist Parties at Karlovy Vary, and
                            refusing to join in the bloc position on the Middle East), Romanian
                            accusations or intimations of interference in internal affairs by
                            unidentified parties (in particular, Ceausescu's article in <gloss

                                rend="italic">Scinteia</hi> of May 7), and the evident irritation of
                            Moscow and other bloc countries toward Romania (as reflected, inter
                            alia, in the propaganda against nationalism).</p>
                        <p>In addition, Romanian internal policy is perhaps a complicating factor

                                target="#t_RCP1">RCP</gloss> National Conference imply a broad
                            personnel reshuffle in the central and local Party and State apparatus.
                            They also imply a reduction in the size of this apparatus. While some
                            will be promoted, many will lose out in the process. The prospect of
                            such changes presumably is a dismal one for many if not most of the
                            Party apparatchiks. And the need to grapple with this <pb n="437"
                                xml:id="pg_437" facs="0465"/>problem is perhaps responsible for the
                            evident caution of the leadership in moving ahead on the economic
                            reform, witness the introduction of a slow schedule of implementation at
                            the <gloss target="#t_RCP1">RCP</gloss> National Conference, the
                            blurring of responsibilities for economic activities at the local level,
                            and the carte blanche enabling law passed by the Grand National
                            Assembly. In passing, it is perhaps worth noting that none of the
                            measures approved by the Conference are likely to stir up any
                            compensating popular enthusiasm.</p>
                        <p>Whether Moscow and its allies can or will try to capitalize on the
                            dissatisfaction which presumably will develop in the ranks of the
                            Romanian Communist Party remains to be seen. (In theory they could take
                            advantage of the vast number of contacts with Romanians which constantly
                            take place—exchanges of Party, State, and mass organization
                            delegations—to strengthen such dissatisfaction.) All that is said here
                            is that, notwithstanding the show of unity toward Moscow implicit in the
                            continued presence of the “old guard” leaders in the top Party organs,
                            Romania will be more vulnerable to outside pressure than before.</p>
                        <p>To a degree, Romania's foreign policy in 1968 will depend upon the
                            foreign policy initiatives of the Soviet Union. But only to a degree.
                            Regardless of what the Soviets do or do not do, the Romanians are busy
                            steadily decreasing their economic and political dependence on Moscow
                            and its allies. In the communist world, they have done their best to
                            maintain a facade of cordial relations with Communist China and Albania
                            and they have assiduously cultivated other countries and parties which
                            tend to assert their independence from Moscow. Cuba is a recent case in
                            point. A more long-standing example is Yugoslavia. The Romanians have
                            been very active in trying to restore the excellent rapport which
                            existed between them and the Yugoslavs before <persName corresp="#p_CN1"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> fell out on the Middle East question. At the same
                            time, the Romanians have expanded their ties with the West and with the
                            less-developed countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They have
                            also made the most of international forums (notably the UN) and regional
                            groupings (e.g., the Group of Nine and the Balkans). Since these
                            activities are vital to the consolidation of their independence, the
                            Romanians will surely continue along these lines in 1968.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union, for its part, seems determined to press ahead with a
                            variety of policies the Romanians abhor: attacking “Mao and his clique“,
                            isolating West Germany from Eastern Europe, siding with the Arab
                            countries against Israel, promoting conferences of communist parties,
                            and, perhaps, “strengthening” the Warsaw Pact. The presumed Soviet
                            interest in renewing the Soviet-Romanian Treaty of Friendship, <pb

                                189.</note> and concluding a non-proliferation treaty also present
                            difficulties for the Romanians.</p>
                        <p>Barring a substantial deterioration in East-West relations, the Romanians
                            will not allow Moscow to impair their relations with third parties. They
                            will not attack Communist China nor will they join in any condemnation
                            of West Germany or Israel. (Romanian participation in the December 19–21
                            meeting of Eastern European foreign ministers on the Middle East does
                            not reflect a change in the Romanian position. Evidently, the price of
                            Romanian participation was a communiqué consistent with the line taken
                            in Romania's formal statements on the subject.) The Romanians could not
                            afford to follow Moscow in these matters.</p>
                        <p>On the other questions, however, there is more room for maneuver.
                            Unquestionably, the Romanians would prefer to stay away from the
                            Budapest consultative conference of communist parties.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d158fn4">The conference was held February 26–March 5.</note>
                            By implication at least, the proceedings will have a pro-Moscow,
                            anti-Peking flavor.</p>
                        <p>Since it is only a preparatory conference, however—and hence presumably
                            will not produce “binding documents”—the Romanians may find it hard to
                            stay away. If they attend (and the Yugoslav Embassy in Bucharest seems
                            to think that they will), the Romanians presumably will use the occasion
                            to reassert their well known views about the conditions under which
                            communist conferences are desirable (along the lines of the Scinteia
                            article of February 28, 1967).</p>
                        <p>In connection with the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual
                            Assistance with the Soviet Union, it is not clear whether the Romanians
                            would prefer no treaty at all, an automatic five-year renewal of the
                            treaty, or a new treaty. Whatever their motives, they seem to have
                            decided to negotiate a new 20-year treaty. In so doing, one can assume
                            that they will insist on acceptable wording and that the new treaty will
                            neither heap abuse on the West Germans nor speak of the desirability of
                            arriving at joint positions on international problems. This could be
                            read as a further example of the determination of the Romanians to
                            “stick to their guns“, especially if the new treaty is not signed before
                            the end of the first 20-year period, on February 4, 1968. The failure of
                            the Romanians and Bulgarians to renew a similar treaty before the
                            expiration of the first 20-year period on January 16, 1968 indicates
                            that the Romanians are probably taking a firm position in their
                            negotiations with Moscow.</p>
                        <p>As regards <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, it is difficult to tell
                            just how seriously the Romanians view their own objections to it.
                            Although <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> presents the same type of
                            problems for Romania as for other non-nuclear countries, it is very
                            likely that the purpose of surfacing their objections was to show <pb
                                n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0467"/>Moscow that Bucharest must be
                            consulted on such matters. If so, their signature of a non-proliferation
                            treaty would not be as much of a concession as it might appear at first
                            glance. As a matter of fact, we would not be surprised to see them end
                            up by signing a non-proliferation treaty, particularly if many of the
                            other non-nuclear powers are willing to sign it.</p>
                        <p>As for the Warsaw Pact, it is not at all certain that we are in for
                            another Soviet offensive directed toward “strengthening” the Warsaw
                            Pact, although the latest Soviet communiqués with the East Germans and
                            Romanians suggest that this may be the case. If so, the participation of
                            Romania in the August 21–27 Warsaw Pact maneuvers in Bulgaria and the
                            statement about strengthening the Warsaw Pact Organization in the joint
                            communiqué with the Soviets would seem to imply a co-operative attitude
                            on the part of the Romanians. On the other hand, some of their other
                            activities seem to have the opposite implication. In 1967, the Romanian
                            leadership emphasized the need for less reliance on traditional sources
                            of arms supplies. The Romanians also organized a military exercise of
                            their own on October 12–13 to which no Warsaw Pact observers were
                            invited and sent lower-ranking delegates than those of other countries
                            to the October 13–17 Warsaw Pact meeting in East Germany. On balance, we
                            would judge that the Romanians would not be willing to go along with any
                            Soviet proposal which, in substance, would increase Romanian involvement
                            in Warsaw Pact affairs.</p>
                        <p>We doubt very much that the Romanian willingness to compromise with the
                            Soviets would go beyond the framework discussed above. At the most, in
                            our judgment, the Romanians might make certain concessions which are
                            more of a formal than a substantive nature—e.g., attendance at the
                            Budapest conference, and, if this can be considered a concession,
                            renewal of the bilateral treaty with the Soviet Union—while continuing
                            to defend their national interests in dealing with Moscow and steadily
                            building up the material and political basis of their independence. The
                            determination to continue along well established lines was reflected in
                            the joint communiqué signed with the Soviets on December 15 and,
                            external pressures and internal uncertainties aside, would be the
                            logical consequence of the fact that <persName corresp="#p_CN1"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> and his team have emerged stronger than ever
                            from the <gloss target="#t_RCP1">RCP</gloss> National Conference.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, the extent of the Romanian willingness to compose [<hi
                                rend="italic">compromise</hi>?] with the Soviets will bear close
                            watching. In formulating policy in the future, the Romanians will no
                            doubt take account of the reactions of Moscow and its allies to
                            Romania's rather dramatic assertion of independence in 1967. Presumably,
                            they will also consider whether far-reaching internal changes should
                            incite them to greater prudence in international affairs. Under these
                            circumstances, more than ever the <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440"

                        <p>The Ambassador referred to the recent trade agreement signed in Ottawa
                            between Romania and Canada.<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">For text of the
                                agreement, signed on March 22, see 870 UNTS 9.</note> This provided

                            treatment in exchange for a general commitment on Romania's part to make
                            purchases in Canada of no less than $9,000,000 annually. The Ambassador
                            said this latter commitment had been very difficult for Romania to make
                            since it was not the usual practice to provide such an undertaking;
                            however, the Canadians had insisted on it.</p>
                        <p>With regard to US-Romanian economic relations, the Ambassador said he
                            understood the problems caused by the current political situation in
                            relation to Viet-Nam, although he hoped that progress could be made. <pb

                            something could be done with regard to obtaining a synthetic rubber
                            plant from Goodyear, a subject he had mentioned to the Under

                        </p>
                        <p>With reference to his recent urgent consultation in Bucharest, the
                            Ambassador said this had been primarily to engage in discussions in his
                            capital with regard to decisions which must be made in the near future
                            concerning Romania's five-year plan. Of special concern in this regard
                            is the planning for nuclear installations to produce electric power.
                            Romania has decided to go in the direction of obtaining plants which can
                            utilize Romanian uranium and this will involve obtaining heavy water
                            plants. The Ambassador indicated that this subject had been taken up
                            with the Canadians and that there was some interest in obtaining a heavy
                            water plant from Canada, although the Canadians themselves had not had
                            extensive practical experience in this field.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador recalled that Romania had approached a US concern sometime
                            ago in connection with obtaining heavy water technology, but that this
                            apparently had encountered some problems on the part of the American
                            Government. Given the urgency of their own planning process, the
                            Ambassador hoped that this question might be resolved favorably in the
                            near future.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> noted that, with the
                            progress which has been made concerning the NPT, it might be considered
                            that we were in a new situation and it was conceivable that something
                            could be done. In any case, he assured the Ambassador that we would take
                            another look at the problem.</p>

                            that, while Romania has a positive attitude toward the <gloss
                                target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, they are concerned about certain
                            aspects of the proposed treaty. In some respects, the treaty seems to
                            freeze many inequalities which presently exist between nuclears and
                            non-nuclears. Also, Romania is concerned about possible adverse economic
                            effects of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and, in addition,
                            believes that the formula which has been advanced to cover the question
                            of assurances to non-nuclear states is inadequate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> reviewed in some detail
                            the many consultations we have had with interested countries about the
                                <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> over a long period of time. <pb
                                n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0470"/>These consultations became
                            particularly intensive beginning in December 1966, when it appeared for
                            the first time that the Soviets were serious about an <gloss
                                target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. As a result of these consultations,
                            many improvements have been made in the draft treaty and our feeling is
                            that many of the earlier concerns which countries have expressed have
                            been met. For example, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> seems
                            much less worried about the adverse economic effects of an <gloss
                                target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. We recognize that the draft is not a
                            perfect instrument, but we feel that its approval by a large number of
                            states would be a significant step forward. On the other hand, to open
                            up the draft to a large number of amendments would risk having the
                            project fail entirely. We are concerned that the momentum which has been
                            built up for the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> should not be lost
                            and we therefore hope that following discussions at the resumed General
                            Assembly there will be agreement to approve the treaty.</p>

                        <p>In response to the Ambassador's questions, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said that he anticipated that
                            economic integration in Western Europe would continue to be strengthened
                            through the Common Market and that Great Britain eventually would join
                            this organization. He foresaw an increase in contacts between Western
                            Europe and the countries of Eastern Europe, but he did not think it was
                            practical to expect that there would be an over-all integration between
                            the two areas. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> stressed
                            that he felt the Common Market is here to stay and that the Eastern
                            European countries will have to deal with it to an increasing
                            extent.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName> acknowledged that
                            this probably was the case, although he said Romania would prefer to
                            deal bilaterally with other countries. There was a brief discussion of
                                <gloss target="#t_COMECON1">COMECON</gloss> and the Ambassador
                            seemed to deprecate the possibility that <gloss target="#t_COMECON1"
                                >COMECON</gloss> would play an important role vis-à-vis the Common
                            Market. In this context, he stressed Romania's desire to be as
                            independent as possible in all respects.</p>

                        <p>Responding to the Ambassador's queries on this subject, we outlined our
                            view that the process of achieving European security would be a slow
                            one, proceeding by small steps with no practical possibility that one
                            over-all conference would solve basic security problems. We also noted
                            US interest in the question of European security which, after all, is
                            part of a global problem.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he recognized the US interest in this subject and he

                            left this question vague. He felt that the US-Soviet presence in Europe
                            was a fact which must be recognized. He thought it was desirable to
                            change this situation and that such change was inevitable, but the
                            question was how this change could get started in a political sense. He
                            felt this was a complicated and difficult problem but that it should be

                        </list>
                        <p>I had lunch today with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BC1"
                                >Bogdan</persName> and Romanian <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>
                            Iosif Gheorghiu, at Bogdan's invitation.</p>
                        <p>I said we were sorry to hear of <persName corresp="#p_BA1"
                                >Birladeanu</persName>'s illness and mentioned that I thought Dr.
                            Hornig was proposing June 19 as a substitute date for the start of the
                            visit. <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName> was interested, and
                            pleased about the visit.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName> described his recent trip
                            to the West Coast. He had visited Seattle (the University of
                            Washington), Portland, the San Francisco area (including the Center for
                            the Study of Democratic Institutions, Berkeley, San Francisco State and
                            Claremont as the guest of Fred Warner Neal), and Los Angeles (the
                            Universal Studios, Disneyland, the Mayor's office, etc.). Apparently
                                <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName> had made a number of
                            speeches, had rather little sleep, and enjoyed the experience.</p>
                        <p>Bogdan said he had come back to Washington, only to turn around to visit
                            the Goodyear people in Akron. He believes Goodyear has the best
                            synthetic rubber process in the world, and is most interested in getting
                            them to pick up the old Firestone project. Apparently the Goodyear
                            people told Bogdan that synthetic rubber remains more expensive than
                            natural rubber. They wonder why Romania really wants to put up such a
                            plant. Bogdan indicated that foreign exchange was a consideration—as
                            well as a certain desire for self-sufficiency (assuming one has the raw
                                <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0473"/>materials, which Romania
                            does). Bogdan went on to acknowledge that Romania could hardly strive
                            for autarky, but nevertheless had an interest in standing on its own two
                            feet.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName> said the Goodyear people
                            expressed some interest in a plant in Romania on the grounds that
                            Romania's cheap natural resources might enable the plant to become
                            competitive with natural rubber in Western Europe. Apparently there is
                            some problem with the fact that Goodyear normally retains a controlling
                            ownership interest in its plants constructed abroad. Concluding his
                            discussion of the Goodyear visit, <persName corresp="#p_BC1"
                                >Bogdan</persName> expressed the strong hope that the U.S. would
                            help convince the Goodyear management that it was worthwhile to send a
                            representative to Romania to examine the prospects seriously.</p>
                        <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName> whether Romania was
                            experiencing any licensing problems. He said none that he knew of except
                            the question of the heavy water plant. I told <persName corresp="#p_BC1"
                                >Bogdan</persName> I knew that question was under active
                            consideration. Answering a question of mine, <persName corresp="#p_BC1"
                                >Bogdan</persName> said the Romanians hope to buy the reactor itself
                            from General Electric in Canada—adding that he presumed that firm had
                            “some connection” with General Electric in the U.S. He said that—apart
                            from the question whether the U.S. would be willing to sell a
                            reactor—there was a foreign exchange advantage in making the reactor
                            purchase in Canada rather than in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName> if the rubber and
                            heavy water plants represented their high priority interests. He said
                            there was a third—their desire to purchase a plant to make integrated
                            circuits. Apparently they would like to buy it from IBM.</p>
                        <p>The conversation turned to politics, and I asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName> how he viewed the situation in
                            New York. He said he had just been in New York talking with Foreign
                            Minister Manescu. <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName>'s pitch
                            was that the U.S. and USSR should accept at least a few amendments to
                            the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> in order to make the General
                            Assembly debate a serious and responsible one, and not simply a rubber
                            stamp. <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName> was aware of the
                            recent Mexican proposals and seemed quite interested in them. He also
                            raised the question of Security Assurances, commenting that he realized
                            the U.S and the USSR would have to stand together on any issue in the
                            Security Council if the assurances were to have any meaning. I remarked
                            that the question of security commitments was a very touchy one in the
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName> acknowledged the danger of
                            the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> coming unraveled, but said we
                            ought to be able to find a way to make some concessions to the desire of
                            many nations to improve the treaty—without opening Pandora's Box. He
                            expressed the view that everybody was now resigned to India not
                            signing—although she might adhere at a later time. When he asked me if I
                            agreed, I said I thought we still hoped that India would find it
                            possible to sign. <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName> repeated
                            several times that Romania had no desire to obstruct proceedings—but
                            hoped that at least a few changes <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446"
                                facs="0474"/>could be made. When I asked him how long he thought the
                            session in New York would last, he said “two to three more weeks.”</p>
                        <p>When I asked <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName> what he thought
                            about events in Czechoslovakia he answered: “That's the $64.00
                            question.” He deprecated the importance of Soviet military moves, and
                            said he was an optimist about the situation remaining under control. He
                            said he had no information on the Moscow five-nation Summit. We briefly
                            discussed the differences between the present situation in
                            Czechoslovakia and Hungary in 1956—including the fact that Hungary had
                            left the Warsaw Pact and had formed a government with a non-Communist
                            majority. <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName>'s reaction was to
                            recall that the Hungarians in 1956 had also set up placards on the
                            Romanian border demanding the return of Transylvania.</p>

                        <p>Deputy Premier <persName corresp="#p_BA1">Birladeanu</persName> thanked
                            the Secretary and US Government for a well-organized US visit which had
                            been both useful and educational. His hosts throughout the country had
                            been most hospitable and forthcoming. <persName corresp="#p_BA1"
                                >Birladeanu</persName> expressed his satisfaction with the joint
                            statement he and Dr. Hornig had just issued, adding, however, that he
                            considered it to be a declaration of intent rather than a solid
                                program.<note n="2" xml:id="d162fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA1">Birladeanu</persName> was in the United
                                States with a team of six Romanian scientists at the invitation of
                                Donald F. Hornig, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                                    >Johnson</persName>'s Special Assistant for Science and
                                Technology. For text of their joint statement, see Department of

                                178–179.</note> The statement now needs concrete expression.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that the cooperation and hospitality <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA1">Birladeanu</persName> received had been spontaneous
                            and genuine. He considered that the joint statement was a foundation on
                            which a structure of cooperation and practical expression can be built.
                            The Secretary reemphasized the US policy of promoting such
                            cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Commenting further, the Secretary said that this US desire for
                            cooperation with Romania would almost certainly be reaffirmed as
                            national policy by our next President, whoever he is.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BA1">Birladeanu</persName> repeated the Romanian
                            position that a US decision on whether to authorize the sale of a heavy
                            water plant to Romania was of overriding immediate importance to his
                            government, which intended to base its nuclear power complex on a
                            natural uranium-heavy water model.</p>
                        <p>Emphasizing that he was speaking confidentially and off-the-rec-ord, the
                            Secretary said that the outlook for US authorization had improved. He
                            said that he had been personally involved in this matter, as had
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, and that the
                            US Government favored the sale on national policy grounds. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA1">Birladeanu</persName> would understand that there
                            had been sensitive political problems over this issue. Repeating that he
                            was passing this information on a personal basis, the Secretary said
                            that approval now seemed possible before September.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BA1">Birladeanu</persName> asked if the Department
                            of State would support and assist Romania in obtaining medium-sized
                            computers. He stressed that any computers or technology obtained in the
                            United States would be used only in the national economy and that there
                            would be no question of strategic application.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that the Department of Commerce actually approved
                            such applications. He cited a refusal, in which he had concurred, <pb
                                n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0476"/>of authorization of a sale to
                            France on grounds that the equipment in question had almost exclusive
                            application to the French military program. Three agencies—State,
                            Defense, and Commerce—are actually involved. At the Secretary's request
                            for further comments, Mr. Kaplan added that Executive Branch judgments
                            could be made only on the basis of specific applications for export
                            licenses, which we did not yet have. The Secretary said that any US firm
                            that would be involved would understand how to proceed, and he
                            recommended that firm information be provided. Noting that he could not
                            speak for the firms, the Secretary said that he was nevertheless
                            inclined to encourage <persName corresp="#p_BA1">Birladeanu</persName>
                            on this issue unless specific unpredictable problems were to arise.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BA1">Birladeanu</persName> asked the Secretary
                            about expanding opportunities for Romanian students and scientists to
                            study and work in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that <persName corresp="#p_BA1"
                                >Birladeanu</persName>'s question really had two parts. The first is
                            whether the Romanians would be welcome here. The answer would be
                            affirmative, the Secretary said, but <persName corresp="#p_BA1"
                                >Birladeanu</persName> should realize that the US Government could
                            not guarantee acceptances by specific institutions. The Secretary
                            recalled that when he was at the Rockefeller Institute, 80 percent of
                            300-odd foreign applicants wanted to go to Harvard. This was clearly
                            impossible and impractical.</p>
                        <p>The second part of the question is financial. Who pays? The Secretary
                            noted that already-limited US Government funds for exchanges had been
                            cut 25 percent by Congress.</p>
                        <p>He suggested that the Romanians examine possibilities of raising funds on
                            their own. One possibility, for example, would be for the Romanian
                            Government to set aside 10 percent of the income derived from US
                            tourists. It would be a great deal easier for us, the Secretary said, if
                            the Romanians would do something like this and also increase the number
                            of fellowships available for Americans in Romania.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BA1">Birladeanu</persName> said that the Romanian
                            government was prepared to pay some expenses in Romanian currency. He
                            mentioned an earlier conversation in which Chairman Seaborg of the
                            Atomic Energy Commission had suggested that the “Atoms in Action”
                            exhibit could generate hard currency for exchanges of specialists in the
                            nuclear field.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary reiterated our desire to expand exchanges. He noted,
                            however, that the practical problems still needed to be worked out. He
                            cited the possibility that exchanges might be generated in the atomic
                            energy field if the heavy water plant deal is consummated. Romanian
                            specialists would presumably have to come here for training.</p>

                            Czechoslovak situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1"
                                >Bohlen</persName> said that he wanted Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName> to know that the Secretary
                            desired to maintain communication with him whenever conditions
                            warranted. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName>
                            should feel free to call the Secretary directly in case anything
                            warranted such contact.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> asked if the Romanians
                            could confirm rumors of troop movements affecting their country.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName> said he knew
                            nothing of this and had received no information on it. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> asked whether “full
                            mobilization” had taken place in Romania. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName> again replied that he had no word
                            of this.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> said that the
                            world was indignant over the Soviet invasion, and he wondered who, other
                            than the participants and two Asian Communist regimes, actually
                            supported it. In a brief exchange of views about the actual
                            decision-making process in Moscow, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> conjectured that the decision to
                            intervene militarily may have been made at the last moment and on the
                            basis of a plea from Ulbricht and some developments in
                            Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>To a question by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>
                            concerning the Romanian role in the Warsaw Pact, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName> replied that there was no
                            Romanian intention of leaving it. On the contrary, he thought it would
                            be most useful for Romania to remain in the organization.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bogdan</persName> reiterated the
                            Romanian position on the Czechoslovak affair as a “clear-cut stand in
                            which Romania states its firm opposition.” He said that the Romanian
                            leaders had not approached the other Warsaw Pact members about the
                            invasion.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary noted that the Ambassador had asked to see him August 31
                            and inquired whether or not he could take up now the matter for which he
                            had asked for an appointment.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador looked somewhat surprised but said he had been instructed
                            to make an oral communication, a copy of which is attached.<note n="2"

                            said he had been instructed to see either the President or the

                        <p>When the Ambassador had finished his oral statement, the Secretary
                            reminded him that at their last meeting he had referred to disturbing
                            reports in regard to Romania.<note n="3" xml:id="d165fn3">See <ref

                        </p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he had reported his conversation but had received no
                            reply.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we continue to get reports that were disturbing
                            and that in the last 24 hours we had received a number of reports of
                            troop movements, incidents on the frontier, etc. He asked whether the
                            Ambassador had any basis on which he could give him assurances that
                            action against Romania was not intended.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had no official
                            information but that he personally doubted that any such action was
                            contemplated.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that if such action were contemplated, he wished in
                            the name of all humanity to ask that it not be done. The results of such
                            action on world affairs would be incalculable.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> inquired if the
                            Romanians felt the same way. He referred to reports that the Romanian
                            Ambassador had called in the Department.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we had no reports whatever from the Romanians. He
                            wished, however, to underline the gravity of this problem. We were <pb
                                n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0480"/>deeply concerned. He hoped the
                            Ambassador would not misinterpret his moderate manner. Our attitude was
                            based upon well-known principles that had motivated us throughout our
                            history. Our attitude on Czechoslovakia was not related to our bilateral
                            relations with that country which were not particularly good. We
                            believed, however, that every country, large or small, had a right to
                            national existence. We respect that among our <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> allies and we thought the Soviets should respect it
                            among their Warsaw Pact allies. We cannot understand how the state
                            interests of the Soviet Union were involved in any way that would
                            justify military action. Czechoslovakia was not going to leave the
                            Warsaw Pact or join <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and no one was
                            threatening them. We wished to express in strongest terms the
                            expectation that the Soviet Union does not contemplate the further use
                            of military force against any countries of Eastern Europe.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished again to underline the seriousness with
                            which we took the Ambassador's statement to the President on August
                                20<note n="4" xml:id="d165fn4">See <ref target="#d80">Document
                                    80</ref>.</note> and repeated today, that the Soviet Union did
                            not intend in any way to threaten the state interests of the US. He
                            wished to point out that among these interests was Berlin. Frankly, we
                            did not trust Ulbricht. We wished to emphasize the gravity of any move
                            with respect to Berlin in the current situation. He also wished to point
                            out that the thoughts he had expressed carried the authority of the
                            President with whom he had just talked by telephone. The Secretary said
                            he would be available any time, day or night, if the Ambassador had
                            anything to say to him.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked if he could report
                            that he had made his oral statement and that the Secretary would study
                            it and comment later.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed but said he could say now with respect to the
                            reference in the statement to revanchist and imperialist threats to
                            socialist countries that there was no such threat, no <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> plot, there was no intrusion into any
                            of these countries in a manner hostile to the Soviet Union. We could not
                            accept a statement that revanchists or imperialists were carrying out
                            any threat to any of these countries.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> referred to a UPI
                            statement on the ticker and wondered whether this was officially
                            inspired. It had referred to a possible meeting between Kosygin and the
                            President as well as to the effect of Czech developments upon our
                            cultural relations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would have to look at the stories before he could
                            comment but he urged the Ambassador not to confuse any such reports with
                            what he had said to him this evening. He said the President had been
                            trying to make clear our attitudes on Czechoslovakia but he had also
                            wished to keep our options open. The President thought that the <pb
                                n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0481"/>Soviet action against
                            Czechoslovakia was a great mistake on the part of the Soviet Union and
                            that the US respects the right of a small country even though it was one
                            with which our relations were not good, but the President still thinks
                            that there are major problems that need attention. The President had had
                            many phone calls and direct statements made to him that we were not
                            strong enough on Czechoslovakia. If there were additional actions of
                            this kind, it would be a great tragedy. The Secretary said that the
                            American people are pretty mad about the Czechoslovakian affair.
                            Anything that happened between our two great countries could be tragic
                            for the whole world.</p>

                        <p>Reviewing the situation and sequence of events in late August, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that there had been
                            insufficient time for consultation with the Romanian Government prior to
                            his meetings with Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> and the President's speech of August 30. We had
                            had sophisticated information that day which we did not at all like, and
                            our failure to contact the Romanians was surely not intended to be
                            discourteous. The Secretary recalled that the Soviets had come back to
                            us within 24 hours of his August 30 meeting with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> with assurances, for whatever
                            they were worth, that they would not invade Romania.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> reiterated his
                            understanding of this situation and repeated the Romanian Government's
                            appreciation for our efforts. The Secretary told Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> that, in these contacts with the
                            Soviets, we had made completely clear that none of the information on
                            which our concern was based had come from Romanian sources. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> expressed his gratitude, adding
                            that it would have been a matter of considerable concern had such
                            assurances not been given to the Soviets. He reviewed his contacts with
                            Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and Buffum
                            during the late <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0487"/>August–early
                            September period. He said that although the Romanian Government, for
                            understandable reasons of its own, had not published the President's
                            Texas statement of August 30, the Romanian people were well aware of it
                            via foreign radio.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we are not entirely sure of what is on the minds
                            of the Soviet leaders at present. He thought that they may be frightened
                            of their own idea of peaceful coexistence and that they certainly were
                            displaying little understanding of the US motivation in building bridges
                            to the Soviet Union and other countries of Eastern Europe. Against this
                            background, the Secretary said he would refrain from mentioning Romania
                            and Yugoslavia specifically in his October 2 speech before the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, although he intended to mention
                            Czechoslovakia and the important September 26 article in Pravda on the
                            alleged Soviet right to intervene in the affairs of other nations.<note

                            we have categorical assurances from the USSR and prefer, therefore, not
                            to cast public doubt on this in our <gloss target="#t_UNGA1"
                                >UNGA</gloss> statement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> said that the
                            Czechoslovaks had gotten themselves into an impossible position, both
                            domestically and internationally, and had not known what to do. One of
                            the real tragedies of the Czechoslovak situation was that, throughout
                            the Dubcek period since January 1968, the Czechoslovaks had still
                            considered the Soviets to be their best friends. Their euphoric attitude
                            had been very clear during the visit he had made with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Ceausescu</persName> to Prague a short
                            time before the invasion.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that a repeat performance by the Soviets in Romania
                            would elicit a much stronger Western reaction than had been evident in
                            the case of Czechoslovakia. The Secretary said the Romanians had these
                            cards in their hands: 1) the attitude of the Romanian people, 2) the
                            conscience of the Soviets and their Warsaw Pact followers, 3) the fact
                            that an invasion of Romania would risk a fundamental breach of relations
                            between the USSR and the West, and 4) the predictably furious response
                            of world public opinion. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had told him only
                            two weeks before the invasion that the fundamental question for the USSR
                            was the Communist Party leadership in the countries of Eastern Europe.
                            The Secretary added—and Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC1"
                                >Manescu</persName> agreed—that the Romanians posed no problem in
                            this regard.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed US concern over the fact that, for the first time
                            in several years, we did not know what was on the Soviet mind. He found
                            it significant that the Soviet leaders had not spoken out on the Eastern
                            European situation but that the only Soviet reaction had come in <pb
                                n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0488"/>what amounted to anonymous
                            articles. It seems clear that the Soviets continue to want some kind of
                            bilateral relationship with the US, the Secretary said, but they must
                            realize that actions such as those taken toward Czechoslovakia make this
                            extremely difficult. The Soviets, in fact, had specifically asked that
                            nuclear missile talks continue.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether it would be better from the Romanian
                            standpoint to have tensions reduced or to maintain them for an
                            indefinite period. <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> replied
                            that the major issues raised by the Soviet threat should be kept alive
                            while the local situation in Eastern Europe is permitted to calm down.
                            The US, <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> said, must make
                            clear, though not in a cold war spirit, that the Soviets cannot do as
                            they please. The Secretary replied that we have conveyed this message
                            privately and that a judgment as to whether to make a public challenge
                            of it depends on an assessment of whether it would be helpful or
                            not.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> recalled that two
                            prominent Westerners, Foreign Ministers <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Stewart</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HPC1"
                                >Harmel</persName>, had come to Romania since the invasion for
                            long-scheduled visits. He appreciated this and said that normal
                            East-West relations of this type should be maintained.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Buffum asked whether the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia
                            should be a separate agenda item at the UN or whether the subject should
                            be discussed generally. Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC1"
                                >Manescu</persName> replied that it would be neither wise nor useful
                            to try for an agenda item. The Secretary said that, although there would
                            be considerable attention to this subject in the general debate, that
                            there would be problems with a separate item. The Czechoslovaks
                            themselves would oppose it, and many of the other 125 members would take
                            that as a comfortable answer. It would be unwise to have a special item
                            with a bad vote. Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName>
                            was not entirely certain that the vote would be bad but thought that the
                            Czecho-slovak representatives would be placed in an unfavorable position
                            in that they would no longer appear to have the right to resort to UN
                            bodies when an actual need arose.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, speaking personally
                            and privately, informed Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC1"
                                >Manescu</persName> that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DK1"
                                >Duda</persName> had called on him to request that the Soviet
                            invasion not be a special item. <persName corresp="#p_DK1"
                                >Duda</persName> had said that the Czechoslovaks would have more
                            maneuverability if the subject were discussed in more general
                                terms.<note n="3" xml:id="d170fn3">See <ref target="#d95">Document

                            <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> said that the new
                            Czechoslovak Ambassador to the UN, Cernik, had made the same point.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Manescu</persName> said he hoped that the
                            Secretary's scheduled speech of October 2 would not “unleash the dogs of
                            cold war.” The Secretary replied that he would speak with his usual
                            unfailing courtesy. Minister <persName corresp="#p_MC1"
                                >Manescu</persName> said that was what he was afraid of.</p>

                            matter, he touched briefly on the current situation in Eastern Europe.
                            Under Secretary said that rumors of increased military activity in
                            Eastern Europe had come to our attention, that as was his practice he
                            had no wish to make official démarche on basis of rumors and that he
                            would prefer to rely on assurances given Secretary by <persName

                            were questioning assurances of late August in which case he would
                            formally ask Moscow if they were still valid. Under Secretary said he
                            was not questioning assurances and asked if there were any question in
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s mind with regard

                        </p>
                        <p>It is clear that the Soviets are trying to take maximum advantage of the
                            invasion of Czechoslovakia in order to consolidate their hold on Eastern
                            Europe including Romania. The Romanians are under indirect pressure
                            resulting from the logic of the situation, namely that the Soviets are
                            willing to use force in Eastern Europe in order to achieve their
                            objectives. They are also under direct pressure in terms of Soviet
                            demands on a number of important substantive issues (in this connection,
                            we would not be at all surprised if the most recent spate of rumors of
                            an imminent invasion of Romania had not been deliberately encouraged by
                            the Soviets in order to frighten the Romanians into making substantive
                            concessions). The new situation in Eastern Europe has had significant
                            effects on the internal scene where the Romanians are looking for
                            increased support from the population. And, of course, it has also
                            affected foreign policy where, to a limited degree, the Romanians are
                            lying low, although otherwise acting in accordance with the precepts of
                            national communism.</p>

                            Police continue to be on a short leash, there have been several
                            rehabilitations of people sentenced in the 1950's, the emphasis in
                            speeches is on socialist legality, and the latest Grand National
                            Assembly session (November 11–13) passed a new Code of Criminal
                            Procedure which on the face of it is a better guarantee of individual
                            rights than the previous one. In addition, the regime shows every sign
                            of relaxing somewhat its stringent restrictions on travel abroad. In the
                            cultural sphere, although the official line sounds very conservative, in
                            practice the regime seems to be increasingly tolerant of unorthodox art
                            and varying trends in literature. As for the economic sphere, the search
                            for efficiency is no doubt an important factor in the continued quiet
                            work behind the scenes on a limited degree of economic decentralization.
                            Decentralization is also one of the key aspects of the reform of higher
                            education, implemented at the beginning of October, as a result of which
                            the universities and other institutes of higher education will exercise
                            some of the powers previously exercised by the Ministry of
                            Education.</p>
                        <p>No doubt the regime believes that steady (albeit very limited) progress
                            in the direction of internal relaxation will win it a greater measure of
                            popular support. The search for increased support is also behind the
                            recent measures affecting the minorities. Following an <gloss
                                target="#t_RCP1">RCP</gloss> Plenum in October, county and central
                            nationality councils of the Hungarians and the Germans were established.
                            (There are also county, Ukrainian and Serbian councils.) Although their
                            functions have been only vaguely defined in official speeches, this is a
                            gesture of considerable significance. As for the intellectuals,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Ceausescu</persName>'s recent speeches
                            (at the Universities of Cluj and Iasi) showed his concern for their
                            preoccupations and a significant number of intellectuals have been
                            elected to leading positions in the new Front of Socialist Unity which
                            serves to symbolize and (so the regime hopes) to encourage national
                            unity.</p>

                        <p>The attempt of the Soviets to consolidate their hold over the socialist
                            camp is taking place in a number of different contexts.</p>
                        <p>They are trying to “strengthen” or “tighten up” the Warsaw Pact. Although
                            we know very little about the detailed proposals, we have reports of
                            varying reliability that at one time or another the Soviets have
                            demanded integrated military units, more power for the Warsaw Pact
                            Commander-in-Chief, increasing the size of the Romanian Armed Forces,
                            and increasing the standardization of equipment throughout the Warsaw
                            Pact countries. They have also been pressing for Warsaw Pact maneuvers
                            in Romania. The Romanians will probably cooperate to some extent on some
                            of these demands, and Romanian agreement to beefing up or tightening up
                            the Warsaw Pact is in fact a concession since the <pb n="465"
                                xml:id="pg_465" facs="0493"/>Romanians would prefer that there not
                            be any pacts at all in Europe and, short of that, that the Warsaw Pact
                            organization be as quiescent as possible. However, we do not anticipate
                            that the Romanians will be willing to give up national control of their
                            Armed Forces to any significant degree. Certainly, this would be
                            inconsistent with <persName corresp="#p_CN1">Ceausescu</persName>'s
                            categorical rejection in his November 29 speech of any renunciation of
                            sovereignty in the Warsaw Pact context (Bucharest 3174).<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d173fn3">Dated December 2. (Ibid., POL 15–1 ROM)</note>
                            Moreover, we gather that in compensation for their willingness to play
                            along on some matters, the Romanians are pressing for a greater Eastern
                            European voice in Warsaw Pact affairs. As far as maneuvers in Romania
                            go, we have it on very good authority that they have agreed in principle
                            to such maneuvers in 1969, but this agreement is subject to a
                            government-to-government agreement specifying the exact duration and
                            location of the exercise and the size of the forces participating
                            therein.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets and their allies also seem eager once again to try to enhance
                            the authority of <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss>, although here we
                            know even less about their specific proposals. In any event, Romanian
                            opposition to giving <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss> supranational
                            powers was flatly reasserted by <persName corresp="#p_CN1"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> in the speech referred to above.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets have succeeded in obtaining the agreement of many communist
                            parties, including the Romanians, to holding a World Communist
                            Conference in Moscow in May of next year. Romanian agreement to a
                            conference at any specific time is indeed a concession since all along
                            the Romanian argument has been that while a conference is desirable in
                            principle, in practice the conditions are not propitious (this is a
                            reference to the refusal of the Chinese and some other communist parties
                            to have anything to do with it). Perhaps the Romanians felt they could
                            make this concession more readily now that the Italian, Austrian and
                            French <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss>'s had agreed to hold the
                            meeting. In any event, the real measure of Romanian willingness to be
                            conciliatory on this issue is not so much whether they attend a
                            conference as whether they agree to a binding line which would have an
                            adverse effect on their relations with Peking and other communist
                            parties opposed to Moscow or independent of Moscow and on their
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the West in
                            general. The thrust and tone of <persName corresp="#p_CN1"
                                >Ceausescu</persName>'s comments on the world communist movement in
                            his November 29 speech make it very unlikely, in our opinion, that the
                            Romanians would adhere to such a line.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the pattern of Romanian foreign relations continues much as
                            usual. Although in the immediate aftermath of the invasion of
                            Czechoslovakia the Romanians were perhaps sensitive to the visibility of
                            their ties with West Germany, Israel and the United States, at the
                            present <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0494"/>time relations with
                            these three countries are normal and insofar as the United States is
                            concerned they are, if anything, improved. Thus, there is a breakthrough
                            on the issuance of visas for Romanians emigrating to the United States,
                            and the just-signed Cultural and Atomic Energy Agreements and the
                            Agreement with IREX reflect the Romanian desire to expand cultural and
                            scientific relations with us. In addition, negotiations are about to
                            start on a civil air agreement between Romania and the United States.
                            Romanian relations with other countries of the non-communist world are
                            following the usual pattern, and <persName corresp="#p_MC1"
                                >Manescu</persName>'s recent trip to Latin America shows that the
                            Romanians are indeed anxious to further expand them. At the same time,
                            Romanians remain neutral in the Sino-Soviet conflict and maintain their
                            cordial relations with Peking.</p>

                        <p>Romanian national communism has already suffered some setback. This is
                            certainly true to the extent that the Romanians are no longer saying
                            loudly and openly what they really think about Czechoslovakia. It is
                            also true to the extent that the Romanians, as noted above, presumably
                            feel obliged to make some limited concessions of a substantive nature on
                            important bloc issues (e.g. the Warsaw Pact and the World Communist
                            Conference). The Romanian leadership itself, for all <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN1">Ceausescu</persName>'s assertiveness, must be
                            uncertain to what extent it can salvage national communism such as it
                            has developed since the early 1960's. Presumably, they hope that by
                            trimming their sails for a while they will be able to ride out the
                            storm. At this time, and assuming the Soviets do not bring military
                            pressure to bear, we believe that the Romanians will hold on to the
                            fundamentals of independence not only because freedom from control by
                            Moscow is essential doctrine but because <persName corresp="#p_CN1"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> himself cannot afford, if he wishes to
                            maintain his personal ascendancy, to go very far down the road of
                            concessions. In addition, a number of factors are helping the Romanians
                            to keep their noses above water. One of these is the disunity in the
                            communist movement, and the continued opposition of important communist
                            parties to Soviet policy toward Czechoslovakia. Another factor is the
                            absence, so far, of a real revival of the East-West Cold War, the
                            compulsions of which would greatly reduce Romanian freedom of maneuver.
                            And, finally, there is the fact that the Czechs themselves are
                            cooperating to a degree. If there were a bloodbath in Czechoslovakia and
                            the Soviets imposed direct control there, the Romanians would feel under
                            even greater pressure than now.</p>

                                    heavy price must be paid: worsening of relations with

                                    Solution will be acceptable to US in case German people decide
                                    there should be two separate Germanys; also, if they agree two

                                    is taking undue risks by baiting the Soviet Union publicly; that
                                    Rumania should proceed to expand her international ties quietly
                                    and without unnecessarily exciting Soviet apprehension and
                                    animosity; and that if Rumanians continue to develop public
                                    anti-Soviet campaign dangerous consequences might ensue. These
                                    might include: Direct Soviet pressure on Rumania with setback
                                    this would represent to favorable trends in Eastern Europe; a

                                    is infinitely better for themselves (as well as for West) than

                                        >Tito</persName> to intercede with Dej. If so, we believe

                                effectively engaged in effort to prevent developments in Eastern

                                Memoranda of this conversation are ibid.</note> the Yugoslav
                            Ambassador on his initiative called on the Secretary. He pointed out he
                            had spent more than a month in Yugoslavia and had seen President
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJB1">Tito</persName> and many Government
                            officials.</p>
                        <p>The Yugoslav Government considered that relations with the US were
                            normal, correct and good but that they could be even better. No serious
                            political obstacles, as in 1962 or 1963, stood in the way of better
                            relations. Yugoslav officials, however, saw a need for more active
                            relations with the US, for more signs of understanding, for more results
                            and for more contacts between the two Governments. Yugoslavia was
                            interested in placing its relations on the same plane with both East and
                            West.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then raised specific questions in our relations. With
                            reference to prewar Yugoslav debts (bonds), he said that a Yugoslav
                            delegation was now in Washington; negotiations were proceeding
                            satisfactorily and this question would soon be settled definitely.</p>
                        <p>With reference to US claims against Yugoslavia for the nationalized
                            property of US citizens, the Ambassador noted that Yugoslavia had
                            increased its offer from $2 million to $3 million. At informal
                            conversations in Washington recently, the figure of $3.5 million was
                            mentioned. The Ambassador protested that if all the property in question
                            were sold it could not fetch that sum of money. But he said that if the
                            US would accept $3.5 million, our representative could go to Belgrade to
                            negotiate a final settlement at this figure. The Secretary said he was
                            not up-to-date on the details, and the Ambassador replied he was merely
                            informing the Secretary.</p>
                        <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0500"/>
                        <p>With reference to a Fulbright agreement, the Ambassador said that at last
                            both sides were close to an agreement. It might be ready for signature
                            in September. The Yugoslav Government wished to invite Senator Fulbright
                            to visit Yugoslavia for the occasion, and the Yugoslav Embassy was in
                            touch with his office. The Ambassador observed lightly that in this way
                            a new agreement would be ready for signature every month until the end
                            of the year. He hoped that not only the existing atmosphere but also the
                            prospect for future relations would thereby be improved. For example,
                            Yugoslav enterprises wanted to establish more contacts with US private
                            capital.</p>
                        <p>With reference to limitations on Yugoslav cotton textile imports into the
                            US, the Ambassador said negotiations were not going too well. People in
                            Yugoslavia believed that Yugoslavia was being treated worse than other
                            states. The US was offering a quota which was less than the volume of
                            Yugoslav exports to the US in 1962 and 1963. US agreements with other
                            states, such as the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, set quotas
                            which were higher than their exports during those years. The Ambassador,
                            in answer to a question, confirmed that Yugoslav exports had risen in
                            the 1961–1963 period. The Secretary then said that the US had had a
                            gentleman's agreement with Japan on limiting Japanese cotton textile
                            exports to the US during the same period Yugoslav exports were rising.
                            He also reminded the Ambassador that the question of <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> for Yugoslavia had posed a special
                            problem. The US had treated Yugoslavia as a special case, not wanting to
                            limit cotton textile imports from Yugoslavia on account of the <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> problem. It was his understanding that
                            Yugoslavia was being treated as well as other countries. The Ambassador
                            demurred. The Secretary pointed out that if Yugoslavia had had a great
                            increase in exports in 1962, then this would account for a quota lower
                            than the volume of exports in 1962. The Ambassador remarked that the
                            increase in Yugoslav exports was only in the value of a few million
                            dollars and that it was part of the general trend to increase trade
                            between our two countries. It was difficult to explain to Yugoslav
                            enterprises why the US quota had to be lower than the volume of Yugoslav
                            exports in 1962 and 1963, especially since Yugoslavia was not being
                            treated as well as other states. He was hopeful, however, that a
                            satisfactory agreement could be reached.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what the prospects were for agriculture this year.
                            The Ambassador said that until June 15 or 20, wheat looked good but a
                            period of exceptional heat for ten days and nights had seriously
                            affected the crop. He believed his Government would be interested in
                            negotiating for the purchase of more wheat.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to the Rockefeller Foundation's long relationship
                            with Yugoslavia, mostly in the public health field since the war. The
                            Foundation was also interested in the best ways of cultivating basic
                            crops, such as wheat, corn and rice. Some remarkable results had been
                            achieved <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0501"/>in Mexico and
                            Colombia, for example. The Foundation offered cooperation in developing
                            research, training programs and extension services. The Secretary said
                            he did not want to suggest that Yugoslavia was not up-to-date but he
                            thought that, within the framework of scientific and technical contacts,
                            Yugoslavia might be interested in inviting a Rockefeller Foundation
                            member specializing in agriculture to visit Yugoslavia. Such ideas as he
                            might develop might be useful for the Government to look into. The
                            Ambassador thanked the Secretary for this suggestion.</p>

                            that while differences might occur between us arising from differences
                            in political systems he believed we should make every effort to develop
                            those areas where cooperation possible. He referred to aid given by US
                            to Yugoslavia in past, which he termed very useful and important to
                                <gloss target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss>, but felt such aid, while
                            necessary, tended to create difficult relationship. It is wise,
                            therefore, to put such relations on more normal basis.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> said some difficulties or
                            “crises” in our relations had their source in tendency on part of <gloss

                            from that of Moscow. This, he made clear, always manages to raise
                            hackles of <gloss target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss>. He felt <gloss

                            relations which points up importance of his country's relations with US
                            without actually saying so—but following specific reference to situation
                            created by change in Moscow—he intimated that friendly relations with US
                            are of even greater importance now.</p>
                        <p>While agreeing that <gloss target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss> can play
                            important role in helping solve East-West problems, I pointed out that

                            proceeded, nevertheless, to give me his opinion of certain aspects of
                            Soviet developments. He said he felt <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>'s failings were generally those of style;
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was inclined to
                            be heavy-handed and brusque; that his removal was nevertheless a
                            surprise. <persName corresp="#p_KE1">Kardelj</persName> felt that

                                >Kardelj</persName> said he saw no real solution to this problem. He
                            said Sino-Soviet differences had no ideological basis but were, rather,
                            national or political. He felt Soviet Government would make effort to
                            calm matters, but he did not think USSR could possibly make concessions
                            demanded by China. ChiComs would like, of <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475"

                            their own objectives and any détente created thereby would be

                                >Kardelj</persName>'s apparent emphasis on Yugoslavia's need of good

                        <p>The Yugoslavs are seeking financial assistance to support a far-reaching
                            program of economic reform which has been worked out in <pb n="476"
                                xml:id="pg_476" facs="0504"/>close cooperation with the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. Internally the program involves
                            further decentralization of economic decision making to business firms
                            and banks operating in the context of a market economy. Externally it
                            involves devaluation of the currency (dinar) and use of a customs tariff
                            to reduce reliance on quantitative and other administrative measures.
                            The Yugoslavs are concerned that they will not have adequate foreign
                            exchange reserves to carry the program through at the pace and to the
                            degree they desire. Currently their reserves amount to $70 million, or
                            less than one month's imports.</p>
                        <p>The Yugoslavs see as their difficult period the next three and a half
                            years. To support their new program they want to build up their reserves
                            this year to $200 million and by 1968 to $300 million. The attached
                            table shows the details of their requirements and their present plans to
                            finance at least part of them.</p>
                        <p>Briefly, what they have in mind is a package of $150–$160 million
                            basically in new medium and longer-term credits. They are looking to us,
                            Italy, France and the U.K. to provide these new credits. In addition,
                            they are about to get a $50 million net credit from the <gloss

                        <p>The advantages to the U.S. of supporting the program are that it will
                            move the Yugoslav economic system even further towards a typical
                            free-world system and away from the typical Communist system. It will
                            mean closer integration with Free World economic institutions
                            (Yugoslavia hopes the program will enable it to move from provisional
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> membership to full membership)
                            and continue the pressures for liberalization in other aspects of
                            Yugoslav life against more doctrinaire Communists. Success in carrying
                            out the program will have a definite showcase effect in Eastern Europe,
                            where dissatisfaction with the current economic systems and tentative
                            experimentation with reform is widespread.</p>
                        <p>It must be noted, however, that high Yugoslav officials, notably Tito,
                            and the Yugoslav press have sharply criticized in one-sided terms U.S.
                            policies in Viet-Nam, the Dominican Republic and the Congo. The U.S. has
                            vigorously protested this criticism, and the Yugoslavs have been given
                            to understand that it influences what we can do in the economic area.
                            Since these representations were made, public statements by Yugoslav
                            Government officials have been more restrained, and the joint communiqué
                            issued on the occasion of Tito's recent visit to Moscow<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d178fn3">

                            not for withdrawal of U.S. troops. At the same time Yugoslavia has no
                            diplomatic relations with North Viet-Nam, and it has not given that
                            country any kind of material assistance. There have been no
                            demonstrations against the U.S. in Yugoslavia and bilateral relations in
                            the cultural and other fields have increased. In the context of
                            criticism of U.S. foreign policy, Yugoslavia as a dissident Communist
                            country presents a different problem than Pakistan, presumably an ally.
                            Furthermore, Yugoslavia has been absolutely opposed to Chinese policies,
                            especially as they relate to wars of national liberation, and has
                            battled Chinese influence in the Afro-Asian world.</p>
                        <p>Criticism of the U.S. on these matters must be weighed against the
                            advantages to the U.S. of supporting, in pursuit of its long-range
                            objectives, the fundamental movement towards economic liberalization and
                            closer affinity to Western practices inherent in the Yugoslav program
                            and the significance of this movement in enabling Yugoslavia to continue
                            its role as the envied revisionist and historical disruptor of Communist
                            unity. The financial support which the U.S. is being asked to provide
                            for the reform program is relatively small—namely, less than $17 million
                            a year. More importantly, this support is not in the form of grant “aid”
                            but <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0506"/>only of extending better
                            terms on credit facilities, all of which are repayable in dollars.</p>
                        <p>In my judgment, this contribution would not give us sufficient leverage
                            to compel the Yugoslavs to change further their public statements on our
                            military policies in Viet-Nam, since I believe that under existing
                            circumstances it is in the U.S. interest to continue our normal dollar
                            repayable <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 program. Therefore I
                            recommend that the U.S. support to the moderate extent indicated the
                            Yugoslav program for greater economic integration with the Free
                            World.</p>

                        <p>We have invested 3–1/2 billion since 1950 in Tito's Yugoslavia. This

                            <persName corresp="#p_TJB1">Tito</persName>'s defection started the
                            dissolution of the Communist Bloc. It led to riots in Poland, revolution
                            in Hungary, and a new sense of national independence throughout Eastern
                            Europe. Your program of building bridges to the East takes advantage of
                            the forces that Yugoslavia's independence set in motion.</p>
                        <p>Yugoslavia is now taking far-reaching and equally risky steps in the
                            economic field. It is moving toward a market economy tied to the free
                            world. It has reduced its tariffs, abolished import quotas and is now a
                            full member of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. Economic
                            liberalization in Yugoslavia is already setting the pattern for other
                            countries in Eastern Europe. It is in our interest to make it
                            succeed.</p>
                        <p>For this reason, the agricultural sales program we recommend would be a
                            good investment. The proposed sale of vegetable oils and wheat amounts
                            to $40 million. These credit sales would give the Yugoslav Government
                            badly needed room to maneuver and help it deal with the balance of
                            payment pressures that result from import liberalization. These dollar
                            repayable credits would greatly encourage the Yugoslavs to <pb n="480"

                            trading with Cuba, except for agricultural products as to which a
                            Presidential waiver would be possible.</p>
                        <p>Yugoslavia does not trade with North Viet-Nam and is the only Communist
                            nation which does not do so. It does, however, permit small shipments of
                            medical supplies and blood, collected through voluntary contribution to
                            its Red Cross (a non-governmental organization). It is the view of the
                            Department of Justice that these shipments would not, as a matter of
                            law, preclude <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 aid.</p>
                        <p>Yugoslavia also does a small amount of business with Cuba in
                            non-agriculture commodities and, therefore, <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                >PL</gloss> 480 assistance after January 1 will be prohibited.</p>
                        <p>The wheat sales here recommended were under discussion between the United
                            States and the Government of Yugoslavia prior to the amendment of <gloss
                                target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 although no formal commitments were
                            entered into. We have a signed agreement to sell the vegetable oil. If
                            we are to go ahead with these sales, however, it would be important as a
                            matter of law that they be approved prior to January 1. In addition, we
                            agree that the sale of wheat should not be approved by you formally
                            without discussion with key members of the Agriculture Committee so that
                            there could be no misunderstanding with respect to the applicability of
                            the amendments to <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480. We would ask
                            for your approval, therefore, subject to our straightening out any
                            possible misunderstandings in Congress.</p>

                                the war in Vietnam. It was one of a series of demonstrations and
                                attacks on U.S. Government facilities in Yugoslavia during December

                                The Yugoslav Government denounced the attacks as the work of
                                anti-Tito emigres.</note> Question arises therefore of policy and
                            intentions both governments. Need clarification future prospects.</p>
                        <p>3. Secretary replied bombings outrageous and unfortunate. He had asked
                            Under Secretary to keep in close touch with Department Justice regarding
                            progress investigation. There have been no arrests yet but results not
                            completely blank and these must be checked out carefully. He stressed
                            FBI has committed full facilities to investigation. <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> must make clear its attitude toward
                            such incidents very severe, even aside from US-Yugoslav relations, since
                            it affects 118 countries with which we have relations. We will try keep
                            Yugoslavs informed further developments.</p>
                        <p>4. On Zagreb demonstrations Secretary said these also unfortunate and he
                            did not wish contradict what US authorities had said earlier. Although
                            we have feeling that demonstrations could have been prevented and their
                            effect should not be underestimated, they have not produced permanent
                            injury to our relations as far as President and Secretary concerned and
                            have not affected <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> thinking.</p>
                        <p>5. Secretary recalled Executive Branch had vigorously opposed legislation
                            eliminating Yugoslav eligibility Food for Peace sales and law <pb

                            Outcome result of psychology over Vietnam in Congress. Secretary said he
                            not aware any negative changes in <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            attitude toward Yugoslavia and emphasized our hope to further develop
                            relations. As example, cited hope both countries would have success in
                            Kennedy Round.</p>
                        <p>6. Secretary said debt roll-over not easy but we continue active
                            consideration. One problem is fact US called upon play major, often
                            almost single, role in assistance many countries, e.g. food for India.
                            With huge budget before Congress this year, <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> concerned about what other countries doing in
                            assistance field.</p>
                        <p>7. Secretary emphasized <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would very
                            much like to see Yugoslav economic reform succeed and wishes to help.
                            Problem for us is not one of policy but rather limited possibilities for
                            action by other agencies as to amount of burdens other countries they
                            can assume.</p>
                        <p>8. Answering Secretary's question what <persName corresp="#p_MV1"
                                >Micunovic</persName> considers major bilateral problems, latter
                            expressed satisfaction Department's actions on damages resulting from
                            bombing. In eyes Yugoslav Government, public and press there can be no
                            question <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> good will but violence
                            against Yugoslav missions must be eliminated and FBI investigation must
                            be successful. Secretary replied FBI actively working on available
                            information but there is difference in possibility of action toward
                            those involved in such acts as bombing and those politically opposed to
                            Yugoslav regime. <persName corresp="#p_MV1">Micunovic</persName> said he
                            referred only to acts of violence. Yugoslav missions in US can no longer
                            operate under “reign of terror.”</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_MV1">Micunovic</persName> said <gloss

                            <item>Yugoslavia is a Communist state in name and in theory, but in
                                practice it is a fully independent state which has rejected most of
                                the “socialist” experience of other Communist states, including the
                                USSR. It has deliberately removed a large portion of its economy
                                from direct centralized controls, and despite its retention of a
                                one-party political system, it has largely freed its people from
                                arbitrary authority.</item>

                            <item>The Yugoslav experiment appears to be progressing satisfactorily.
                                Since the break with Stalin nearly 20 years ago, the Yugoslavs have
                                managed to build a viable and independent economy, to go a good
                                distance down the road to decentralization and the democratization
                                of public institutions, and to establish a position in world affairs
                                considerably more significant than their power and resources would
                                seem to warrant. Although the trend toward further decentralization
                                is probably irreversible, progress will not be smooth, and change in
                                Yugoslavia will continue to be accompanied by dissension over the
                                structure and role of party and government, over the nationalities
                                problem, and over the speed with which market forces will be
                                introduced into the economy.</item>
                            <label>C.</label>
                            <item>The greatest problem the Yugoslav Communist Party is likely to
                                face is arranging an orderly succession to the 74-year-old <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TJB1">Tito</persName>. Should the succession problem
                                arise during a period of severe internal stress and before current
                                reforms have become institutionalized, a serious struggle might
                                ensue. There is a remote chance that such a struggle could threaten
                                the cohesiveness of the Federation, but we believe it far more

                                count on fresh memories of war and the German occupation to help
                                generate a feeling of national unity. After 1948 and the break with
                                the USSR, the regime could rely on common concern over the Soviet
                                threat to perpetuate this unity. In recent years, however, arbitrary

                                reemerging particularization in typical fashion, by limited
                                concession and compromise. Much recent sound and fury on the
                                nationalities problem stemmed from non-Serb fears that Rankovic,
                                given as he was to packing party organs and the police with his
                                fellow Serbs, might someday bring about a return of Serb hegemony.
                                His purge probably did much to allay such fears, and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TJB1">Tito</persName>, in his post-Rankovic
                                reorganization of the party, was careful to afford the Republics a
                                more balanced representation in top party organs. In January 1967,
                                the Federal Assembly's Chamber of Nationalities met for the first
                                time in many years—an indication, perhaps, of the growing
                                seriousness of the nationalities problem—and heard proposals for a
                                constitutional amendment which would grant it equal rights with the
                                Federal Council, now the most powerful parliamentary body. <persName

                                the Chamber of Nationalities he can establish a safe and
                                controllable forum for the expression of particularist
                                sentiment.</item>

                                large numbers of younger men into the party and governmental organs
                                of the individual Republics; he may thus hope to contribute to a
                                weakening of the particularist idea. Though the sentiments on which
                                they feed are widespread and of longstanding, the extremist segments
                                of the particularist movement remain relatively small and—by their
                                very nature—disunited. Younger men of the establishment, bred in an
                                independent Yugoslavia, are likely to believe that the economic and
                                political values of a unified federation outweigh the emotional
                                appeal of secession. So far, this stratagem appears to be working.
                                Many of the newer men, even some of those who were once outspoken in
                                their advocacy of greater regional autonomy, have developed vested
                                interests in the status quo and have become defenders of the federal
                                concept now that they bear heavier administrative responsibility in
                                the upper councils of party and governmental organizations. Many
                                will continue to exploit the emotional appeal of particularism in
                                dealing with their public supporters, but most are likely to
                                submerge the issue in their approach to the solution of national

                                ethnic animosity, however, will continue to plague <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TJB1">Tito</persName>, and it could represent a
                                significant hazard to a less certain, less prestigious successor.
                                The emotional content of this question almost certainly means that
                                it will remain a potentially explosive issue for some years to come,
                                one susceptible to exploitation by ambitious politicians. Or the
                                people themselves, if dissatisfied and frustrated, could come to see
                                in the federal structure the cause of their own discontents. On
                                balance, however, we foresee a slow attenuation of particularist
                                strength and the gradual invigoration of the Yugoslav idea,
                                particularly among those whose livelihoods and sensibilities would

                                Belgrade to the Republics and to local governmental units has been a
                                parallel diffusion of power within the Communist Party, from central
                                organs to regional ones. Local party leaders have not always
                                followed central party directives; they have frequently found
                                themselves torn between the demands of party discipline and the
                                imperatives of local policy decisions. The result has more often
                                than not been detrimental to the party: factionalism has grown and
                                has often reflected particularist divisions; unions, workers'
                                councils, local party groups, enterprise managers' associations, and
                                the like have become new loci of power, and contention and debate
                                have become chronic. All this has been particularly troublesome in a
                                system which was designed to depend so heavily on a unified and
                                disciplined party—with personnel and organizational lines into all
                                other groups and institutions—to provide the centralized authority

                                decentralization and political liberalism, and in doing so had
                                played upon Serbian nationalism and had accumulated state power
                                (including control of the secret police) to a dangerous

                                of the most powerful conservatives by assigning them to a 35-man
                                Presidium which is limited to policy guidance. He has specified that
                                the revived Central Committee must deliberate in public view,
                                eliminating the secrecy which had aided Rankovic in his accumulation
                                of power. He has reconstituted the formerly all-powerful Executive
                                Committee with younger, less prominent men charged with implementing
                                the Presidium's decisions. Finally, he has packed party leadership
                                organs on both Federal and Republic levels with new faces: new men
                                in the party leadership now outnumber the old by 2 to 1, and the

                                Very few of Rankovic's followers were purged, and Rankovic himself
                                was not subjected to criminal prosecution, although the evidence

                                role of the party within Yugoslav government and society. Is the
                                party to exercise command and control or merely ideological
                                guidance? <persName corresp="#p_TJB1">Tito</persName>'s position is
                                ambivalent. He exhorts the party to lead by persuasion rather than
                                command, but makes it unmistakably clear that the party's role “is
                                growing and will increase for a long time.” He has reduced the power
                                of the secret police by greatly restricting its activities and
                                cutting back its manpower, and he has expanded the rosters of
                                leadership organs so that it will be a “little more difficult for an
                                individual to stand out much.” At the same time, he has insisted
                                that the “party will not wither away,” that it is “still a
                                revolutionary party” and that it has “the right to apply all means
                                necessary to protect the society, to protect the correct line of …
                                socialist development.”</item>

                                “democratization” and decentralization. The regime will seek to

                                moderate men for Republic and Federal Cabinet positions. Executive
                                decisions will probably more and more fall to men capable of

                            <item>Yugoslavia began its lonely journey down the path of economic
                                revisionism some 15 years ago. Since then, government economic
                                policy has been to allow some considerable play of market forces,
                                though government controls have never been fully relinquished and
                                have been tightened in time of stress. The net result has been a
                                respectable growth rate of about seven percent annually in gross
                                national product, excessive and frequently unwise investment in
                                industrial expansion, some growth in consumption, and a chronic
                                deficit in the nation's balance of payments.<note n="7"
                                    xml:id="d183fn7">In 1964, for example, Yugoslavia's balance of
                                    payments deficit was $206 million. In 1965 and 1966, new
                                    controls cut the annual deficit to about $21 million. [Footnote

                                been forthcoming, and Yugoslav indebtedness to the West now amounts
                                to about $1.2 billion. The recent devaluation of the dinar and moves
                                to facilitate the influx of foreign capital are likely to impress
                                potential foreign investors favorably. At the same time, Yugoslavia
                                has managed to keep her economy free from reliance on the Bloc, and
                                although the USSR is Yugoslavia's single largest trade partner,
                                two-thirds of her foreign trade is with Western or nonaligned

                            <item>The most recent swing of Yugoslav economic policy began in 1965,
                                and like its predecessors, it has not been implemented without
                                opposition. Political conservatives are undoubtedly concerned at any
                                further decentralization, any lessening of the party's role in the
                                decision-making process. Managers of less efficient enterprises are
                                unhappy at the prospect of forgoing state protectionism and facing
                                the harsh winds of foreign competition. Trade unions and workers in
                                such enterprises have similar fears, and cannot relish the prospect
                                of unemployment should their inefficient organizations fail and go
                                out of business, as a number already have. Consumers, who may some
                                day benefit the most from movement toward a market economy, in the

                                Yugoslav economy is unstable and probably will remain so unless the
                                market forces now being brought into play come to constitute a
                                regulatory mechanism reliable enough to replace the centralized
                                direction which in the past characterized Yugoslav economic
                                control.</item>

                                compromises. He has strengthened the financial resources of a number
                                of enterprises by cutting their taxes, by permitting them to retain
                                a major portion of their profits for investment, and by largely
                                localizing the control of credit. At the same time, he has
                                threatened the lash of foreign competition by eliminating import
                                controls on fully half the goods Yugoslavia imports and by bringing
                                Yugoslavia into full membership in <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                    >GATT</gloss>. He has not obstructed freer movements of capital
                                investment and labor to needy sectors of the economy, but he is
                                maintaining Federal control of a major portion of the price
                                structure and 30 to 40 percent of investment capital. He has
                                permitted labor to organize outside the direct control of the party,
                                to play a significant role in enterprise management, and to gain
                                inflationary wage increases. (There were a surprising 230 strikes,
                                mostly on wage issues, in 1965 alone.) He has tried to meet the
                                challenge of growing unemployment by encouraging the exportation of
                                Yugoslav labor, and he has maintained extensive although indirect
                                control on consumer consumption.</item>

                                down to the level of the Opstina (township), have demonstrated great

                                foreign policy goals have been to retain Yugoslav independence at
                                any cost, to stand as a model of nonaligned socialist enterprise in
                                the eyes of the world, and to achieve access to economic opportunity
                                in both East and West. His methods for achieving these goals, marked
                                by clever improvisation and shrewd compromise, have been largely
                                successful. He has rejected alliance with either East or West and
                                gotten substantial aid from both. He has denied Soviet hegemony in
                                the socialist movement and lived to see that denial become something
                                of a touchstone of socialist policy. He has accepted financial aid
                                from the West in wholesale quantities, but has politely bid the West
                                goodnight on the doorstep. He has failed in his efforts to establish
                                the “third world” grouping he once sought, but he has redirected
                                Yugoslav diplomatic energies to Europe, and this has brought him new
                                opportunities without destroying his close relationships with the

                                Soviet Union soon after Stalin's death. Trade is large, the Soviets
                                have extended a fair amount of aid (including sales of military
                                equipment), and attitudes toward many international problems are
                                similar, though usually not identical. Nevertheless, party relations
                                are often strained and marked by ideological bickering.
                                    <persName>Tito</persName> has never ceased to see himself as a
                                Communist, a protestant perhaps, but still defender of the faith. In
                                his view, it was Soviet recusancy, not Yugoslav, which split the
                                socialist movement, and <persName>Tito</persName> must feel some
                                considerable sense of vindication in the fact that other Eastern

                                economic experiment and are choosing national roads to socialism. So

                                within the socialist camp, the Soviet Union will carp and nag; so
                                long as Soviet attacks continue to arouse Yugoslav fears for their
                                independence from foreign meddling, Soviet-Yugoslav relations will
                                be much more a matter of mutual convenience than affection.</item>

                                to seek US aid after the break with the USSR in 1948 remains the
                                touchstone of the Yugoslav attitude. The hostility which Yugoslav
                                exiles in the US bear toward the Belgrade government is always a
                                potential source of friction, especially when it is periodically
                                reflected in US legislation. But the Yugoslavs recognize the
                                usefulness of a continuing measure of US political and economic
                                support, and they do not allow themselves to be easily provoked.
                                Nevertheless, on most of those issues which clearly polarize the
                                world, the Yugoslavs will not forget their Communist antecedents and
                                will pay at least lip-service to Communist positions.</item>

                                Partly this is because of the opportunity presented by relaxed
                                tensions in Europe; partly it is designed as a defensive hedge
                                against any future Soviet attempts at domination. Relations with
                                Hungary and Bulgaria (despite friction with the latter over
                                Macedonia) have significantly improved as Budapest and Sofia have
                                begun to display signs of independence within the Bloc. Even more
                                improvement has occurred in relations with Rumania; Belgrade and
                                Bucharest have found common ground in their resistance to Soviet
                                pressures and are now in a de facto alliance intended to strengthen
                                and preserve their independence. Not surprisingly, Albania—allied

                                interdependence, the Yugoslav economy will probably become enmeshed
                                in the same process.</item>

                            <item>A number of factors favor an orderly succession: though still
                                evolving, the Yugoslav system as a whole has withstood the attacks
                                of party factions, the stresses of economic crisis, and the
                                importunities of separatists. The army continues to provide support
                                for national unity, and fear of Soviet piracy will work to inhibit
                                the adventuresome who might be tempted to steer a new course
                                following the dropping of the pilot. While <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TJB1">Tito</persName> cannot lay out a fixed path
                                for a successor regime to follow, he may have established a pattern
                                and style, a reliance on the empiric and the experimental, which a
                                successor would probably want to imitate and which, in any case, he
                                would find difficult to abandon. Much will depend, however, on when
                                the succession takes place. Should it occur before <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TJB1">Tito</persName> has accomplished the pending
                                reorganization of the state and party structures, at a time of
                                severe economic regression, or at a time when dissension among the
                                Republics is high, serious struggle might ensue. The outcome of such
                                a struggle is difficult to foresee. It is remotely possible that a
                                concatenation of such unfavorable events could endanger the cohesion
                                of the Federation. But we believe it far more likely that the state
                                would survive intact. On the other hand, should the succession issue
                                arise after recent reforms have become institutionalized, a
                                relatively united leadership could, without serious crisis, choose a
                                replacement or, more likely, agree on some form of collective
                                leadership.</item>
                            <label>34.</label>
                            <item>We believe that, over the long term, the principal accomplishments
                                of the Yugoslav system are fairly secure, that Yugoslavia, even
                                without <persName corresp="#p_TJB1">Tito</persName>, will survive
                                essentially intact and will persist as a hybrid system. We also
                                think, however, that change and disarray will continue to confront
                                the leadership—especially the post-<persName corresp="#p_TJB1"
                                    >Tito</persName> leadership—with a variety of serious problems.
                                The destination of the Yugoslav regime, said to be a new and
                                superior kind of “socialism,” is vague and uncertain, and the route
                                toward it uncharted. None of the forces released by the Titoist
                                reformation is likely to prevail without a struggle; changes of this
                                nature generate formidable opposition. Separatist sentiments are
                                likely to weaken the Federation; both pragmatic and ideological
                                considerations will probably operate to diminish the power of the
                                party; and economic forces, increasingly decentralized, will almost
                                certainly encourage nonparty institutions to play a larger role in
                                shaping national policy.</item>

                        <p>From July through September 1967, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"

                                >Tito</persName> exchanged a series of letters concerning the crisis
                            in the Middle East. The exchange was initiated by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJB1">Tito</persName> at a July 27 meeting with Chief
                            Justice Earl Warren at which he gave Warren a message for the President.
                            Tito's approach was prompted by the June “Six-Day War” between Israel
                            and a coalition of Arab states. The <persName corresp="#p_TJB1"

                            correspondence concerned the possible terms of a settlement of the
                            Arab-Israeli conflict. Copies of the correspondence are in the Johnson

                        <p>146. 1. During meeting with FonMin <persName corresp="#p_NM1"
                                >Nikezic</persName> yesterday, I raised question of our bilateral
                            relations. In much the same vein as conversation with Amb Crnobrnja day
                            before (Belgrade's 140)<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2">Dated July 14.
                                (Ibid.)</note> I referred to atmosphere of mistrust and apprehension
                            which seemed to permeate Yugoslav officialdom and press and increasing
                            tendency to regard <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> as deus ex
                            machina responsible for world events which seem to have raised so much
                            alarm here. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had shown in many ways
                            its desire to maintain good relations with Yugoslavia and I was
                            constantly being assured here that <gloss target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss>
                            was similarly interested in good relations. Repetition of charges re ”US
                            aggression” and ”US imperialism” in official utterances and press,
                            however, could hardly advance this objective. I pointed to history of
                            US-Yugoslav relations since 1948 which should have convinced Yugoslavs
                            of sincerity of our intentions. US public cannot fail to be aware <pb
                                n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0526"/>of present Yugoslav attitude
                            toward US and this in turn could affect whole scale of our
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>2. Nicezic said that many factors were involved in formulation of public
                            and official opinion which in turn affect conduct of foreign policy. He
                            was fully aware of points I had made and said <gloss target="#t_FonOff1"
                                >FonOff</gloss> frequently found itself in position of trying to
                            moderate government's views in much the same way as State Dept is
                            required to do from time to time. Recent events in world, culminating in
                            Greek coup d'etat and ME crisis had alarmed many people in Yugoslavia,
                            however, and caused conclusions to be drawn which may or may not be
                            fully justified. He spoke about Greece particularly, noting that new
                            Greek Govt is noisily anti-Communist and has indulged in various actions
                            which would not indicate any desire to maintain good relations with
                            Yugoslavia. <gloss target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss> on other hand wished to
                            maintain good relations with all neighboring states. It is assumed here
                            therefore that for reasons intimately connected with its effort to
                            remain in power Greek Govt deliberately fosters illusion of threat from
                            Communist neighbors. Over and above this there is some reason to suspect
                            that Greece might have designs on Albania which, of course, would be of
                            vital interest to Yugoslavia. I tried to dissuade him from this line of
                            thinking, observing that preoccupation with internal affairs should make
                            it obvious that Greece is in no position or mood to carry out foolhardy
                            military adventures.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NM1">Nikezic</persName> was very affable and
                            frank throughout our conversation. He said present atmosphere which I
                            had commented on and which he also deplored as affecting adversely
                            relations with the US would doubtless begin to be dispelled with
                            settlement of Middle Eastern problem. He expressed an interest in seeing
                            me again before I leave for Washington and before he departs on a
                            month's holiday.</p>

                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> welcomed
                            Ambassador Crnobrnja and recalled his friendly and fruitful association
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_TJB1">Tito</persName> which had
                            begun during the Second World War. The Governor next discussed his
                            previous meeting with Ambassador Crnobrnja which had taken place in 1965
                            when Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> visited
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJB1">Tito</persName> at Brioni and Ambassador
                            Crnobrnja was Secretary General to <persName corresp="#p_TJB1"

                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> then expressed
                            appreciation of Yugoslavia's initiative and effort directed at
                            encouraging movement toward a Near East settlement.<note n="3"

                        </p>
                        <p>The Governor then commented on the very significant role Yugoslavia had
                            played in shaping the course of relations between countries in the
                            Socialist Camp. In this connection, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                                >Harriman</persName> regarded the terms under which Yugoslavia
                            reentered into normal relations with the USSR in 1956 as equally
                            significant politically as Tito's break with Stalin in 1948. Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> expanded on this by
                            saying that the terms of Yugoslavia's reentry into normal relations with
                            the USSR were Yugoslavia's terms of independence—political, military,
                            economic and ideologic, and that the pattern of these has increasingly
                            set the pattern for relations desired by other Eastern European
                            countries with the USSR.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Crnobrnja was obviously pleased to hear this. He then asked
                            the Governor's opinion regarding the thesis being put forward in <pb
                                n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0528"/>some quarters that, as US–USSR
                            relations develop favorably, US interest in Yugoslavia declines.</p>
                        <p>The Governor answered that this thesis was wrong. He said that favorable
                            development of US-Soviet relations increased opportunities for better
                            relations between the US and Yugoslavia as well as between the US and
                            other Eastern European countries. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                                >Harriman</persName> explained that Yugoslavia, as a member of the
                            Socialist Camp, was more or less obliged to side with the <gloss
                                target="#t_U1">U</gloss>SSR when major issues arose between the US
                            and the USSR. The Governor continued that, in such instances,
                            US-Yugoslav relations could suffer setbacks.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Crnobrnja immediately protested that, on issues between the US
                            and the USSR, Yugoslavia had been entirely free and would remain
                            entirely independent in making up its mind.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Crnobrnja went on to say that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJB1">Tito</persName> had stressed the hope to him just
                            before his departure for Washington that the US and the USSR would
                            always appreciate the extraordinary responsibilities they shared
                            regarding the vastly destructive weapons in their hands.</p>
                        <p>The Governor answered that this was very much the case and that Glassboro
                            and the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> were evidences of mutual
                            US–USSR concern in this regard.<note n="4" xml:id="d186fn4">For

                            Russians would again want to face a showdown of the sort they brought
                            upon themselves by their Cuban gamble.</p>
                        <p>When the conversation turned to Viet-Nam, Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> emphasized the very large
                            turnout for the recent elections in South Viet-Nam.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d186fn5">September 4.</note> He also expressed the hope that
                            Yugoslavia would use its best offices to encourage meaningful
                            negotiations directed at ending the conflict.</p>
                        <p>When the subject of Yugoslav-<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                            relations arose, Ambassador Crnobrnja said that the door was open
                            unconditionally on the Yugoslav side for resumption of diplomatic
                            relations. Ambassador Crnobrnja indicated that there had been some talks
                            on this subject and that the ball was in Bonn's court.</p>
                        <p>At the close, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                            said that, although he did not have any day to day operating
                            responsibility connected with US-Yugoslav relations, he would always be
                            ready to receive Ambassador Crnobrnja should matters arise on which he
                            might be interested.</p>
                        <p>Before saying good-bye, the Governor showed Ambassador Crnobrnja some
                            photographs in his office which had been taken with President <persName

                            <item>It would appear from uncleared memcon covering your talk with
                                Ambassador Crnobrnja on December 22 that latter attempted to place
                                onus on US for stagnation of our bilateral relations in 1967. It is
                                true that certain developments have caused Yugoslavs to sense in
                                recent US policy a growing disinterest in Yugoslavia. Nevertheless,
                                Crnobrnja must recognize that maintenance of good relations is not
                                unilateral proposition and that course of our relations in year just
                                ending cannot be disassociated from exceedingly hostile attitude

                                Viet-Nam, on which they have maintained well-orchestrated anti-US
                                campaign. <persName corresp="#p_TJB1">Tito</persName> himself used

                                Yugoslav officials the harmful effect of this to friendly public
                                attitude on our bilateral relations and its incompatibility with
                                their frequently expressed desire for better relations with

                            <item>Given our long-range objectives, US administration has (rightly in
                                my view) maintained steadfast course toward Yugoslavia despite
                                differing views on international issues. Fact of matter, however, is
                                that Yugoslavia's antagonistic posture toward US policies and
                                activities abroad has not gone unnoticed in Congress. Congressional
                                concern with Viet-Nam, as well as Cuba, has inevitably affected
                                Yugoslavia which does conduct a small degree of trade with Cuba and
                                which is (to the best of our knowledge) sending only plasma and
                                medical supplies and equipment to the North Vietnamese and, through

                                demonstrated a good deal of forbearance on our part. During this

                            <item>For the immediate future, I believe that the most promising areas
                                for an expansion and enrichment of our relations lie in fields of
                                commercial activities, including private investment in Yugoslavia,
                                and increased scientific, technical and cultural exchanges. We have
                                already made effort to advance our commercial relations by exchange
                                of trade delegations and it would be useful not [now?] to
                                investigate possibilities of US private investment here as well as
                                industrial cooperation between US and Yugoslavia business
                                enterprises. At same time, I have advised appropriate Yugoslav
                                officials that the attraction of American buyers and investors to
                                Yugoslavia is responsibility of Yugoslavs themselves and they cannot
                                depend on others to do their selling job for them.</item>

                            Katzenbach's memo recommending that you determine it is in the national
                            interest for the Export-Import Bank to extend credits, guarantees, and
                            insurance for U.S. exports to Yugoslavia. If you make this finding, you
                            should also sign the attached draft letters notifying the
                            Congress./2/</p>
                        <p>Harold Linder concurs in this recommendation.</p>
                        <p>You have already made this determination for Yugoslavia for Export-Import
                            Bank guarantees. This determination has been required since 1964 under
                            the Foreign Aid and Related Agencies Appropriation Act. Since that time,
                            the Export-Import Bank has extended guarantees on $66 million of U.S.
                            exports to Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>A new determination is now needed because of the Tower-Hickenlooper
                            amendment to the Export-Import Act of 1968. This amendment prohibits
                            Export-Import Bank participation in transactions involving communist
                            countries unless the President determines it is in the national
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>Under the Tower-Hickenlooper amendment, your finding in favor of
                            Yugoslavia would permit the Export-Import Bank to extend credits as well
                            as guarantees. Under the Appropriations Act only guarantees are
                            permitted. The legal question of which act takes precedence is open. If
                            you make the national determination in favor of Yugoslavia, the
                            Export-Import Bank would consult with the House Appropriations Committee
                            before making a loan (rather than guaranteeing a loan) under the broader
                            provisions of the Tower-Hickenlooper amendment.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> has concluded that the
                            Fino amendment—which prohibits Export-Import Bank financing on
                            transactions with any country whose government supplies goods or
                            services to North Vietnam—is not applicable to Yugoslavia. This
                            conclusion is supported by the legislative history. Fino said on the
                            House floor that his amendment would not affect Yugoslavia.</p>

                            arguments for continuing Export-Import Bank financing for Yugoslavia. In
                            brief, it is good foreign policy and good business.</p>
                        <p>Bill Macomber said that he does not expect any significant fuss on the
                            Hill. Neither does Linder.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Crnobrnja called on <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">John
                                Leddy</persName> June 6 and raised two subjects related to
                            US-Yugoslav relations:</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador is still unhappy about the fact that Governor Reagan
                            proclaimed April 10 as “Croatian Independence Day.” After the Ambassador
                            first raised this with you, Win Brown wrote to Reagan pointing out the
                            unfortunate connotation of April 10 which was the anniversary of the
                            establishment of the Nazi puppet state in Croatia. We have not heard
                            from Governor Reagan but we told Crnobrnja that we had information to
                            the effect that Americans of Yugoslav origin in California <pb n="505"
                                xml:id="pg_505" facs="0533"/>have been making their displeasure at
                            this action known to the Governor.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador also raised the question of issuing a U.S. visa to former
                            King Peter of Yugoslavia. He complained that <persName corresp="#p_PJ1"
                                >Peter</persName> makes unfortunate political statements about
                            Yugoslavia whenever he visits this country. Crnobrnja asked that we not
                            issue <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> another visa.</p>
                        <p>We have looked into this visa question. While there is no reason for us
                            to deny a visa to former King <persName corresp="#p_PJ1"
                                >Peter</persName>, he has on occasion disregarded our admonition to
                            avoid political statements while in the United States as a temporary
                            visitor for pleasure. Although some of his statements have caused us
                            embarrassment in our relations with Yugoslavia, they have on the whole
                            been relatively moderate. Further we have no evidence that <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName> is planning a trip at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>The Yugoslav Ambassador explained his approach on both of these subjects
                            as stemming from a desire to improve U.S./Yugoslav relations and
                            requested that we bring these points to your attention and also to the

                                early to provide any details because delegation was still on Brioni
                                (he had talked to them only by telephone) and <gloss

                                        goodwill toward Yugoslav delegation were enormous. Visit
                                        represented culmination Yugoslav efforts to assist
                                        Czechoslovakia. Yugoslav position at Prague was extremely
                                        delicate, primarily because one of purposes of visit was to
                                        assist Czechs whose position vis-é-vis Moscow also was most
                                        delicate. Yugoslavs were at great pains to do nothing or say
                                        nothing at Prague that could provide even slightest pretext
                                        for direct intervention on part of Soviets or complicate
                                        Dubcek's life any more than it now is. Visit originally had
                                        been planned to take place under different circumstances;
                                        thus, visit had different scope and purpose; even so it was
                                        useful. Yugoslavs and Czechs both pleased.</item>

                                        Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia is not interested
                                        in any such arrangements, its past experience in this field

                                        implementation of reforms and party program in preparation
                                        for Party Congress next month. They must have time to do
                                        this; this is dependent upon internal strength of Party
                                        leadership and its willingness to face up to serious
                                        problems. We should not expect too much from Czechs at
                                        first, especially, we should have no illusions about their

                                        will come but it will have to be slow. Even now as <persName

                                        peace in Western Europe or from heating up of US–USSR
                                        relations but rather are directly related to developments in

                                        concessions were made to “Five.” No secret agreements were
                                        made and no secret documents involved. Soviets after Warsaw
                                        meeting needed way out of dead-end street and Czechs needed
                                        respite to continue along path of reform. Soviets are to be
                                        congratulated for way they worked things out; Czechs are to
                                        be congratulated because they have won right to continue
                                        along path of internal reform. They have also won

                                    <item>Soviet change of tactics at Cierna: I asked Pavicevic why
                                        Yugoslavs thought Soviets had suddenly appeared to change
                                        their tactics when at one point they seemed bent on military
                                        intervention. Pavicevic smilingly observed that perhaps I
                                        ought to ask Soviet Ambassador who was scheduled to call on
                                        him immediately after me, “but then I am afraid you would
                                        not get an answer.” He said he thought Soviets were
                                        [garble—finally?]convinced that to intervene directly would:
                                        (1) cause disruption of relative detente in Europe; (2)
                                        deprive them of support of major parties in international
                                        Communist movement all of whom vehemently opposed Soviet
                                        intervention; (3) have a disastrous effect on upcoming
                                        Moscow Conference of ComParties when already several
                                        parties, including Yugoslavia, had indicated they would not
                                        participate; (4) be a serious setback to Soviet prestige
                                        among the non-aligned countries; and (5) set back currently
                                        improving US-Soviet relations. Pavicevic observed that all
                                        key foreign <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss>'s (i.e., all

                                        that for first time in international Communist world USSR
                                        was “isolated“; its only support came from parties (e.g.
                                        West German, one of Greek splinters, etc.) with no power or
                                        influence. Nevertheless, Soviets made great contribution in
                                        finding way out of direct clash.</item>

                                        was very wise to avoid any action which could be used by

                        <p>4089. 1. My meeting with <persName corresp="#p_TJB1">Tito</persName> this
                            morning lasted one hour. During course of conversation he reviewed
                            Yugoslav position with respect to Czechoslovakia and repeated firm
                            support for objectives Dubcek government. He was frank in denouncing
                            Soviet armed intervention, describing it as complete surprise to <gloss
                                target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss>, and deplored Soviet disregard of basic
                            principles which should govern relations between states, saying Soviet
                            prestige throughout world had suffered a grievous setback. Yugoslavia,
                            he said, would continue to try to maintain normal relations with Warsaw
                            Pact group but he was emphatic in stating Yugoslavia would firmly adhere
                            to principles already publicly expressed. He asked my opinion of present
                            state of Yugoslav-American relations and seemed satisfied with my
                            answer. He did not pursue this point of suggesting material or moral
                            support though I have impression this may come later. He volunteered to
                            receive me at any time if my government should require any information
                            or clarification of Yugoslav position and implied hope that I would be
                            available if Yugoslav Govt had any suggestions to make. Full report of

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> received Yugoslav
                            Ambassador Crnobrnja for one hour on afternoon August 29. On August 27,
                            Ambassador Crnobrnja had requested an appointment following his return
                            from local leave. The conversation concerned Czechoslovakia and related
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Crnobrnja began by saying that Yugoslavia discredited the
                            theory of “revanchist plot” against Czechoslovakia. It seemed clear that
                            the Soviets wanted to stop the process of democratic and human
                            development in Czechoslovakia out of concern that a “chain reaction”
                            might affect other areas of the socialist world. Yugoslavia was
                            confident that Czechoslovakia had a socialist leadership. Yugoslavia
                            believes it inherent for the body of socialist society to proceed to
                            “more human goals” just as other human societies are doing. Yugoslavia
                            sensed no threat to socialism in Czechoslovakia. Yugoslavia would not,
                            however, exclude the existence of anti-socialist activity in
                            Czechoslovakia and believed that this activity may have had better
                            chance for expression in the more liberal Czechoslovakia of recent
                            months. However, liberalization had strengthened forces of socialism in
                            Czechoslovakia to a much greater degree.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the Moscow communiqué,<note n="2" xml:id="d192fn2">For text of
                                the communiqué and protocol issued in Moscow on August 27, see
                                Remington, Winter in Prague, pp. 376–382.</note> Ambassador
                            Crnobrnja did not know whether it should be called an “agreement“, but
                            Yugoslavia considers it as having been accepted by legally constituted
                            representatives of the Czech people. In a way, this orients Yugoslavia's
                            present position. Yugoslavia believes that the Czech leaders should be
                            allowed to assess what the Moscow agreement means in all its
                            consequences and aspects with a view to deciding on its future
                            treatment. The very fact that <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0538"
                            />the Moscow talks took place means a lot politically. Perhaps the
                            holding of talks was contrary to what the Soviets had anticipated.
                            Yugoslavia considers the exemplary conduct of the Czech people to have
                            been the greatest help in saving what was saved. All credit should go to
                            the Czech people and world public opinion.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Crnobrnja continued that Czechoslovak events were of great
                            significance not only for today but for tomorrow. They were tragic but
                            were lessons for many states including Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Crnobrnja saw one danger. If the Moscow agreement should lead
                            to a split in the Czech people, disaster would follow. Solidarity of the
                            Czech people remains the strongest ally for achieving Czech goals.
                            Neither the Czechs nor the Yugoslavs have a more powerful political
                            weapon than national solidarity. Unity in Yugoslavia is as good as in
                            the 1948–51 period. Unity is also good in Romania. These are great and
                            promising factors.</p>
                        <p>Yugoslavia is neither frightened nor worried. If the need should come,
                            the Yugoslav people know what they will do. They will defend their
                            independence. Under no condition will they stay quiet. On the contrary,
                            where relations with socialist states are concerned, the justification
                            for defense would be even greater. Crnobrnja asked the Secretary's
                            assessment regarding Czechoslovak events and their effect on East-West
                            relations, bridge building, and US–USSR discussions on vital
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we had felt well informed at all stages regarding the
                            deployment of Soviet and other forces in the area of Czechoslovakia as
                            well as the nature of the maneuvers under way. It was clear that the
                            maneuvers were intended to put pressure on Czechoslovakia. We did not
                            have advance information of the Soviet decision to move into
                            Czechoslovakia, but we did know that a move could be started at a
                            moment's notice. The decision to move must have been a very difficult
                            one for the Soviets. Internal Czech developments must have seemed a very
                            real threat to the Soviets for, as Ambassador Crnobrnja had said, they
                            might have “infected” the USSR itself.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary made it clear that there was no US–USSR understanding,
                            tacit or otherwise, regarding Czechoslovakia. He said he had told
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> several weeks
                            ago about our feelings concerning the independence of states and had
                            emphasized the reaction would be severe if the independence of
                            Czechoslovakia were threatened.<note n="3" xml:id="d192fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d70">Document 70</ref>.</note> The Secretary had
                            particularly protested what appeared to be a Soviet effort to create
                            pretext for intervention out of a myth of a Western plot against
                            Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                            the Warsaw Pact both knew that an attack by one against a country of the
                            other would lead to <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0539"/>war. <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, however, does not recognize the
                            right of Warsaw Pact countries to occupy the territory of a Warsaw Pact
                            member. This could not happen within <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. We gather that Moscow's black propaganda organs have
                            been trying to manufacture the myth of a US–USSR understanding on
                            Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0540"/>
                        <p>The Secretary stressed the outstanding conduct of the Czech people and
                            the extraordinary strength of world reaction in the face of the invasion
                            of Czechoslovakia. The US had not whipped up this reaction; it had been
                            immediate and spontaneous. The Soviets were probably surprised by the
                            strength of this reaction, all the more so because they tend to attach
                            more weight to propaganda than most countries do.</p>
                        <p>What happens in Czechoslovakia is of serious concern for the United
                            States. Not because we have had particularly good relations with the
                            Czechs, though. On the contrary, Prague over the years has been one of
                            the capitals most active in promoting “world revolution”. Czech arms
                            today are killing our men in Viet-Nam. Our concern relates to the
                            elementary point that, unless a small nation can live unmolested there
                            can be no peace in the world. Spheres of influence can never prove
                            satisfactory in achieving this condition, since the concept of spheres
                            of influence understands a “master race” within a sphere of influence.
                            We therefore subscribe to the principles set forth in the UN Charter
                            whereby every nation, large or small, has a right to its own national
                            existence.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that we were watching the situation as it related
                            to Romania and Yugoslavia. We have not seen the kind of build up of
                            forces which we clearly saw with regard to Czechoslovakia. However, if
                            Yugoslavia obtains information suggesting a build up and Yugoslavia
                            discreetly advises us of it, we will check the information as we have
                            the means to do so.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that we had noted considerable lack of enthusiasm
                            for the actions against Czechoslovakia within the countries which had
                            provided token units for invasion and occupation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that the
                            situation in Czechoslovakia had been achieved through a significant
                            deployment of Soviet troops to the south and west. Soviet troops were
                            now on the Bavarian border. We have an immediate interest in the length
                            of stay of these troops, because <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            must consider what this means with regard to the strength and deployment
                            of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces. Earlier this year at
                            Reykjavik the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ministers had
                            supported the possibility of a reduction of forces in central
                                Europe.<note n="4" xml:id="d192fn4">The <gloss target="#t_NAC1"

                            possibility was reversed by the Soviet move into Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stressed that we respected the way in which Yugoslavia had
                            expressed itself on the Czech events. We felt that the fact that some
                            socialist states had spoken out strongly had been a matter of great
                            importance in helping the Czechs to preserve something. If the USSR now
                            were to proceed against socialist states making this critical response,
                            a very grave situation could develop. Romania's geographic position and
                            Yugoslavia's, to an even greater degree, made this subject a matter of
                            great interest to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. A further
                            extension of Soviet forces would be a matter of very grave concern to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Pointing to a map of Europe,
                            the Secretary noted that, for instance, there were now no Soviet forces
                            in the Adriatic area.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the Czech events had had a serious effect on
                            US–USSR bilateral relations. Previously we had been in contact with
                            Moscow on very important matters. The Soviets must have known that their
                            action in Czechoslovakia would damage bilateral relations. Public
                            opinion and Congressional reaction were important factors and now were
                            negative toward the USSR. The great pity is that efforts at détente have
                            been blocked while at the same time problems have not evaporated. The
                            questions of missiles, Viet-Nam, and the Near East remain. We must think
                            more about what all this means. The Russians are presumably doing the
                            same.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary wondered what the move into Czechoslovakia signifies
                            regarding the USSR. Does it represent a step backward on other matters
                            as well? What were the dynamics of the situation leading to the decision
                            to move into Czechoslovakia? We don't know. The Soviets know how to
                            maintain silence better than we do. If one were to interpret this move
                            as irresponsible or impulsive or taken out of fear, it is distressing to
                            think of the decisions which might be taken by a capital having as much
                            destructive power at its disposal as Moscow. Does it mean that
                            irrational action is possible?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary added that the US has not been engaged in any way in any
                            shape or form of mischief in Czechoslovakia. There has been no <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> activity and no arms infiltration. The
                            Secretary said that, whereas his predecessor John Foster Dulles talked
                            about a rollback in central Europe, the present Administration has
                            wanted to improve relations with Eastern Europe and the USSR by bridge
                            building. The purpose has been to bring about broader serenity in the
                            world. We have not wanted bridge building to set one state against
                            another. It has been notable, however, that in recent months, the USSR
                            had been speaking negatively about bridge building. Within the USSR,
                            comment had been quite bitter on the subject. We have been especially
                            resentful about the theory of an “imperialist threat” which has been
                            pushed by the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>In concluding this portion of his remarks, the Secretary again invited
                            Ambassador Crnobrnja to have his government submit any <pb n="513"
                                xml:id="pg_513" facs="0541"/>information suggesting the development
                            of a threatening situation for Yugoslavia. The Secretary pointed out in
                            this connection that, with regard to Czechoslovakia, the Soviets
                            obviously felt their interests so fundamental that they were willing to
                            make major sacrifices regarding détente, US–USSR bilateral relations,
                            world popular opinion, and harmony within the family of communist
                            parties.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Crnobrnja thanked the Secretary for these views and turned to
                            the subject of US-Yugoslav bilateral relations. Ambassador Crnobrnja
                            said that Yugoslavia had no particular requests to make and did not want
                            to take advantage of the situation in this connection. Yugoslavia did
                            not want to irritate the USSR even though Yugoslav-Soviet relations had
                            already deteriorated and would probably deteriorate further. He said,
                            however, that it would be most unfortunate if developments were to lead
                            to paralysis in US-Yugoslav relations. He stressed that Yugoslavia
                            wanted to continue to proceed with the gradual development of relations
                            in areas of “real business”. In this connection, he said that Yugoslavia
                            soon would probably join Intelsat. Yugoslavia would do so because it saw
                            real business advantage in doing so. The US might attach other
                            importance to the matter. He said that Yugoslavia, as a small power,
                            wanted to avoid any action suggesting that it was within a sphere of
                            influence. It wanted to live freely and make its own decisions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded by answering that we did not believe that the
                            Czech situation would have a negative influence on US-Yugoslav
                            relations. We certainly did not want to create difficulties or
                            embarrassment for Yugoslavia. He agreed that the US and Yugoslavia
                            should proceed with matters in which they have a common interest. Public
                            opinion was favorable.</p>

                                    manufactured in Yugoslavia goes to USSR. Shipbuilding industry
                                    heavily reliant on Soviet orders. USSR owes Yugoslavia great

                            <item>Conversation with Yugoslav Ambassador Bogdan Crnobrnja on Monday,
                                September 23, 1968</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>When I went to the International Club to hear Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> on Czechoslovakia, I happened to
                            sit next to Ambassador Crnobrnja. The Ambassador invited me to join him
                            for supper after the speech.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Crnobrnja liked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1"
                                >Bohlen</persName>'s remarks—saying he was not surprised by them.
                            When he pressed me for amplification of our policy toward the Czech
                            crisis, I asked what he thought our policy should be. Ambassador
                            Crnobrnja said we should work for a broad settlement of outstanding
                            world issues, and move vigorously to prevent a return <pb n="516"
                                xml:id="pg_516" facs="0544"/>to the Cold War. We should seek a
                            Vietnam settlement—for which we need a bombing halt, move toward a
                            resolution of the Mid-East impasse, and advance on the disarmament
                            front. Crnobrnja said he realized some of these prescriptions would be
                            hard to take.</p>
                        <p>On Vietnam, I said I was pretty sure American policy would be decided on
                            its own merits and not linked to Czechoslovakia. Ambassador Crnobrnja
                            said he had heard rumors very recently of some sort of understanding
                            with the Soviets. I said that, so far as I knew, these were entirely
                            untrue. Earlier reports along these lines were categorically denied by
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Crnobrnja asked me what kind of role I thought the Soviets might play in
                            a Vietnam settlement. I said I didn't know; but I was personally
                            skeptical that the Soviets would force Hanoi's hand. I remarked that
                            Hanoi must even now be considering whether to negotiate this fall with
                            this Administration, or wait until next spring. How they would decide, I
                            didn't know. Ambassador Crnobrnja remarked that he thought the North
                            Vietnamese were seriously interested in a solution, but had a problem of
                            confidence. I said I did not know the details of the Paris negotiation,
                            but I was sure the other side knew how to make the seriousness of its
                            interest clear if it really wanted to move forward.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the Middle East, I said it sometimes looked as if we were
                            expected simply to force the Israelis back to the June 4 lines.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d194fn2">Reference is to the borders existing between
                                Israel and neighboring Arab states of United Arab Republic, Syria,
                                and Jordan before the “Six-Day War” (June 5–11, 1967).</note>
                            Crnobrnja said that might be the Arab point of view, but he would not
                            recommend it. He thought Nasser would also have to make real policy
                            changes. (Crnobrnja seemed cool to Nasser. This may have been a
                            reflection of Yugoslav annoyance at Nasser's reaction to the
                            Czechoslovak invasion.)</p>
                        <p>Crnobrnja said we should pursue a policy of détente. When I pressed him,
                            he seemed to be talking more about détente with Yugoslavia and the Third
                            World than an immediate return to easy relations with the invading
                            powers. He asked how worried I thought Yugoslavia should be, I said I
                            thought Yugoslavia's position was different from Czechoslovakia's. After
                            all, even Stalin had stopped short of military intervention. Yugoslavia
                            had been non-aligned for 20 years. During that time the U.S. had given
                            extensive economic and even military assistance. The Balkan Pact was
                            probably a complicating factor in Russian thinking. (Crnobrnja promptly
                            affirmed that it was still in effect.) Nevertheless, I realize a lot of
                            things have come unstuck in Eastern Europe.</p>
                        <p>Crnobrnja remarked on the signs of dissension and instability in the
                            Soviet Politburo, but did not offer any specifics. He said that an
                            indication of US support, interest and concern for Yugoslavia would be
                            very <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0545"/>helpful. In this
                            connection he mentioned the arrival in Washington this weekend of
                            Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Kiro
                                Gligorov</persName>. While the formal purpose of <persName
                                corresp="#p_GK1">Gligorov</persName>'s trip is to attend meetings of
                            the Bank and Fund, Crnobrnja made clear that the Yugoslav government was
                            taking advantage of the occasion to send over a high-level official. He
                            left the impression the Yugoslav government would appreciate a
                            high-level reception. In response to my question, Crnobrnja said he did
                            not have “any instructions” as to whether it was hoped <persName
                                corresp="#p_GK1">Gligorov</persName> could see Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> or the President. I said I could
                            not speak for the attitude of senior US personalities, but I know that
                            whatever appointments Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gligorov</persName>
                            requested would be most seriously considered. (The following day
                            Crnobrnja called me, saying he had just received a telegram that morning
                            indicating that <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gligorov</persName> would
                            like to meet Americans at the Cabinet level and also <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> if that were possible. I
                            asked the Ambassador if he were conveying his request to the State
                            Department, and he said yes, of course.) Crnobrnja gave no indication
                                <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gligorov</persName> was likely to request
                            military assistance. What he talked about was general support and
                            economic relations.</p>
                        <p>Crnobrnja said there were a few matters which he was reluctant to
                            mention—but US action would be very helpful. He said a Soviet request
                            for four sonars was pending, and the Yugoslav government would be most
                            appreciative if a way could be found to furnish them. The Mother and
                            Child hospital has also been long pending. Crnobrnja said it would be
                            very helpful if the US government could be more liberal in the use of
                            dinars. (Crnobrnja did not elaborate on what he had in mind.) Lastly,
                            the Ambassador said the Yugoslav government was pleased and gratified at
                            the attitude shown by the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and the
                            Export-Import Bank. He hoped the US government would continue to keep a
                            benign eye on this area of economic collaboration.</p>
                        <p>Crnobrnja was agitated at the activities of Serb and Croat emigres. He
                            said we had succeeded in damping down emigre denunciations of the
                            Yugoslav government for a period of time after the bombing of the
                            Embassy and Consulates. This showed we could do something if we really
                            tried. I questioned whether we could do very much, and suggested that it
                            may have been the emigres themselves who had pulled in their horns.</p>
                        <p>Crnobrnja said many Yugoslavs—including his predecessor—had been
                            disturbed over what they regarded as an American tendency to doubt that
                            Yugoslavia was really independent and non-aligned. The Czech crisis had
                            proved Yugoslav independence of action once again. I said the American
                            government had never doubted this. The only time I could remember when
                            there was concern about the balance and stability of Yugoslav policy was
                            during a period of a month or two after the Mid-East war. We had the
                            impression the Yugoslavs may have over-reacted to <pb n="518"
                                xml:id="pg_518" facs="0546"/>developments in Greece and elsewhere at
                            the time. Crnobrnja promptly filled in the missing details, including
                            fear of the Italian military dispositions, etc. He said he realized that
                            there had been an over-reaction.</p>
                        <p>Crnobrnja mentioned the slow decline of US economic assistance. I said
                            this was not a reflection of a change in US attitude. Partly it was a
                            reflection of increasing Yugoslav economic success and
                            self-reliance.</p>
                        <p>Crnobrnja observed that—even with its non-aligned posture—Yugoslavia was
                            of some help to the West. For example, Italy must feel more secure with
                            no Soviet naval base in the Bay of Kotor. Crnobrnja remarked somewhat
                            gloomily that the Soviets were a great deal less understanding than the
                            Americans. It was hard to be a small country.</p>

                        <p>Deputy Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gligorov</persName>
                            conveyed Marshal Tito's greetings, and said he wanted to assure the
                            President of Yugoslavia's resoluteness in this time and her desire for
                            friendly relations with the United States.</p>
                        <p>The President said we also want to build better relations. We are
                            distressed at recent events in Eastern Europe. We did all we could
                            before the invasion of Czechoslovakia—which was a tragic act, against a
                            country which only wanted to exercise its independence.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had spoken out firmly about the situation in
                            Eastern Europe. We had not sought any sort of alliance or pact with any
                            Eastern European country, and the Soviets did not have reason to believe
                                <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0547"/>their security threatened.
                            Students of history have noted that when aggressors taste blood, the
                            appetite grows. The recent situation had not been totally unlike a
                            quarter century ago. We are concerned, and determined that aggression
                            not spread.</p>
                        <p>The President continued that we are more concerned, perhaps, than some of
                            our colleagues and friends. We know the consequences if aggression
                            should win out. We were ready to talk on vital subjects with the Soviet
                            Union just before the Czechoslovak invasion. We had vigorously pursued
                            missile talks, agreed on the time and place, and were ready. The Soviet
                            government fully realized the effect of its invasion.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> was
                            also important to the Russians—as well as the missile talks. So was a
                            solution in the Middle East and Vietnam. Rather than move on these
                            questions, however, the Soviets preferred to take the course they did,
                            and to pursue the interest they regarded as more important.</p>
                        <p>We shall have to wait and see, the President said. The Deputy Prime
                            Minister should take <persName corresp="#p_TJB1">Tito</persName> his
                            regards. One of his regrets on leaving office was the fact that he had
                            not had the opportunity to visit with Marshal Tito. The President knows
                            the resolution of the Yugoslav people. They have gone through periods of
                            the greatest difficulty, and they know the price they will have to pay
                            to defend those things most important. The easy way has tragic
                            consequences.</p>
                        <p>The President said he certainly does not want to see more killing in the
                            world. He had two boys in combat in Vietnam. But he appreciates how the
                            appetite grows with success. The President asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_GK1">Gligorov</persName> if he had any views.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gligorov</persName> said he believed the
                            President's assessment was correct. Every nation and society must be
                            determined to defend its independence. The Yugoslavs liberated
                            themselves in World War II and know what the price is. Yugoslavia's
                            President, its government and its nation are resolute, and we need have
                            no doubts on that score. Yugoslavia spoke out immediately to condemn the
                            aggression against Czechoslovakia. This is why Yugoslavia is the object
                            of a campaign of vilification from the Soviet side.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gligorov</persName> said Yugoslavia is ready
                            for any eventuality. Nevertheless, the last thing they wish for is a
                            rupture of Soviet-American contacts—which are good. It is only through
                            dialogue that the greatest powers can seek agreement and find solutions
                            to the hardest questions. The two greatest powers have very great
                            responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>This is one thing. Another, however, is the importance of not suffocating
                            the freedom of small nations. The Yugoslavs remember America's role in
                            1948. They greatly appreciate all we have done. We helped them defend
                            their independence and helped them continue their economic
                            development.</p>
                        <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0548"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gligorov</persName> said he realized
                            Yugoslavia and America do not agree on all subjects. Nevertheless, our
                            cooperation and friendship have increased, even if the forms have
                            changed. The President will find Yugoslavia has a policy of peace and
                            cooperation. For that purpose Yugoslavia will pay any price.</p>
                        <p>Often, <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gligorov</persName> said, the Yugoslavs
                            haven't been well understood. But there is no other way. The Yugoslavs
                            believe they have a friend in the U.S. That was why Yugoslavia's
                            government and President considered it useful to take advantage of
                                <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gligorov</persName>'s presence in the
                            U.S. to express these feelings. <persName corresp="#p_GK1"
                                >Gligorov</persName> said he realized he was not saying anything
                            new.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gligorov</persName> said the Yugoslavs had
                            chosen their own way in development and toward democracy. They are
                            stimulating the initiative of their people. They are developing an
                            economy open to the world. They are members of the Bank and Fund. They
                            want private capital. This year Yugoslavia had ten million foreign
                            tourists, 95% from the West. It is doubtful that there is any more open
                            frontier in Europe than Yugoslavia's with Italy and Austria. Yugoslavia
                            wants its own society and way of life. It is building and defending an
                            open society.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gligorov</persName> said Yugoslavia is trying
                            to build bridges to the “other world” in the West. This is along the
                            lines of America's policy toward the East. Marshal
                                <persName>Tito</persName> greatly appreciates the personal policy of
                            the President.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gligorov</persName> said Marshal
                                <persName>Tito</persName> appreciates the President's efforts to
                            find an acceptable solution in Vietnam, and reach a reasonable
                            settlement in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>Marshal Tito, according to <persName corresp="#p_GK1"
                            >Gligorov</persName>, considers Yugoslavia happy that she is not in the
                            same position as in 1948, when she had to ask for grants of American
                            aid. In the meantime, Yugoslavia has developed—and American aid helped
                            greatly in this process.</p>
                        <p>Now, said <persName corresp="#p_GK1">Gligorov</persName>, Yugoslavia can
                            talk on the basis of partnership. Yugoslavia wants to develop its
                            commerce. It wants U.S. capital, and welcomes joint ventures. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GK1">Gligorov</persName> said he had put forward certain
                            specific proposals during this visit, but would not bother the President
                            with them. However, these proposals reflect Yugoslavia's desire to make
                            her own contribution, and for future arrangements to correspond to the
                            interests of both countries. American support would represent support
                            for the independence of Yugoslavia and for Yugoslavia's independent
                            position.</p>
                        <p>The President said he could not anticipate events in Eastern Europe, and
                            would not try to answer all <persName corresp="#p_GK1"
                                >Gligorov</persName>'s points. We are watching the situation with
                            the greatest care. The President said he was grateful for what <persName
                                corresp="#p_GK1">Gligorov</persName> had to say, and for his visit.
                            The President, in closing the conversation, said he would be happy to
                            have any ideas Marshal <persName>Tito</persName> would like to give him
                            on the Eastern European situation.</p>

                                “catastrophe“; that he had been worried Soviets would move against
                                Czechs until Cierna meeting, but that after that he decided Soviets
                                had given up any ideas of use of force; ensuing invasion which
                                occurred within fortnight of Bratislava meeting had shocked him. He
                                spoke indignantly of “absurdity” of Soviet attempts to justify
                                invasion, saying that charges that counter-revolution was taking
                                place were completely unfounded.</item>

                                    1968, Gunnar Jarring, U.N. Special Representative in the Middle
                                    East, met with Arab and Israeli officials in Nicosia. After his
                                    return to New York, he continued secret discussions relating to

                                does. He took usual <gloss target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss> line on the
                                ME, saying Israelis have not accepted UN resolution and that a

                                accepted resolution, and that an imposed solution simply would not
                                work. At conclusion of this portion of conversation, <persName

                                may be vital to solution of ME problem. He expressed concern about
                                what he interpreted to be signs of renewal hostilities, and said it
                                is most important for Mediterranean area, the Balkans in particular,
                                that problem be solved speedily. At this point he digressed
                                somewhat, and said that no one wanted Balkans to again become a

                                opportunity for me to exchange views with leading Yugoslav
                                officials, including prominent members of legislative and executive
                                branches of government. All have stressed long-term rather than
                                immediate aspect of threat. They seem to recognize that situation
                                does not call for classical variety of aid program and have asked
                                for no commitments. They have shown special concern over Soviet
                                plans for Balkan and Mediterranean areas, particularly with regard
                                to foothold Soviets are gaining in Eastern Mediterranean. As
                                emphasized by Acting Secretary Pavicevic in talks this morning
                                Yugoslavs welcome any action on our part which would have a
                                deterrent effect on Soviet aggression in this area of world. In this
                                connection it seems pretty clear that Yugoslavs evaluate positively
                                signals we have given Moscow this week beginning with statement made
                                by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> after

                                        Soviet standpoint) of leading role of Party in internal life
                                        of country and centralized planning. Yugoslavs viewed Soviet
                                        statement on changes contemplated as step backward,
                                        especially since spring before there had been serious talk
                                        about necessity for reform. In past <gloss target="#t_GOY1"
                                            >GOY</gloss> had developed good relations with USSR
                                        confident that USSR was sincere in its professions
                                        [garble—friendship for] Yugoslavia and that it was
                                        unthinkable that USSR would attack another friendly
                                        socialist state. As result of this confidence <gloss

                                        Main issues between Moscow and Belgrade have always been
                                        role of party in internal life and economic reform and these
                                        have been permanent sources of disagreement. Soviets have
                                        always disliked economic reform and role <gloss

                                        Yugoslavia last month let Soviets know that if they had any

                                        Yugoslavia is in dark re Soviet long-range intentions. They
                                        believe Soviets may well have aggressive intentions towards
                                        Balkans for both strategic and political reasons. Strategic
                                        reasons are same as they were at time of Tsars: Moscow seeks
                                        warm-water port and wishes to control land approaches to ME.
                                        Yugoslavs believe Soviets are only ones who gained powerwise
                                        in Arab-Israeli war of last year. Soviets have told
                                        Yugoslavs they in Mediterranean now and there has been no
                                        reaction from West. Political reasons stem from Soviet
                                        concern over implications of internal political, economic,
                                        and social system in Yugoslavia.</item>

                                            >GOY</gloss> believes that in event of Soviet aggression
                                        against Yugoslavia West cannot afford to remain indifferent.
                                            <gloss target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss> does not wish to say
                                        that support for Yugoslavia is 'vital' for that is a
                                        'relative' term; it does believe, however, that it is most
                                        important for Western strategic interests. It is important
                                        that Moscow knows that West is not indifferent to what
                                        happens in Balkans. First deterrent is Moscow's recognition
                                        that Yugoslavs will fight, which poses dilemma.<gloss

                                        as many dilemmas to think about as possible. Second
                                        deterrent would be evidence of Western interest in
                                        preserving <gloss target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss>'s
                                        independence and integrity. Two most important qualities of
                                        Yugoslavia's independence are its nonaligned policy and its
                                        internal system of government. Would be helpful if West
                                        could make very clear its interest in preservation of
                                        Yugoslavia as independent and nonaligned country. Besides
                                        public statements there are various ways, various channels
                                        that can be used. <gloss target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss>

                                        have been expensive. Military expenses in past have been

                            sees recent developments in Eastern Europe. Development of U.S.
                            relations with the Soviets, he said, are somewhat impeded by the Vietnam
                            war. The U.S. would like to continue normal exchanges with the Soviets
                            but we are meeting with a difficult attitude. This attitude is reflected
                            only in part in Eastern Europe and differs from country to country. The
                            U.S. would like to relax tensions and improve trade relations with
                            Eastern Europe.</p>

                        <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KJ2">Klaus</persName> stated that this
                            is a most important subject for Austria. Austria conducts an active
                            Eastern European policy, particularly since the normalization of its
                            relations with Eastern Europe.</p>
                        <p>Seen from Austria, the Chancellor continued, those countries of Eastern
                            Europe, which in 1945 turned completely toward the East, are now turning
                            back toward Western Europe as toward an old family. The governments are
                            permitting more liberalization but, he noted, the government leaders are
                            in no way turning from Communism. However, a healthy climate is being
                            created and Austria wishes to take advantage of it. Austrians find that
                            old traditional relations with the former members of the Hapsburg Empire
                            permit them a special entree. Austrian administration in these lands is
                            well remembered, and this makes discussions for the Austrians
                            easier.</p>
                        <p>Human contacts between Austrians and other Eastern Europeans are
                            increasing, the Chancellor said. 100,000 Austrians have friends or
                            families in Eastern Europe. Crossing the borders is made easier and real
                            human contacts can be made. Austrians now go to Yugoslavia on vacation
                            and many thousands of Austrians go to Hungary and many Hungarians now
                            visit Austria. The Chancellor said that on summer evenings in some parts
                            of Vienna one can hear more Eastern European languages being spoken than
                            German. The Chancellor noted that cultural exchanges in things German
                            are easier through Austria for the Eastern Europeans than directly with
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said that economic relations with Eastern Europe are
                            making progress. Austrian-Rumanian trade has quadrupled in recent years.
                            The Austrian Government realizes that this does not necessarily improve
                            relations; politics for the communist countries comes before trade and
                            Austria cannot become dependent on Eastern European trade.</p>
                        <p>Austria actively cultivates official exchanges with Eastern Europe, the
                            Chancellor said. He said he had invited this year to Austria the prime
                            ministers of Poland and Rumania and he himself had had an interesting
                            visit to Yugoslavia. For the time being, he is not accepting invitations
                            to the other Eastern European countries since he wants the officials of
                            those lands to come to Austria first.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1"
                                >Leddy</persName> about Czechoslovakia, the Chancellor said that
                            relations here are difficult. Austria first normalized its relations
                            with Yugoslavia, reached an agreement on Carinthia, then the Government
                            reached property agreements with Rumania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and
                            Hungary. However, no property agreement has been reached with
                            Czechoslovakia. He explained that since the days of the Hapsburg
                            monarchy, Austria-Czechoslovakian property has been closely intertwined
                            and that large sums of money are involved. This, he said, makes reaching
                            an agreement difficult.</p>
                        <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0556"/>
                        <p>As regards Poland, the Chancellor said Austria has no difficulties. A
                            large Austrian cultural institute has been established in Poland and
                            cultural exchanges are going on, as well as increased trade.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lisle asked for the Chancellor's assessment of the status of the
                            Catholic Church in Eastern Europe and relations with the Vatican.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said that status of the Catholic Church differs from
                            country to country. In Poland improvement of relations with the Vatican
                            has come the farthest. Relations with Yugoslavia are somewhat tense but
                            an agreement is being negotiated. The Chancellor said he had visited the
                            Archbishop in Belgrade but had not seen the Cardinal in Zagreb. Vatican
                            relations with Czechoslovakia are normalizing and in Hungary Cardinal
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJ1">Mindszenty</persName> is the only
                            remaining problem. Rumania, the government which has in many respects
                            gone further in normalizing other things, has been the most difficult
                            for the Catholic Church. Four bishops have died in prison and one is now
                            under house arrest. The Chancellor said that Austrian Cardinal Koenig
                            has attempted to establish relations with the Catholic hierarchy in each
                            of the Eastern European countries. He has had good relations with them
                            at the Ecumenical Council.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lisle asked about the newspaper reports that Rumania wants to act as
                            a mediator in Vietnam. Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KJ2"
                                >Klaus</persName> said that in the four hours of his discussions
                            with <persName corresp="#p_MI1">Maurer</persName> the question of
                            mediation was not mentioned. He said apparently <persName
                                corresp="#p_MI1">Maurer</persName> mentioned this only while
                            traveling in Western Austria. There is no question, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ2">Klaus</persName> said, of either Austria or Rumania
                            acting as mediator. <persName corresp="#p_MI1">Maurer</persName> did
                            criticize U.S.-Vietnam policy. The Chancellor said that Austria has
                            stated that it is interested in securing peace but he noted that Foreign
                            Minister Kreisky had said that no solution to Vietnam is possible
                            without U.S. prestige being protected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Karasek said that so as not to create a false impression he wished to
                            emphasize that the Austrian Government had not discussed mediation in
                            Vietnam with the Rumanians. He has tried to check the source of these
                            reports of <persName corresp="#p_MI1">Maurer</persName>'s alleged
                            statements. The reports seemed to have been the conclusions of a
                            reporter who had heard several of <persName corresp="#p_MI1"
                                >Maurer</persName>'s statements on Vietnam. Other reporters who had
                            heard Maurer on the same occasions had not confirmed this
                            conclusion.</p>
                        <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KJ2">Klaus</persName> said that there
                            can be no mediation unless both sides request it. He added that visitors
                            to the West from the East have repeatedly tried to get the Austrian
                            Government to denounce U.S.-Vietnam policies and the Austrians have at
                            all times rejected this.</p>

                            <item>Vietnam. Secretary made it crystal clear that US will not permit
                                North Vietnam take South Vietnam by force. To do otherwise would
                                destroy credibility of US which of fundamental importance to peace
                                and war in world, as Berlin and Cuban missile crises have proved in
                                past. Toncic replied it was good to hear US would not sell out South
                                Vietnam. In his view no political solution possible without first
                                denying other side military victory. In this sense he considered
                                “American victory” now secure. When Toncic asked why US did not
                                destroy Haiphong, Secretary replied that all important military
                                targets except those in heavily populated areas have been covered.
                                (Comment: Toncic's privately expressed views contrasted rather

                                it would be big mistake for world endorse ChiCom militancy just at

                            <item>Albania. Toncic reported Albanians in Vienna have for some time
                                been making vague proposals for coming nearer to West. He asked how
                                Austria should respond. Secretary speculated it possible Albanians
                                are becoming restive under ChiCom monopoly and stated it would be
                                constructive and helpful if Austrians could probe their intentions,
                                though it would clearly be mistake for US do so. <persName

                                Austrians should keep one thing in mind: No vital issues such as
                                Germany are to be settled without US. Secretary added that US did

                            <item>Common Market-Kennedy Round. Toncic spoke at some length about
                                Austrian desire there [share?] in economic advantages of Common
                                Market without paying political price. “Everything would be easy for
                                us if Common Market were to conclude trade agreement with Austria.”
                                Secretary expressed understanding for problem, but when Toncic
                                suggested maybe <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> would help
                                relieve problem and give Austria a waiver in five years, Secretary
                                explained at length importance of achieving progress in Kennedy
                                Round by early March if protectionist course by US is to be

                            <item>Austrian draftees in US. Toncic asked for some kind of assurance
                                that Austrians in US on immigrant visas not be drafted. Secretary
                                stated that as general principle permanent residents who participate

                                Secretary admitted there was special problem with Austria because
                                legislation conflicted with earlier treaties. Secretary pointed out
                                selective service had worked out problem by administrative means.
                                Secretary suggested Austria and US not engage this question as a
                                matter of principle. Secretary pointed out to Toncic that if
                                question gets stirred up in Austria through public pronouncements,
                                it will also get stirred up in US Congress. Secretary suggested
                                Toncic answer inquiries from Austrian press along fol lines:
                                Authorities in US have complicated problem because of conflict
                                between treaties and subsequent Congressional legislation. As a
                                pragmatic matter we have been able work out cases that seem of
                                special interest. We hope that can continue.</item>

                                    >GA</gloss> address Toncic spoke in moderate tones about this
                                problem, stating that goal of current negotiations had been to
                                establish effective and internationally guaranteed autonomy for
                                minority. Toncic resolutely condemned use of violence to resolve
                                this problem.) Secretary recalled that in past Austria had tried <pb

                                and expressed hope we would be spared recurrence of such

                            <item>SWA. Toncic expressed his unhappiness over way SWA problem was
                                being handled in UN. Secretary stated we too have serious
                                reservations about African res on SWA, but expressed hope that
                                further discussions would lead to some changes. When <persName

                                reassess common threat, establish new force goals to meet threat and
                                allocate individual responsibilities. Toncic's only reaction was
                                that it would be dangerous if US strength in Europe were to be
                                replaced by German strength.</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GK2">Gruber</persName> said that it is not a love
                            affair but economic necessity which leads Austria to seek arrangements
                            with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. Austrian industry must
                            specialize in, for example, machine tools and needs export markets.
                            Austria is beginning to feel the effects of <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> trade barriers in its industry and agriculture. If
                            economic troubles come, <persName corresp="#p_GK2">Gruber</persName>
                            observed, political troubles will follow.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GK2">Gruber</persName> continued that Austrian
                            neutrality forbids membership in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            but Austria is seeking an affiliation. The Soviets do not like an
                            Austrian connection with the Common Market in any form. However,
                            following the <persName corresp="#p_KJ2">Klaus</persName> visit to
                                Moscow,<note n="2" xml:id="d200fn2">Chancellor <persName

                                20–21.</note> the Austrians feel that the Soviets now understand
                            Austria's economic needs better. The Austrians have supplied the Soviets
                            with a long paper on the justification for Austrian association,
                            including a factory-by-factory analysis. But the Soviets suggest
                            separate trade agreements with the countries of the Common Market.
                            Gruber expressed his personal opinion that the Soviets themselves
                            realize that they one day must recognize the Common Market. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GK2">Gruber</persName> said he feels that the Soviets
                            will do nothing dramatic as regards Austria's association with the
                            Common Market.</p>
                        <p>As regards <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>, the Austrians have felt
                            from the beginning that <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> was an
                            instrument of negotiation with the Common Market. The Austrians see no
                            problem in this connection. The French position is important to Austria,
                            he continued. As a member of the Common Market and a signer of the State
                                Treaty,<note n="3" xml:id="d200fn3">For text of the Austrian State
                                Treaty, signed in Vienna on May 15, 1955, see 6 UST 2369.</note>
                            their attitude is significant, and France has been helpful in Austria's
                            dealings with the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> asked if it is not a
                            fact that Austria's trade with the Common Market has increased.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GK2">Gruber</persName> replied that this was
                            so as long as the general European economic boom was on. But with the
                            present economic setbacks, Austria feels the effects of Common Market
                            tariffs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> asked if the
                            success of the Kennedy Round negotiations followed by trade agreements
                            with the Common Market would take care of Austria's trade difficulties.
                            Gruber said he hoped so, but that trade agreements were not enough.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> asked about the Soviet
                            position. Are the Soviets completely opposed to any arrangement with the
                            Common Market, including a trade agreement? <persName corresp="#p_GK2"
                                >Gruber</persName> replied that the answer really will be found in
                            giving Austria's affiliation the proper title, which will not be
                            objectionable to the Soviets. The Soviets will never give their official
                            blessing.</p>

                                >Gruber</persName> said that approximately 50 percent of Austria's
                            trade is with the Common Market, 15 percent with the East and 17 percent
                            with <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> asked <persName

                            of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> entry into the Common Market. Will

                            this? <persName corresp="#p_GK2">Gruber</persName> replied that when the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> decides to enter they will get
                            sufficient support. But, he said, he foresees long negotiations with the

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GK2">Gruber</persName> asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> for the US attitude toward
                            countries making arrangements with the Common Market. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> replied that the US does not like
                            preferential arrangements now being negotiated with a number of
                            countries. If such negotiations would lead to full membership, the US,
                            he said, would not object. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1"
                                >Leddy</persName> added that the US recognizes that Austria is a
                            special case, being inhibited by the State Treaty from full membership.
                            But, he added, the US does not like the piecemeal moves being made by
                            other countries for special and preferential deals with the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, if these lead to discrimination
                            against US trade.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said that
                            we hope that it will be clear that an Austrian arrangement is a special
                            case and will not be a precedent. <persName corresp="#p_GK2"
                                >Gruber</persName> replied that he is sure this will be clear.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Stabler asked about the requirements for approval in the Austrian
                            Parliament of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> arrangement. Is a
                            two-thirds vote required, he asked?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GK2">Gruber</persName> replied that the wording of
                            the text of the agreement will determine if a two-thirds vote is
                            necessary. He added that the Austrian Government will want Socialist
                            Party support anyway. <persName corresp="#p_GK2">Gruber</persName> said
                            he has the feeling that the trade unions now support an arrangement.</p>

                        <p>The President thanked the Chancellor for expressing the gratitude of the
                            Austrian people for the aid given by the United States to Austria. All
                            Americans hold names like Vienna and Salzburg in high esteem and they
                            have a high regard for the Austrian people. This would be demonstrated
                            at the White House dinner as people from all corners of the United
                            States come to honor the Chancellor and the Austrian people. It is very
                            much regretted that we have the turbulence in our city at this time and
                            the inconvenience of the curfew, which might make it impossible for some
                            people to attend.<note n="2" xml:id="d201fn2">Rioting broke out in
                                Washington following the April 4 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther
                                King, Jr. Federal troops were brought in to quell the violence and a
                                curfew was established on April 5.</note> However, the greater
                            majority of them will be there and they are looking forward to it.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the United States is also trying to build some
                            bridges to the Eastern European countries, following the splendid
                            example set by Austria. We are exploring the possibility of expanding
                            trade between the United States and the Eastern European countries.</p>
                        <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KJ2">Klaus</persName> replied that as a
                            country bordering directly on the Eastern bloc, and as a free and
                            democratic country, Austria has been observing a steady process of
                            loosening in the monolithic bloc led by the Soviet Union and a
                            considerable interest by the Eastern countries in the rest of Europe.
                            Since 1955–56 a certain turning around and looking more towards the
                            Western world again can be closely observed among those nations. Austria
                            is trying to gear its policy to this development.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> assured the
                            Chancellor that the United States is very appreciative of Austria's
                            efforts in this direction. We are trying very much to do the same, as we
                            know that this is a turbulent area which seeks to find a new level of
                            balance while looking for more freedom.</p>
                        <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0563"/>
                        <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KJ2">Klaus</persName> said he wished to
                            make very clear that in those areas, 70 to 90 percent of the people are
                            not thinking along Communist lines, but their thoughts are very much the
                            same as in the West. Four years ago he talked to a Hungarian engineer
                            who had been imprisoned by <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Kadar</persName>
                            and asked him if he would consider it strange or natural if the
                            Chancellor were to shake the hand of the man who imprisoned him. The
                            engineer's response was typical. He said please do come and visit him by
                            all means. We must not forget that 80 percent of the Hungarians think
                            and feel with the people of the West and want a democratic way of
                            life.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor recalled that he had made visits to Moscow, Budapest,
                            Bucharest, Belgrade and Sofia in 1967 and also traveled East as a
                            private citizen. Everywhere he found great sympathy for Austria, for
                            Europe, for the free world and for democracy. Austria, being
                            historically and geographically the closest country to the Eastern bloc,
                            can demonstrate to these countries a different way of life and
                            government.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> replied that we
                            have observed Austria's policy with great interest and we very much
                            appreciate her excellent efforts. We want to contribute wherever we can
                            to such a policy. He hoped that the Chancellor would be able to discuss
                            details of this policy more closely with Secretary <persName

                        <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KJ2">Klaus</persName> said that this
                            conversation had been a great experience for him. He was grateful to
                            have had the opportunity to meet with the President personally and to
                            discuss the three most important issues of concern to the United States.
                            He thanked the President for having spoken with him so frankly and in
                            such a cordial manner and took this as a token of the trust that exists
                            between the two countries. He hoped that his future meetings with the
                            President and with his very able Secretary of State would contribute to
                            a continued exchange of views between our two governments and that those
                            talks would be fruitful. He thanked the President for having given him
                            this opportunity on a very, very busy day.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> closed by saying
                            that he was very happy that the Chancellor could come and see him and he
                            was looking forward to being with him again at the White House
                            dinner.</p>

                                statements re Czech invasion had been without polemics (he is still

                                more strongly), he inquired how we presently viewed threat to

                                    analysis of the Czech situation. (Ibid.)</note> I told him that
                                while Soviets obviously had formidable capability to move on
                                Romania, information available does not lead us to believe
                                intervention is in prospect for time being. Re Yugoslavia, I
                                indicated I knew of no intelligence indicating there is any
                                extraordinary Warsaw Pact build-up on Yugoslav frontiers.
                                Furthermore, some qualified observers in Europe and elsewhere
                                doubted that present Soviet leadership would undertake what Stalin
                                had decided was not a profitable venture some twenty years
                                ago.</item>

                                doubted Soviets planned any imminent military move against Romania,
                                Yugoslavia or elsewhere at this time, one could never be certain.
                                Therefore, on most confidential and informal basis, he would like to
                                know how we would react if in fact Soviets moved in Europe against
                                such targets as Romania, Yugoslavia, West Berlin and particularly
                                Austria. (Comment: <persName corresp="#p_KJ2">Klaus</persName>

                                targets he mentioned represented a different situation. Romania,
                                like Czechoslovakia, was a member of the Warsaw Pact and <gloss

                                state, had been independent of Moscow since 1948. Furthermore, it
                                seemed certain that if Soviets moved on Yugoslavia, the Yugoslavs
                                would resist bitterly as they had the German invasion in the last

                                Austria, on the other hand, was a militarily neutral country and not
                                a member of any Western security pact. However, we, as well as
                                Britain, France and Soviet Union, were signatories of the Austrian
                                State Treaty which recognized Austria's independence and territorial
                                integrity. If Soviets invaded free and independent Austria, a very
                                grave situation would obviously arise which would affect the
                                military balance of power and equilibrium in Europe. Exactly how the

                                countries would react to such an aggression I could not say.
                                However, in this connection I assumed that as chief of government of
                                a neutral state he was not seeking any specific guarantee or

                                query was informal, that he would make no record of our
                                conversation, that I was right in assuming he wanted to know our
                                “political reaction rather than military reaction,” and that he
                                hoped our conversation would be held in strictest confidence. He
                                said, however, that he would be grateful if we could give him some
                                private indication that there would be a “serious political reaction
                                in the United States if Austria were attacked.” I replied I would
                                hold the substance of our discussion in strictest confidence and
                                would report it most confidentially to Dept. I personally felt that
                                we would take a very grave view of any Soviet attack against Austria
                                since, as contrasted with the cases of Hungary and Czechoslovakia,
                                it would be an attack against a free and independent nation that was
                                really a basic part of Western Europe even though it was militarily
                                neutral.</item>

                                about possibility of Soviet move against Romania, Yugoslavia and
                                even Austria, he did not share view that Austria was threatened.
                                While Soviets would unquestionably move against any member of Warsaw
                                Pact that Soviets thought might try to detach itself from Moscow's
                                orbit, Soviets recognize that Austria is free and independent state
                                which, while militarily neutral, is integral part of democratic
                                West. If Soviets moved against Austria, it would, in his judgment,
                                only be if they were prepared for major war with Western powers,
                                which he strongly doubted. He said in strict confidence that
                                Austrian military had bad case of jitters and has been the source of
                                reports that major move against other Eastern and Central European

                                basis of these reports were rumors of sketchiest kind picked up by

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_WK1">Waldheim</persName> emphasized that,
                            contrary to the impression created by Austrian newspapers, there had not
                            been a sense of panic among the Austrians and there had never been a
                            fear of Soviet invasion, although there had been and still remains
                            serious concern. He admitted that the Austrian military establishment
                            had contributed to the sense of nervousness by its prediction of Soviet
                            action against Austria. This fear had been based upon the large numbers
                            of Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia,<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">Soviet
                                troops held maneuvers in Czechoslovakia June 19–30.</note> illegal
                            over-flights over Austrian territory and a three-day period when Soviet
                            leaders were not available to the Austrian Ambassador in Moscow. The
                            current feeling is that the Soviets will not undertake direct action
                            against Austria because to do so would bring on a direct confrontation
                            with the West. It is difficult to see into the future but Austria
                            expects no action by Warsaw Pact powers against Yugoslavia or
                            Austria.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that in August we had considered the chances of an
                            intervention in Czechoslovakia to be 51/49. We had the impression from
                            the Soviet Ambassador and others that developments in Prague represented
                            a fundamental threat to the Soviet Union and that possible Czech
                            defection from the Communist Bloc had been raised. In addition, the
                            Czechs themselves had raised questions regarding the fundamental
                            governing position of the Communist Party.</p>
                        <p>The question which now remains is the presence of Soviet forces near the
                            Bavarian border. This is a problem for <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> and certain steps will be taken—these steps are a
                            matter of prudence rather than steps arising from a fear of immediate
                            attack.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary outlined possible actions which might be taken by Warsaw
                            Pact powers in a descending order of gravity.</p>

                                surely involve a confrontation with the West. The U.S., France and
                                Great Britain have an interest in Austrian independence arising from
                                the State Treaty and if Austria were to call on the signatories of
                                the Treaty to help her preserve her independence, this would surely
                                precipitate a crisis.</item>

                            <item>Soviet action against Yugoslavia would produce a far more

                                Soviet actions aimed at the Adriatic area. The question arises
                                whether Yugoslavia is still considered a member of the Socialist
                                commonwealth. In this regard, the Secretary mentioned a press
                                briefing recently at the Soviet Embassy which indicated that the
                                Soviets do not consider Yugoslavia to be a member of the Socialist
                                Bloc.</item>

                                The question regarding possible intervention in Romania was put
                                directly to Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                    >Dobrynin</persName> who replied categorically that the Soviet
                                Union is not planning action against that country.<note n="3"
                                    xml:id="d204fn3">See <ref target="#d167">Document

                                given to that response, we do not see the threat of military action
                                against Romania nor any of the other three areas at the present

                        <p>This can obviously change very quickly. We are concerned about the recent
                                <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> article which apparently set forth a
                            new doctrine of the “Socialist commonwealth.”<note n="4"

                            persons in the Soviet Union and elsewhere who require such an
                            explanation. On the other hand, the Soviets may have indeed evolved this
                            new theory which may be used to explain further military moves.</p>
                        <p>In summary, we doubt the likelihood of further military moves at the
                            present, although the situation remains one of utmost gravity. An attack
                            against West Berlin, a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> country or
                            Austria would present an extremely grave situation; Soviet moves in
                            other areas would be less serious but still grave.</p>

                            of great importance to make clear to the Soviet Union that an act

                                facs="0570"/>would lead to counter-action. The Secretary replied

                            mid-November will show a clear response on the part of <gloss

                            together and the days of a response by the U.S. alone are over. For
                            example, during the 1961 Berlin crisis the U.S. added $6 billion to its
                            defense budget, called up reserves and took actions which were not taken
                            by any other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> country. Similarly,
                            we were alone in some actions following the Czechoslovak invasion.
                            Europe cannot say that it is up to the U.S. alone to respond to
                            Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would hope that if the Austrians receive any
                            information or indications of Soviet pressure, they would immediately
                            inform the U.S., Great Britain and France so that we can make clear to
                            the Soviet Union our reaction. In the case of Romania we had felt it
                            necessary to make a public statement<note n="6" xml:id="d204fn6"

                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that the Soviets certainly could have predicted the
                            disadvantages which would accrue from their intervention in
                            Czechoslovakia—unfavorable publicity in Czechoslovakia, division among
                            the Eastern Europeans, splits in Western Communist parties. They were
                            willing to pay this price and this may indicate a willingness to move
                            back to the cold war days in the Kremlin. Another explanation may lie in
                            the fact that committee actions, such as are required within the present
                            Soviet Government, make it difficult for an individual to oppose the
                            majority view and this may have a bearing on future moves. It is clear
                            that the Soviets have become afraid of peaceful co-existence.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary added that the Soviet Government may now realize that its
                            intervention in Czechoslovakia has developed badly and cannot survive
                            without far reaching changes. The Soviets face problems with their youth
                            and with minority national groups. They must continually deal with
                            nostalgia in Eastern European countries for ties to the West. These
                            factors have created a difficult situation and their awareness of the
                            situation causes them to be nervous and afraid and they are therefore
                            dangerous.</p>

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_WK1">Waldheim</persName> responded that
                            the Austrian judgment of the present situation is similar. However,
                            while the Austrians see no danger in the immediate future, they are
                            concerned about long-run developments, particularly in connection with
                            hostilities in the Middle East. If war breaks out again in the Middle
                            East the Soviets can be expected to make further moves in Eastern

                        <p>He agreed that it was necessary for the U.S. and Austria to keep in close
                            touch regarding any increases in Soviet pressures against Austria. He
                            said that he had been asked about guarantees of Austrian neutrality and
                            had responded that the obligations in the State Treaty are sufficient
                            for that purpose. It is clear to the Soviet Union that an action against
                            Austria would bring on a new war and there is therefore no necessity for
                            any further guarantee.</p>

                            information on Finnish interest in Drakens as follows: (1) Ministry of

                            (2) on this basis and on own initiative, Maj. Gen. Artola discussed
                            purchase possibilities with Swedes, which precipitated contact with
                            Hughes Aircraft concerning availability Falcon Missile System; (3)
                            Artola's superiors considered this action premature, and Artola was told
                            to take no further action; (4) subsequently, National Defense Council
                            approved inclusion 10 Drakens in budget which will be before Parliament
                            in September, this decision of course being contingent upon availability
                            and acceptable terms, including credit element; (5) Lt. Gen. Maunula,
                            when in Sweden beginning May 25 on return of Swedish Chief of Gen. Staff
                            earlier visit to Finland, will visit Saab Plant and discuss Draken

                            might require replanning of which Drakens might conceivably be victim;

                            <gloss target="#t_AIRA1">AIRA</gloss> primary source states that 1965

                            Finnish military's long-range objective of total replacement of Migs has
                            been given or even sought. Our impression is that Finnish military
                            considers acquisition of initial ten as opening wedge, with fulfillment
                            of long-range objective being contingent upon performance Drakens and

                            should be pursued through more shaded avenues. Furthermore, given
                            decided preference for Drakens on part Finns, believe it best to let
                            Finns explore whether they can both have and afford them on own time

                        </list>
                        <p>On December 29, I received a copy of a memorandum from Bill Tyler to you
                            on the above subject.<note n="2" xml:id="d207fn2">A copy of the
                                memorandum is ibid.</note> After expressing his strong support for
                            meeting Finnish interest in Falcon-equipped Drakens, he asks several
                            questions concerning the Falcon missile system which, as you know, is of
                            U.S. origin.</p>
                        <p>I have now been able to obtain the following information which addresses
                            points raised by Mr. Tyler on the equipment itself: <list>
                                <label>(a)</label>
                                <item>The Falcon missile system provided to the Swedish Government
                                    is a modified version of the U.S. Air Force air-to-air missile,
                                    the GAR–11. The modification as furnished, however, continues to
                                    provide a capability in excess of that of any known foreign
                                    system, including that provided to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                        >NATO</gloss>. The classification of components is Secret
                                    and “Very Sensitive” Confidential. The Air Force advises, in
                                    addition, that further modification of the system is not
                                    technically feasible without negating the basic capability of
                                    the equipment.</item>
                                <label>(b)</label>
                                <item>Air Force intelligence advises, moreover, that the Soviet
                                    Union utilizes an air-to-air missile system which is inferior to
                                    that provided to the Swedes. Accordingly, compromise of this
                                    equipment would contribute to Soviet air defense
                                    state-of-the-art. Access to its componentry and technical data
                                    would, as well, provide the Soviets with the means for devising
                                    a system to counter current U.S. Air Force air-to-air missile
                                    capabilities. The Air Force conclusion that release of the
                                    Falcon missile to Finland would be harmful to U.S. interests is
                                    inter alia predicated on the fact that both the Swedish HM–55
                                    and the U.S. GAR–11 contain advanced technology currently unique
                                    to Western equipment.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Although the above solely seeks to address equipment sensitivity,
                            necessarily, concern with respect to the Finnish security system has the
                            most direct relevance in the premises. Should the Department consider it
                            to be sufficiently worthwhile, I can arrange for the US–MICC to assess
                            the capability of the Finnish security program to protect U.S.-origin
                            classified equipment and information.</p>

                            with President Kekkonen June 1 President stated emphatically that there
                            would be no change in Finnish foreign policy as result elections and
                            formation new government. He added that election results had surprised

                            promises made by Social Democrats in course of election campaign no
                            substantial change in prospect with respect economic and social policies
                            since resources simply not available for expansion of social
                            expenditures. He mentioned in this connection continuing Finnish balance

                        <p>2. Secretary told President that in conversations with Prime Minister
                            Paasio and FonMin Karjalainen he had stressed President <persName

                            world needs. He had also discussed our concern with success of Kennedy
                            Round. In this connection Secretary pointed out that unless there is
                            some progress by February it will be very difficult to obtain
                            Congressional approval for extension of Trade Expansion Act. Secretary
                            said we had been working hard with <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            countries who were key to problem. Unless we are able to take step
                            forward we are in danger of going backward. President
                                <persName>Kennedy</persName> had made far reaching decision in
                            seeking and obtaining legislative authority represented by Trade
                            Expansion Act. Congressional disillusionment and rising protectionist
                            sentiment could produce reaction none of us wants. Kekkonen, while
                            expressing general agreement with importance of progress of Kennedy
                            Round negotiations remarked that six months is a short period in which
                            to achieve results. Secretary replied that the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"

                            years.</p>
                        <p>3. The Secretary asked for Kekkonen's comments on the new leadership in
                            the Sov Union. Kekkonen replied that he had had a warm personal
                            relationship with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> but
                            noted, approvingly, that the new Sov leaders appeared disposed to follow
                            a calm, practical and unsentimental foreign policy. He said that Viet
                            Nam and Germany are two preoccupations of the Sov leaders. So far as
                            Viet Nam is concerned the Sov Union may be not unpleased with current
                            United States involvement but <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0578"
                            />concerned that it might expand and involve them. He thought that Sov
                            concern about Germany is somewhat less acute now that the prospect of
                                <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> seems to have receded.</p>
                        <p>4. The Secretary in discussing Viet Nam reviewed our efforts to persuade
                            the other side to come to the conference table and the efforts which we
                            have made to this end with Moscow, Hanoi and Peking and in virtually all
                            world capitals. He also referred to the lack of positive response to our
                            two bombing pauses. We are still ready to negotiate but at the same time
                            we remain faithful to our commitments and will not be pushed out of
                            Southeast Asia. If the aggressor rejects peace we are prepared to do
                            what is required.</p>
                        <p>5. The Secretary suggested that in his opinion a sound position for a
                            non-aligned or neutral country to adopt is support for a settlement on
                            the basis of the 1954 and 1962 agreements<note n="3" xml:id="d209fn3"
                                >Reference is to the July 1954 Geneva Accords and the Declaration
                                and Protocol on the Neutrality of Laos, signed at Geneva on July 23,
                                1962.</note> and for differences regarding these agreements to be
                            resolved peacefully rather than by force.</p>
                        <p>6. Kekkonen said Finland has been in close touch with the other
                            Scandinavian countries and is mindful that there may come a time when
                            some initiative will be helpful in promoting a settlement of the Viet
                            Nam problem. He indicated that in his view that time has not yet
                            come.</p>
                        <p>7. Amb <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Llewellyn Thompson</persName> referred
                            to the recent purges in Communist China and asked whether the Finnish
                            Ambassador in Peking had submitted an analysis of the significance of
                            these developments. Kekkonen replied that there had been no detailed
                            report from the Finnish Ambassador as yet. He added that the Ambassador,
                            who is a particularly able observer, believes the Sino-Sov dispute has
                            now passed the point of no return. In this connection he noted that in
                            his previous discussions with the Soviet leaders they had avoided
                            commenting on the Sov differences with Communist China. On his last
                            visit to Moscow, however, <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName>, in response to his question, said that
                            Sino-Soviet government relations were bad and party relations broken.
                            Kekkonen told the Secretary that Kosygin will be visiting Finland from
                            June 13 until June 18.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MO1">Munkki</persName> reported that,
                            from the Finnish point of view, the Secretary's recent trip to Finland
                            (May 31–June 2) was a complete success. The discussions between the
                            Secretary and President Kekkonen, as well as members of the newly formed
                            coalition government, were useful and friendly even if the principals
                            did not agree in detail on everything.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador did not dwell on the Kosygin visit to Finland (June 13–18)
                            since Foreign Minister Karjalainen reported fully on the visit to
                            Ambassador Tyler Thompson on June 27.<note n="2" xml:id="d210fn2"

                                USSR)</note> When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1"
                                >Stoessel</persName> noted that the cancellation of Kosygin's visit
                            to Sweden and Polyansky's early return to Moscow from Ottawa apparently
                            was caused by the need to deal with the continuing Warsaw Pact problems
                            and the early August session of the Supreme Soviet, the Ambassador
                            observed that Polyansky was, in his opinion, a “coming man.” He
                            expressed surprise that Kosygin dealt with unusual frankness with the
                            Peking-Moscow rift during his press conference in Helsinki, when he
                            admitted that relations were very bad and that party relations were
                            non-existent.</p>
                        <p>In reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>'s
                            question about the real significance of the Kosygin visit to Finland,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MO1">Munkki</persName> described it simply as
                            a confirmation of the amicable relations which have characterized the
                            recent relations of the two countries.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MO1">Munkki</persName> put the best
                            possible light on the participation of Communists in the Finnish
                            Government for the first time since 1948. As he had predicted just
                            before leaving Washington on May 25 (government formed May 27) the three
                            Communist-front SKDL members received non-critical positions in the
                            Finance, Social Affairs, and Transport and Public Works Ministries. They
                            thus will have to deal with such unpleasant problems as civil service
                            wage policy and with price administration. <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552"
                                facs="0580"/>The representation of the SKDL in the Cabinet also
                            gives added security of tenure to a government which will have to
                            undertake some unpopular measures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> noted that President
                            Kekkonen had visited Norway shortly after the Kosygin visit, but the
                            Ambassador offered no further information than that it was a successful
                            fishing trip.</p>
                        <p>Replying to the Ambassador's inquiry about the Brussels Ministerial
                            Meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> reviewed
                            briefly the decisions taken at this meeting. He noted the continuing
                            interest here, as well as among our <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> partners, in increased contacts with Eastern Europe.
                            He confirmed that the idea of a European Security Conference, such as
                            the Danes had suggested, had been rejected by the other <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members as premature and that
                            apparently <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had reacted
                            coolly to a similar proposal made during his visit to Moscow. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MO1">Munkki</persName> agreed that such a
                            conference would not be fruitful in the absence of more concrete advance
                            plans to solve the present division of Europe. In his opinion, matters
                            would improve if the West German Social Democrats got a larger voice in
                            Bonn. He added that President Kekkonen and Foreign Minister Karjalainen
                            were very unhappy over West German Defense Minister Von Hassel's recent
                            comment that the Finnish-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Mutual
                            Assistance (1948)<note n="3" xml:id="d210fn3">For text, see 48 UNTS
                                149.</note> was only an amicable agreement without obligations.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that there is much pessimism in Finland over the
                            prospects for the Kennedy Round, particularly over the intransigence of
                            the Six. For Finland, he said, the big question is paper and pulp.
                            Finland, of course, accepts the principles of the Kennedy Round but
                            feels that it must have some of its own interests recognized, at least
                            in matters affecting pulp and paper.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MO1">Munkki</persName> noted, perhaps
                            prematurely, he said, that Finnair President Korhonen will be
                            negotiating with <persName>Douglas</persName> Aircraft Co. for the
                            purchase of two of the “stretched” DC–8's, with an option for a third,
                            costing about $20 million altogether. If the sale can be arranged the
                            first plane would be delivered in 1968 and the second in 1969.
                            Unfortunately, the news of Finnair's interest in the DC–8 leaked to the
                            press and the British already have started their sales offensive for the
                            Super VC–10. This will make for a touchy situation for, although Finnair
                            prefers the enlarged DC–8, the British are willing to use Finland's
                            export surplus with Britain as a lever to develop sales of the
                            VC–10.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MO1">Munkki</persName> said that he had
                            requested the meeting because he planned to leave Washington for a
                            vacation in the Caribbean and Finland, and would be away until the first
                            of the year.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he had conveyed his Government's views on
                            European economic integration to Deputy Assistant Secretary Greenwald
                            during his November 12 meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d211fn2">No

                            a relationship between <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> and the EC,
                            but that the Finnish Government wanted to make clear its view that any
                            agreement reached must be in accord with the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss>. The Ambassador said that his Government did not find
                            the French proposal interesting, particularly as it did not include
                            paper. The Ambassador summarized the Finnish attitude as cooperative but
                            reserved. He noted that the Swiss appeared to be the most eager on this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that, after the Brussels <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                                595–597.</note> there had been a considerable amount of concern in
                            Finland because of press speculation that had placed Finland in the
                            “grey area.” The Ambassador noted that the Moscow press was now writing
                            on this topic. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> told the
                            Ambassador that all of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            governments are aware of Finland's sensitivities in this regard. He
                            agreed that the press speculation, both here and in Europe, had been
                            less than helpful. He noted that the Bonn release had also proven
                            detrimental. The USSR, he observed, was particularly sensitive to this
                            sort of statement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName>
                            stressed that great care had been taken in the drafting of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué to avoid the sort of
                            misinterpretation in which some sectors of the press were now
                            indulging.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MO1">Munkki</persName> said that he
                            wished to express his appreciation for the assurances given his Embassy
                            by <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>/SCAN to the effect that,
                            newspaper speculation to the contrary, there was little cause for
                            Finland's fear that it had been placed in the “grey area” at the
                            Brussels <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting. Notwithstanding
                            such formal assurances, the Ambassador said that Foreign Minister
                            Karjalainen had asked if he could have a transcript or summary of the
                            Secretary's address in Brussels. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1"
                                >Leddy</persName> told the Ambassador that he did not think it would
                            be possible to provide the Foreign Minister with a text of the
                            Secretary's <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> address. He said that
                            he would, however, discuss the matter with the Secretary and, if the
                            latter agreed, give Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MO1"
                                >Munkki</persName> an oral statement that might be helpful to
                            him.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then raised the matter of the interview given by Herman
                            Kahn on French television, in which Mr. Kahn, President of the Hudson
                            Institute, stated that the United States had withdrawn its protection
                            from Finland and had, in effect, dropped Finland off the map. The
                            Ambassador asked what, if any, were Mr. Kahn's connections with the
                            State Department. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said
                            that he would attempt to get the text of Mr. Kahn's remarks and that,
                            subsequently, he might be able to comment on this matter.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MO1">Munkki</persName> next informed Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> that the
                            Non-Proliferation Treaty is now before the Finnish Parliament. Approval,
                            he said, is expected before Christmas.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName>, in reply to the
                            Ambassador's question about U.S. ratification, said that he did not know
                            if there would be a special session of the Senate. The treaty would, he
                            said, be the Senate's first order of business when it did convene.<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d211fn5">The Senate approved the treaty on March 13,
                                1969. For text, see 21 UST 483.</note> Both the President-elect and
                            the Senate leadership place high importance on the treaty. There was no
                            doubt but that the treaty would be approved by a large majority. The
                            Soviet Union will not, he said, move on this matter until the United
                            States acts. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> explained
                            that, while there was very little debate involved in Soviet approval,
                            the USSR appears to like to maintain a sort of parity in such matters,
                            as they did when they matched our delay in ratifying the consular
                            convention.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the Ambassador's question about the Balkan situation, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said that we had no
                            information at present that would lead us to anticipate any new
                            developments in this area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1"
                                >Leddy</persName> said that the Yugoslavians are still quite
                            concerned. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> noted that
                            the recent Bucharest meeting of the Warsaw Pact and the reported
                            Romanian agreement to allow maneuvers in their country next year may
                            have served to satisfy the USSR. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1"
                                >Leddy</persName>, in reply to a question from the <pb n="555"
                                xml:id="pg_555" facs="0583"/>Ambassador, said that the recent
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> protest to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>, concerning <gloss

                            arguments; i.e., why does the U.S. maintain a fleet far from home in the
                            Mediterranean, etc. We do not, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1"
                                >Leddy</persName> noted, attach too much importance to such
                            protests.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador noted that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            appears ready to return home. He had, the Ambassador said, asked the

                        <p>As the meeting ended, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName>
                            said that we would be communicating with the Ambassador during the
                            coming week concerning the Foreign Minister's request for a copy of the
                            Secretary's <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> address and the Herman
                            Kahn interview.<note n="7" xml:id="d211fn7">The pertinent passage of the
                                Kahn interview (taped in New York by BBC and the French Television

                                In addition, Amembassy Helsinki was instructed to tell the Foreign

                                crossed the country off the map.”]</note>
