                <p>The operation to overthrow Guatemalan President <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1"
                        >Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán</persName> in 1954, a decisive event in U.S. relations
                    with Latin America early in the cold war, is the topic of a retrospective volume
                    of the Department of State’s official documentary history, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>, released on May 15, 2003. As
                    part of a sub-series of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series that
                    documents the foreign policy of <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D.
                        Eisenhower</persName>’s administration, this retrospective volume
                    supplements the 1983 publication of <ref target="frus1952-54v04"><hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>, 1952–1954,
                        Volume IV, American Republics</ref>. The 1983 volume—which covered
                    multilateral and bilateral relations with 20 American republics—provided an
                    incomplete history of U.S. relations with Guatemala by not documenting the U.S.
                    Government-approved role of the Central Intelligence Agency in the ouster of
                        <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>.</p>
                <p>Partly in response to this omission, Congress passed legislation in 1991, which
                    the President signed, mandating that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series “shall be a thorough, accurate, and reliable
                    documentary record of major United States foreign policy decisions and
                    significant United States diplomatic activity” and requiring U.S. Government
                    departments and agencies to provide Department of State historians with “full
                    and complete access to the records pertinent to United States foreign policy
                    decisions and actions.”</p>
                <p>In the early 1990s, Directors of Central Intelligence officially acknowledged 11
                    covert actions during the early cold war years, including the one in Guatemala.
                    At the same time, Department of State historians gained
                        <persName>fuller</persName> access to the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                        >CIA</gloss>’s files on Guatemala. The new volume is a product of this
                    improved access. The Central Intelligence Agency has reviewed the volume for
                    declassification, in coordination with its review of a larger collection of
                    documents on the Guatemalan operation that it is releasing to the public at the
                    National Archives.</p>
                <p>This new volume, a selection of the most significant documents, fills in many
                    details about the role of the United States in Guatemala in the early 1950s and
                    provides an accurate account of U.S. policy toward Guatemala. The operation in
                    Guatemala is an important instance of the use of covert action to implement U.S.
                    foreign policy, and this volume provides a detailed account of that action. The
                    new volume does not reprint documents from the 1983 <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> publication, although footnotes and editorial notes refer
                    back to significant documents in that earlier volume.</p>
                <p>The retrospective volume on Guatemala, 1952–1954, relies primarily on
                    documentation of the Directorate of Operations (DO) at the Central Intelligence
                    Agency. Most of the DO documentation includes extensive records for <gloss

                    ousting <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>; <gloss

                        >Arbenz</persName> government. The volume includes correspondence,
                    memoranda, and cable traffic among <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                    Headquarters, <gloss target="#t_PBSPBSUCCESS1">PBSUCCESS</gloss> Headquarters in
                    Florida, and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Stations including Guatemala,
                    and between the Department of State and the Embassy in Guatemala. Also included
                    are documents from the <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">John Foster Dulles</persName>
                    Papers at the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>
                    Presidential Library that were not printed in the 1983 compilation.</p>
                <p>To facilitate research, both the new volume and the 1983 compilation are
                    available on the Office of the Historian website. Copies of the new volume can

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with responsibility for the preparation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The General Editor and the
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, plan, research, select, and edit the
                    volumes in the series. Official regulations codifying specific standards for the
                    selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State <persName>Frank B. Kellogg</persName> on March 26, 1925.
                    These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President <persName>George Bush</persName> on
                    October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the
                    Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, <hi
                        rend="italic">et seq</hi>.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                        <persName>Kellogg</persName>: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and accuracy;
                    records should not be altered or deletions made without indicating in the
                    published text that a deletion has been made; the published record should omit
                    no facts that were of major importance in reaching a decision; and nothing
                    should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute
                    also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    published not more than 30 years after the events recorded.</p>

                <p>This volume is part of a sub-series of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the foreign policy of the
                    administration of <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>.
                    It is a supplement to the 1983 publication of <ref target="frus1952-54v04"><hi

                        facs="0008"/>The historian who collected and prepared the volume knew that
                    the compilation on Guatemala as published was incomplete and flawed. The role of
                    the Central Intelligence Agency in the ouster of Guatemala’s elected president,
                        <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán</persName>, was not
                    documented in the volume.</p>
                <p>The historian responsible for the volume gained some access to <gloss
                        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> records of the operation. He inserted
                    references to the covert operation into the Guatemala compilation, but they were
                    denied in the declassification process. Despite internal debate, the Office of
                    the Historian published the volume without the inclusion of a disclaimer
                    indicating that the published documentation on Guatemala provided an incomplete
                    and distorted history. Critical reviews of the compilation appeared in academic
                    journals and major newspapers.</p>
                <p>Partly in response to these criticisms, in 1991 Congress passed legislation that
                    the President signed affirming that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series “shall be a thorough, accurate, and reliable documentary record of major
                    United States foreign policy decisions and significant United States diplomatic
                    activity” and requiring U.S. Government departments and agencies to provide
                    Department of State historians with “full and complete access to the records
                    pertinent to United States foreign policy decisions and actions.” To help ensure
                    that future volumes meet these legislative standards, the same law also gave the
                    Department of State’s Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation,
                    consisting of six academic historians as well as a political scientist, an
                    archivist, and an international lawyer, authority to advise and make
                    recommendations to The Historian of the Department on “all aspects of
                    preparation and publication of the FRUS series.”</p>
                <p>In the early 1990s, Directors of Central Intelligence officially acknowledged
                    eleven covert actions during the early cold war years, including Guatemala. At
                    the same time, Department of State historians gained <persName>fuller</persName>
                    access to the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s files on Guatemala. This
                    volume is a product of improved access. The Central Intelligence Agency has
                    reviewed the volume for declassification in coordination with its review of
                    documents on the Guatemala operation being released to the National
                    Archives.</p>
                <p>This volume fills in many details about the role of the United States in
                    Guatemala in the early 1950s. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> operation
                    in Guatemala is an important instance of the use of covert action to implement
                    U.S. foreign policy, and this volume provides a detailed account of that action.
                    Because the focus of this volume is on a covert program, the documents published
                    in the 1952–1954 American Republics volume are not reprinted here, but footnotes
                    and editorial notes refer back to the more significant overt aspects covered in
                    the volume published in 1983. The two <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0009"
                    />volumes complement each other and should be read together for a full and
                    comprehensive account. To facilitate research the Guatemala compilation from

                    website.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is convinced that the Central Intelligence Agency has

                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors
                    for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
                    each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were excised. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. All brackets that appear in
                    the source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document’s source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides
                    the background of important documents and <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0010"
                    />policies and indicates whether the President or his major policy advisers read
                    the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs, other first-hand accounts, and monographs has been used when
                    appropriate to supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                        Documentation</hi></p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, reviews records, advises,
                    and makes recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series. The Advisory Committee monitors the overall
                    compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all aspects of
                    the preparation and declassification of the series. The Advisory Committee does
                    not attempt to review the contents of individual volumes in the series, but it
                    makes recommendations on problems that come to its attention. The Committee
                    reviews volumes when it considers a review necessary to fulfill its obligations
                    under the statute.</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee has reviewed this volume.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Declassification Review</hi></p>
                <p>The Information Response Branch of the Office of Information Resources Management
                    Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration, Department of State, conducted
                    the declassification review of the documents published in this volume. The
                    review was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth in Executive
                    Order 12958 on Classified National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments.</p>
                <p>The final declassification review of this volume, which began in 1999 and was
                    completed in 2002, resulted in the decision to withhold 2 <pb n="VII"
                        xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0011"/>documents in full; excise a paragraph or more
                    from 9 documents and make minor excisions, mostly names and places, in 190 of
                    the 287 documents published. The editor is confident, on the basis of the
                    research conducted in preparing this volume, that the documentation and
                    editorial notes presented here provide an accurate account of U.S. policy toward
                    Guatemala.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    engaged in foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the
                    Department of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records
                    pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of
                    selected records. Almost all of the sources consulted in the preparation of this
                    volume have been declassified in full or in part and are available for review at
                    the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between
                    the President and Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of
                    overseas diplomatic posts. All the Department’s indexed central files for these
                    years have been permanently transferred to the National Archives and Records
                    Administration at College Park, Maryland (Archives II). The Department’s
                    decentralized office (or lot) files covering this period that the National
                    Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred from the

                <p>This retrospective volume on Guatemala, 1952–1954, is a documentary history of
                        <gloss target="#t_PBSPBSUCCESS1">PBSUCCESS</gloss>, the Central Intelligence
                    Agency operation <pb n="XII" xml:id="pg_XII" facs="0016"/>leading to the 1954
                    coup that removed President <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Jacobo Arbenz
                        Guzmán</persName> from power. As such, this volume relies primarily on
                    documents of the Directorate of Operations (DO) at the Central Intelligence
                    Agency. Most of the DO documentation is in Job 79–01025A, a collection that
                    includes extensive records for <gloss target="#t_PBFORTUNE1">PBFORTUNE</gloss>,
                    an initial plan first considered in 1951 to oust <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1"

                        >Arbenz</persName> government. The majority of the documentation in Job
                    79–01025A is comprised of internal memoranda and cable traffic, especially
                    telegrams to and from Central Intelligence Agency Headquarters (<gloss
                        target="#t_DIR1">DIR</gloss> cables), <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                    Stations including Guatemala (GUAT cables), and <gloss target="#t_PBSPBSUCCESS1"
                        >PBSUCCESS</gloss> Headquarters in Florida (<gloss target="#t_LINC1"
                        >LINC</gloss> cables). Additionally Job 79–01025A contains many
                    Agency-generated internal memoranda and intelligence studies, most of it
                    originating in the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s Western Hemisphere
                    Division.</p>
                <p>Job 79–01025A also includes correspondence, memoranda, and cables to and from
                    Central Intelligence Agency Headquarters, the Department of State, and the
                    United States Embassy in Guatemala. The volume includes a few documents from the
                        <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">John Foster Dulles</persName> Papers at the
                        <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName> Presidential

                        IV, American Republics</ref> (1983). This retrospective volume supplements

                        >Eisenhower</persName> administration and together the two volumes provide a

                    both as it was agreed upon in Washington and as it was implemented in Central

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>By the beginning of the 20th century, Guatemala had evolved into a highly
                    stratified society in which a tiny minority of elite coffee growers, linked to
                    the country’s ruling Liberal regime, gained increasing control over land and
                    labor. Almost completely dependent on the production of a single export
                    commodity, coffee, and subject to the vicissitudes of international markets,
                    Guatemala’s economy nearly collapsed with the onset of the Great Depression.
                    Economic instability led to social and political unrest, particularly in
                    Guatemala City, where bankruptcies and unemployment began to spiral out of
                    control. In 1931 Guatemala’s elite united to restore order and turned to the
                    rule of a strongman or caudillo, <persName>Jorge Ubico Castañeda</persName>, to
                    restore social stability and economic growth.</p>
                <p><persName>Ubico</persName> was given virtually unchecked powers, and upon
                    assuming office he suspended constitutional guarantees and crushed all
                    opposition, particularly from organized labor. To restore order he mandated
                    rigid and summary enforcement of the law. Utilizing forced labor, often drafted
                    from among the ranks of prisoners, he constructed public buildings, expanded
                    road networks, and carried out public projects. To stabilize the economy,
                        <persName>Ubico</persName> staunchly defended private property and
                    landowners’ legal rights to a guaranteed labor supply. He ensured this labor
                    supply through new vagrancy laws which, while officially outlawing debt peonage,
                    effectively reinforced it. In the public sector, he rooted out corruption,
                    drastically cut government spending, and balanced the national budget; middle
                    class bureaucrats bore the brunt of such austerity measures.</p>
                <p><persName>Ubico</persName> proved to be a staunch political and economic ally of
                    the United States. When <persName>Pearl Harbor</persName> was attacked in
                    December 1941, he declared war on Japan, Italy, and Germany. In support of the
                    war effort, he eagerly welcomed the stationing of American troops in Guatemala
                    and moved to dispossess German immigrants of their lands.
                        <persName>Ubico</persName> was also a friend to American businesses in
                    Guatemala. In particular he maintained amicable relations with the United Fruit
                    Company, honoring contracts made with the company during the previous 30 years,
                    while allowing the company to bow out of a contractual obligation to build a
                    Pacific coast port.</p>
                <p>By the mid-1940s the economy had fully stabilized and the country enjoyed
                    substantial economic growth, which in turn contributed to the increasing
                    emergence of a small, but clearly identifiable and upwardly mobile middle class.
                    Inspired by <persName>Franklin D. Roosevelt</persName>’s Four <pb n="XXIV"
                        xml:id="pg_XXIV" facs="0028"/>Freedoms and the war against fascism and
                    dictatorship in Europe and the Pacific, Guatemala’s emergent middle class
                    increasingly demanded political change within the country. When
                        <persName>Ubico</persName> announced that he would remain in office until at
                    least 1949, both the middle and upper classes protested. Students, bureaucrats
                    and even junior military officers began to openly demand that the dictator step
                    down. On July 1, 1944, <persName>Ubico</persName> yielded to this pressure and
                    surrendered power to a junta led by General <persName>Federico Ponce
                        Vaides</persName>. However, <persName>Ponce</persName> lasted only 3
                    months.</p>
                <p>On October 19, 1944, a group of junior army officers, led by Captain <persName
                        corresp="#p_AGJ1">Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán</persName> and Major
                        <persName>Francisco Javier Arana</persName>, led a coup d’etat, ousting
                        <persName>Ponce</persName> and sending <persName>Ubico</persName> into
                    exile. With both <persName>Ubico</persName> and <persName>Ponce</persName> out
                    of the picture, <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> and
                        <persName>Arana</persName> joined with a civilian businessman, <persName
                        corresp="#p_TGG1">Jorge Toriello Garrido</persName>, to form a revolutionary
                    junta, then scheduled presidential elections for December 1944. Although several
                    candidates initially entered the race, by December most of them had stepped
                    aside, leaving <persName>Juan José Arévalo Bermejo</persName> and
                        <persName>Adrian Recinos</persName> (<persName>Ubico</persName>’s former
                    ambassador to the United States). Almost alone in the field,
                        <persName>Arévalo</persName> won the election, receiving 85 percent of the
                    vote.</p>
                <p>When he assumed the presidency in March 1945, <persName>Arévalo</persName>
                    espoused what he termed “spiritual socialism,” a philosophy that promoted
                    nationalism and “freedom of spirit,” while stressing the importance of the
                    “dignity of man.” The new president sought to reinforce this lofty, yet
                    ambiguous philosophy, through the creation of a new constitution, which would
                    protect basic rights, while allowing for moderate reform. Two of the document’s
                    articles had particular significance. Article 91 recognized the right to private
                    property, except under circumstances in which that right might impinge upon the
                    national interest. Article 92 narrowed Article 91’s interpretation by indicating
                    that the government would be legally empowered to expropriate land at any time
                    to fulfill the needs of society at large. Although <persName>Arévalo</persName>
                    never invoked Articles 91 and 92, Guatemala’s landed elite were alarmed at such
                    a possible threat to private property and accused <persName>Arévalo</persName>
                    of succumbing to Communist influence. Even after the president purged his
                    government of rightwing and leftwing extremists in July 1945, the allegations
                    continued. In addition to calling him a Communist, opponents alternately labeled
                        <persName>Arévalo</persName> a fascist or “Communist-fascist.”</p>
                <p>Initial positive U.S. perceptions of the Guatemalan president changed drastically
                    in 1947, when he signed a labor protection law that implicitly targeted the
                    United Fruit Company. Cables from the American Embassy in Guatemala City
                    increasingly sounded the alarming message that <persName>Arévalo</persName> was
                    allowing Communists to organize and had reputedly provided known Communists with
                    support. Claims of <pb n="XXV" xml:id="pg_XXV" facs="0029"
                        /><persName>Arévalo</persName>’s affiliation with Communists gained even
                    greater credence in view of his apparently increasing tolerance of Communist
                    activities in Guatemala and his sponsorship of the Caribbean Legion, a group of
                    ostensibly reformist Latin Americans who plotted to overthrow dictatorships in
                    the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. A 1949 Central
                    Intelligence Agency analysis described the Caribbean Legion as a destabilizing
                    force capable of undermining “democratic” regimes, such as those in Nicaragua
                    and El Salvador.<note n="1" xml:id="prefacefn1"><persName corresp="#p_THS1"
                            >Harry S. Truman</persName> Library, President’s Secretary File, Central
                        Intelligence Agency, “The Caribbean Legion,” ORE 11–49, March 17,
                        1949.</note> Notwithstanding an increasingly unfavorable regional and
                    domestic climate, <persName>Arévalo</persName> completed his full term of
                    office.</p>
                <p>When elections finally came in 1950, <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Jacobo Arbenz
                        Guzmán</persName>, one of the members of the revolutionary junta of 1944,
                    ran almost unopposed on a platform that advocated agrarian reform. When he
                    assumed office in early 1951, <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>
                    inherited a country that had changed little during
                    <persName>Arévalo</persName>’s tenure and remained a seeming economic paradox.
                    Compared with its Central American neighbors, Guatemala was a rich country. It
                    enjoyed the region’s highest gross domestic product (GDP), a per capita GDP
                    second only to Costa Rica, and the strongest currency (stable and at par with
                    the United States dollar) in the region. By 1945 Guatemala had established
                    regional economic dominance in export agriculture, mining and quarrying, and
                    manufacturing. However, in spite of its impressive economic performance, the
                    country suffered from a highly skewed distribution of resources, which
                    contributed to widespread indigence. A mere 2 percent of the population
                    controlled more than 72 percent of Guatemala’s arable land. Of all privately
                    held land, less than 12 percent was being cultivated. In a country dedicated
                    primarily to agriculture, this translated into sweeping poverty and
                    malnutrition.</p>
                <p>From the outset of his presidency, <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>
                    attempted to tackle Guatemala’s socioeconomic ills through a major agrarian
                    reform. Guatemalan Communists—members of the Guatemalan Labor Party (PGT)—were
                    quick to support the new president’s efforts. While <persName>Arévalo</persName>
                    had been hesitant to work with the Communists, <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1"
                        >Arbenz</persName> welcomed their participation, and in late 1951 he
                    secretly met with them to draw up an agrarian reform law. By May 1952 a draft
                    bill for the reform had been submitted to Guatemala’s National Assembly. The
                    next month, on June 17, 1952, the bill was passed and President <persName
                        corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> promulgated Decree 900, the Agrarian
                    Reform Law. Central to the PGT’s revolutionary agenda, the 1952 law mandated the
                    redistribution of idle lands in excess of 223 acres. Compensation for
                    expropriated <pb n="XXVI" xml:id="pg_XXVI" facs="0030"/>lands was provided in
                    the form of 25 year bonds with 3 percent interest paid at the declared tax value
                    of the lands in question.</p>
                <p>The landed elite vehemently opposed any measure that would challenge their right
                    to private property and immediately began publishing anti-reform pamphlets in
                    which they complained that Communists had infiltrated the government.
                    Complicating the situation, the United Fruit Company immediately recognized
                    that, given its massive land holdings, it would feel the impact of the agrarian
                    reform more than any other entity in the country. In stark contrast to the
                    country’s large landholders, Guatemalan peasants responded exuberantly to the
                    reform. Indeed, for some the land redistribution did not move quickly enough;
                    they resorted to land seizure and the occupation of large plantations.</p>
                <p>As early as 1951—well before an agrarian reform law could be written, much less
                    passed—the Central Intelligence Agency was already drawing up a contingency plan
                    (code-named <gloss target="#t_PBFORTUNE1">PBFORTUNE</gloss>) to oust <persName
                        corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>. In the Agency’s view, <persName
                        corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>’s toleration for known Communists made
                    him at best a “fellow traveler,” and at worst a Communist himself. The social
                    unrest that accompanied the passage and implementation of the Agrarian Reform
                    Law supplied critics in Guatemala and Washington with confirmation that a
                    Communist beachhead had been established in the Americas. Agrarian reform was
                    not the issue—communism was. Action had to be taken before it was too late.
                    Under orders from the State Department, <gloss target="#t_PBFORTUNE1"
                        >PBFORTUNE</gloss> and related contingency planning were supplanted by
                        <gloss target="#t_PBSPBSUCCESS1">PBSUCCESS</gloss>, an active plot to oust
                        <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Jacobo Arbenz</persName> and free the hemisphere
                    from the perceived dangers of Soviet-inspired international communism.</p>

                            Somoza</persName> visited Washington unofficially and told aides to

                        able to take care of the Guatemalan problem if they were furnished with
                        military weapons. The prospective rebels had financial backing from
                        Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, as well as the United Fruit Company.

                    <p>A Central Intelligence Agency draft paper of September 4, 1953, provides a
                        history of the early days of the Guatemalan operation. It states: “In
                        November 1951 the first of many meetings was held between Agency officials
                        and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                        that in early 1952, after a careful survey of anti-Communist Guatemalan
                        revolutionary leaders, “<gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss>,” an early
                        cryptonym for <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName>, was
                        judged to be the only one with “sufficient prestige, character, and ability
                        to organize and lead a successful revolution.” The plan was reviewed and
                        approved; a D-day of November 15, 1952, was selected, and other states in
                        the region offered assistance. “All went well until the shipment had
                        actually left the warehouse en route to New Orleans. The Department of State
                        refused an export license and at a meeting attended by the Under Secretary
                        of State, his Deputy, the Assistant Secretary for Latin America, and
                        representatives of this Agency, refusal of permit was sustained and a
                        directive given that we were not to spark any revolutionary movement.”

                    <p>Action was rescheduled for April 1953, but an unconnected group led by
                            <persName>Carlos Simmons</persName> attempted a revolt at Salamá, which
                        “led to disaster for those involved” and the arrest of one of <persName
                            corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName>’ key supporters. After the
                        incident at Salamá, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> briefing paper
                        indicated, a general apathy and fear apparently weakened the “spirit of
                        resistance and willingness to fight of the 10,000 five-man cells” reportedly
                        organized within Guatemala. The paper admitted that the original military
                        plan “would have little or no chance of success if launched immediately,”
                        but <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0032"/>argued that it would be possible to
                        increase the odds to 80 percent in 4 to 6 months. It was recommended that
                        “the trigger only be pulled if and when this prerequisite of 80% has been
                        achieved.” (<ref target="frus1952-54v04#pg_1369">Ibid</ref>.)</p>

                    <p>The Communists continue to be very active in Guatemala and continue to
                        receive government support. Since the anti-Communist rioting in July 1951
                        the Communists have softened their overt campaign for immediate action in
                        the political field, but they have forged ahead in the labor movement,
                        succeeding in forming, under the guidance of <persName>Vicente Lombardo
                            Toledano</persName> and <persName>Louis Saillant</persName>, a central
                        labor organization comprising almost all the unions in the country. The
                        Communist newspaper <hi rend="italic">Octubre</hi> is published regularly
                        and circulates freely. It has devoted its columns to anti-United States
                        propaganda and to trying to aggravate the United Fruit Company’s labor
                        troubles. The Guatamalan Communists are small in number, but their influence
                        in both government and labor is substantial.</p>

                    <p>The Anti-Communist Party of Guatemala has been formed since the July rioting
                        and has received strong support from the Catholic middle class and from
                        Indians. The university students have furnished leadership to form a
                        substantial bloc in the Party. They have requested <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3"

                    <p>Communist influence in the Guatemalan government continues to be serious.
                        Rumors persist in Guatemala that President <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1"
                            >Arbenz</persName> is ill with leukemia. Efforts to verify these rumors
                        are being made. In the event that <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1"
                            >Arbenz</persName> were forced to leave his office, <persName>Roberto
                            Alvenado Fuentes</persName>, president of the Guatemalan congress, could
                        constitutionally assume presidency. Such an eventuality would further
                        aggravate the situation in Guatemala because <persName>Alvenado

                                increase the Administration’s dependence on and favor toward
                                organized labor, with a consequent increase in Communist influence.
                                However, an economic crisis might force the Government to turn
                                against the Communists in order to save its political position. On
                                the other hand, it is unlikely that the Communists could come
                                directly to power during 1952, even though the incapacitation of

                            free Guatemala from the military dictatorship, social backwardness, and
                            “economic colonialism” which had been the pattern of the past. These

                            successful in stigmatizing all criticism of the Administration as
                            opposition to the principles of the Revolution of 1944. So long as it
                            remains possible to discredit opposition to Communism by identifying it
                            with opposition to the Revolution of 1944 and with support of foreign
                            “colonialism,” it is unlikely that a coherent, sustained, and effective
                            opposition to Communism will develop. Moreover, political
                            dissatisfaction in Guatemala has been strong enough to unify the

                            openly opposing the Communists. For the period of this estimate,
                            therefore, it is likely that the alliance between the Administration and
                            the Communists will continue, and that the potentially powerful

                            Company’s principal Guatemalan plantation by wind storms in September
                            1951. In view of previous Communist-inspired labor troubles, the Company
                            unsuccessfully demanded Government assurances against future increased
                            labor costs before it would undertake to rehabilitate the plantation.
                            Meanwhile the Company suspended some 4,000 out of the 7,000 workers at
                            that plantation. With Government support, the Communist-led union
                            demanded that these workers be reinstated with pay for the period of
                            suspension and the labor court ruled in favor of the union. The Company
                            refused to comply with the court’s decision and in consequence certain
                            of its properties have been attached to satisfy the workers’ claim for
                            back pay. The scheduled sale of these properties <pb n="12"
                                xml:id="pg_12" facs="0042"/>has been postponed, however, in
                            circumstances which suggest the possibility of a compromise settlement
                            of the dispute.</item>

                        <item>The Communists have an obvious ulterior purpose in forcing the issue
                            with the Company. The Government, however, probably does not desire to
                            drive the Company from Guatemala at this time, preferring that it remain
                            in the country on the Government’s terms. The Company’s employees also
                            have an interest in the continuation of its operations. For its part,
                            the Company has an interest in preserving its investment in
                            Guatemala.</item>

                            the Company would continue its operations, paying taxes and wages. The

                            realization of the economic consequences of a cessation of the Company’s
                            operations. It is unlikely, however, that these consequences during 1952
                            would be severe enough to threaten the stability of the regime unless
                            there were a coincident and unrelated decline in coffee production,

                            to increase the Administration’s dependence on and favor toward

                            However, it is unlikely that the Communists could come directly to power
                            during 1952, even though, in case of the incapacitation of President

                            probably move to prevent that development. In particular, the Army
                            command would probably withdraw its support from the Administration and

                            also attempt to subvert or neutralize the Army in order to reduce its

                                    parallel efforts to swing the balance of power to the opposition
                                    will utilize all resources to unite and strengthen the
                                    opposition and weaken the present government. If the Guatemalan
                                    Government does not fall of its own weight it is conceivable
                                    that more direct measures may eventually become necessary, and
                                    planning for such an emergency will proceed. However, at this
                                    time, the primary effort in this field must be directed toward
                                    forestalling any premature attempt to take over the government
                                    by force.</item>

                            Attaché.</p>
                        <p>On Saturday, 27 August 1949, the government police arrested <persName
                                corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName>, Chief of Mazatenango
                            garrison. <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo</persName> was an
                            Aranista. When the government called for him to send troops to the
                            capital on 18 July 1949, he arranged to have his soldiers miss the train
                            which stopped in Mazatenango for them. Following the 18th, he was
                            naturally very much out of favor with the government, and he resigned
                            his army commission and became a civilian. As a civilian he appears to
                            have started organizing a revolutionary movement immediately.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> is well-known for
                            his integrity and patriotism. He has made no secret of his opposition to
                            the present moral corruption of those in power. He has steadfastly
                            refused to accept any position offered by <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1"
                                >Arbenz</persName>, apparently not wishing to compromise his
                            reputation by being associated with the regime.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> led an armed
                            attack on the Military Base the 5th of November 1950. In the attempt, he
                            was wounded. The movement failed, and he was imprisoned.</p>
                        <p>(According to the Air/Attaché—reports say that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> is a very close
                            personal friend of <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>—but the
                            law had to be complied with regarding such revolutionary acts by an
                            officer in the Guatemalan army.)</p>
                        <p>The evening of 11 June 1951, <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo
                                Armas</persName> escaped from the National Prison, took refuge in
                            one of the embassies, and was granted salvo conducto to El Salvador.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Corcoran</persName> had a talk with
                            Monsignor<persName>Carroll</persName>, the purpose of which was to

                        Guatemala, a group of teacher-missionaries who are active young Americans
                        and who have been recalled from China. Much to Mr.
                            <persName>Corcoran</persName>’s surprise, the Monsignor took the
                        position that he had <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0048"/>very little
                        interest in dissipating his strength in Central America; that he needed

                        them here. Mr. <persName>Corcoran</persName> told him that he had no doubt
                        of the useful purpose that could be served by these men in this country but
                        that, in his opinion, the Church had one major enemy today—Communism; that
                        this country was in no immediate danger from that enemy, but that the entire
                        position of the Church in Central and South America was in great danger from
                        that enemy. He asked the Monsignor if he knew <persName corresp="#p_SGWBS1"

                    <p>The growing Communist tendencies of the present Guatemalan Government have
                        alienated the majority of Guatemalans to such an extent that a popular
                        uprising to overthrow the government is to be expected as a normal reaction.
                        Forces supporting the government are confined to the Communists and
                        fellow-travelers and to those members of the Armed Forces and labor who have
                        benefited materially under the present regime. The recent passage of the
                        Agrarian Reform Act, which makes land available to all Guatemalans in the
                        Communist pattern, is expected to win further adherents to the government
                        although it is opposed to the landowning class whose influence will wane as
                        the Act takes effect.</p>

                    <p>Armed action against the government has been planned and pending since early
                        this year and is now imminent. Details of the plan for such action, which
                        follows through to the establishment of a democratic government, are known
                        to us. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] considers that if
                        proper support can be provided the plan is feasible and practical and has a
                        good chance of succeeding if it is put in effect by 1 September 1952.</p>

                        These three are of exceptional ability and character and are fast friends of

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo</persName>’s movement has the moral
                        support of President <persName corresp="#p_SGA1">Somoza</persName> of
                        Nicaragua and of President Galves of Honduras, and it is believed that
                        material support from these two men would be forthcoming if they could be
                        assured of U.S. approval.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo</persName>’s plan envisages moving
                        against the government with clandestine armed forces from the borders of
                        Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras and from the sea on Puerto Barrios in
                        conjunction with internal revolt. He can arm the group in Mexico through
                        purchase of matériel in that country and his other forces have some arms
                        available. However, he will require assistance with matériel from some
                        sources outside the area. His requests for combat air support are not
                        considered to be necessary, but his request for air transport support should
                        be met. His requests for shipping support can be met through procurement in
                        the area. <persName>Simons</persName> can procure arms locally for his part
                        in the action. Considerable local financial support has already been
                        obtained by both <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo</persName> and
                            <persName>Simons</persName>, but further support is indicated. <persName

                        estimated at $175,000 and <persName>Simons</persName>’ at $50,000, to
                        include purchase of arms available in the area.</p>

                            this noon with T. We assured him that, the pros and cons having been
                            weighed, we looked with favor upon a change of management. We told him
                            that we thought his clients, however, should pay the bill as the
                            clients’ interests were materially involved. We stated that we could not
                            be of any help in providing either leadership or manpower because we did
                            not have the people available, but we thought we could be helpful in
                            pointing out where the principals might buy the goods they needed. We
                            further stated that if time were of the essence, we had friends who had
                            inventory which we could induce them to turn over <pb n="23"
                                xml:id="pg_23" facs="0053"/>on the assurance of his clients that it
                            would be repaid in money or in kind when the business became
                            established. He raised the question of money and indicated several legal
                            impedimenta which made it very difficult for his clients to put up any
                            money in advance. He asked whether we would advance the money upon the
                            assurance of his clients that it would be repaid. We told him we would
                            not cross that bridge until it was the only one left, and pointed out
                            that there were other possible clients who might go into a syndicate
                            with his clients. He said he knew of one such group which already had
                            enough money to provide the cash working capital if the inventory could
                            be acquired on credit as above and asked whether we were in a position
                            to bring this syndicate together with his clients. We told him we
                            thought his clients were in a better position to do this.</item>

                        AND J</p>
                    <p>I showed the draft of the cable we proposed to send and, with the deletion of
                        the reference to DYMAROON, the cable was approved, after explanations on my
                        part as to the identity of the pseudonyms and as to what we had been doing
                        with KMEGGCUP in the field of psychological warfare. The second M spoke very
                        highly of the effectiveness of this <gloss target="#t_PW1">P.W.</gloss> work
                        which he said had been handled quite largely from the country to the North.
                        He felt that these activities might well be stepped up.</p>
                    <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0054"/>
                    <p>I then referred to the three questions which had been put to the second M and
                        which BS later had put to B. There was general agreement as to the desired
                        result. The only question was whether we could play any part in achieving it
                        without alerting anyone as to the source of possible aid. I said that the
                        purpose of the cable was to remove any local people from any direct or
                        indirect contact with the activities. I also said we were calling back an
                        undercover contact man we had in the country to the South. He might return
                        but we would decide that after a conference.</p>
                    <p>In reply to any inquiry I said that no cash had been made available and that
                        I had some doubt as to whether this was needed in view of the intervention
                        of certain rich parties, whom I identified. However, it was possible that we
                        might lead <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Calligeris</persName>’ men or cutouts
                        to certain hardware which was available. All activities, with respect to the
                        hardware, would be restricted as far as we were concerned to this country
                        and handled through cutouts.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out that whatever happened in the country in question, people up
                        here would be blamed and that the important thing was that the operation
                        should be successful, if there was to be one. On this point I said that most
                        of the experts seemed to feel that this was most likely. I recognize that
                        for every hundred rumors of this nature, only one materialized; in this
                        case, however, it looked as though something were likely to happen.</p>
                    <p>I emphasized that we realized the very sensitive nature of this activity and
                        that it would be handled with the utmost care.</p>
                    <p>The first M then referred to the activities of a certain Col.
                            <persName>Mara</persName>, his relations with S, and how he had flown to
                        N with S and had apparently come back with a report on the situation in the
                        country of our interest, which was in the hands of the Boss.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d14fn2">See <ref target="#d11">Document 11</ref>. No record was
                            found of <persName>Mara</persName>’s trip to Nicaragua with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGA1">Somoza</persName>.</note> Whether this was
                        prepared by the good Colonel or by S was not known. All this had come about
                        after S had boasted at a luncheon with the Boss that with 600 pieces of
                        hardware he would “knock off” A. Among others who were present and who knew
                        all about this was S’s man here in Washington. I suggested that this again
                        was evidence that if anything happened, there would be plenty of other
                        persons to blame for it.</p>

                    <p>On September 26, 1952, Nicaraguan Ambassador <persName>Guillermo Sevilla
                            Sacasa</persName> and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for
                        Inter-American Affairs <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Thomas C. Mann</persName>
                        discussed briefly Nicaragua’s plans for organizing a group of Central
                        American states to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> invited the Ambassador to
                        return a few days later to discuss the matter in more detail.</p>
                    <p>They met again on September 29. Assuring the Ambassador that he was speaking
                        officially, <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> said that the United
                        States thought it unwise to talk about such a “military adventure.” He
                        explained: “The United States has subscribed to principles in the UN and the
                        OAS which are inconsistent with military adventures of this kind, and we
                        would find it difficult to fight aggression in Korea and be a party to it in
                        this hemisphere.… Furthermore, the proposal was, as a practical matter,
                        reckless since it would not be possible to maintain secrecy as is
                        illustrated by the fact that the Department already has received vague press
                        inquiries concerning the plan.” The full text of the September 29 memorandum
                        of conversation, including a reference to the September 26 conversation, is

                        raised at the UN General Assembly session scheduled to open on October 4.
                        The memorandum noted: “President <persName corresp="#p_SGA1"
                            >Somoza</persName> of Nicaragua apparently has gained the impression,
                        however mistakenly, that a military venture directed at the overthrow of the
                        present Guatemalan Government would have the blessing of the United States.”
                        The Ambassador of the Dominican Republic reported that <persName

                    <p>A meeting was held in the Director’s office. Those present: the Director, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAARA1">Dulles</persName>, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HS1">Hedden</persName>, Mr. [<hi rend="italic">name not

                        State. The Director was dissatisfied with the inconclusive position taken by
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEGJ1">Miller</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>. He telephoned to make an appointment
                        to discuss Project A with Under Secretary of State <persName
                            corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>.</p>

                    <p>A meeting was held in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HS1">Hedden</persName>’s
                        office. Those present: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HS1">Hedden</persName>, Mr.

                            >name not declassified</hi>]. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HS1"
                            >Hedden</persName> stated that authority to furnish matériel was
                        given.</p>

                    <p>A meeting was held in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAARA1">Dulles</persName>’
                        office. Those present: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAARA1">Dulles</persName>,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HS1">Hedden</persName>, and Mr. [<hi rend="italic"
                            >name not declassified</hi>]. Conversation seemed to be carried on on
                        the assumption that action was being taken. Mr. [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] specifically asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAARA1"
                            >Dulles</persName> whether we had the “green light” and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAARA1">Dulles</persName> replied affirmatively, stating
                        that [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] had been told that they could have the matériel if
                        and when they would indicate where they wished to pick it up. (At this or at
                        a previous conference, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAARA1">Dulles</persName>
                        mentioned that the Director had had conversations with Under Secretary of
                        State <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>.)</p>

                    <p>A meeting was held in the Director’s office. Those present: The Director,
                        Admiral <persName>Sauer</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAARA1"
                            >Dulles</persName> and [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>].
                        The Director called [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] and
                        instructed him to make recommendations as to future action. He requested
                        that a memorandum be prepared and presented to him. On 19 August the
                        memorandum was prepared for the signature of <persName corresp="#p_KCJC1"
                            >Colonel King</persName>, was discussed with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAARA1">Dulles</persName> by <persName corresp="#p_KCJC1"
                            >Colonel King</persName>, and forwarded to the Director. It was approved
                        by the Director on 9 September.</p>

                                >FGW</persName> on behalf of the Director stated that it had been
                            the understanding of the Agency that the State Department had approved
                            of the Agency’s project to provide certain hardware to a group planning
                            violence against a certain government; that some question had apparently
                            arisen as to whether State does approve; that the fact of the Agency’s
                            not having kept the Department informed of the developments in the
                            project was not considered by the Agency to be any reason for doubting
                            that the Department still approved because it had been understood that
                            the Department did not wish to be kept informed of the detailed plans.
                            In the Director’s view, the Agency is purely an executive organization
                            of the Government which carries out missions and conducts activities in
                            support of the foreign policy objectives of the Government. The State
                            Department has the primary responsibility in the field of foreign policy
                                <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0064"/>and accordingly, the Agency
                            would do nothing that is considered by the State Department to be
                            contrary to its policy determinations. If the State Department
                            disapproves of this particular project, the Agency will take immediate
                            steps to bring to a halt its participation in all phases of the matter
                            deemed objectionable by the State Department.</item>

                        <item>In a discussion regarding the basis for the Agency’s having understood
                            that the Department approved the project, <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1"
                                >FGW</persName> referred to the Agency’s records of conversations

                            in which he had said that he felt the risk of providing arms was too
                            great but that he had no objection to monetary contributions. He
                            recalled that he had also stated that a large American company must be
                            protected almost as strongly as the United States Government because
                            South Americans do not make any distinction between the two in their
                            political thinking and because trouble for the company involves the
                            Department in getting it out of trouble. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1"
                                >FGW</persName> stated that <persName corresp="#p_DAARA1"
                                >AD</persName> had told [<hi rend="italic">initials not

                            the green light to go ahead on the project but in the absence of
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAARA1">AD</persName> he did not know what was
                            the basis of this statement. <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">DB</persName>
                            stated that although he had some telephone conversations with the
                            Director he did not recall having said anything that could be
                            interpreted as approval.</item>

                        <item>Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">DB</persName>,
                                <persName>HFM</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_MEGJ1"
                                >EGM</persName> pointed to the remarks of General S to the effect
                            that he had the approval of the United States Government to go ahead
                            with a plan. <persName corresp="#p_KCJC1">JCK</persName> and [<hi
                                rend="italic">initials not declassified</hi>] gave assurances that
                            General S had gotten no such approval from representatives of the
                            Agency, and it was agreed that General S’s statements could be based
                            only upon remarks made to him by members of the White House staff. The
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> officials pointed out that large
                            quantities of arms have been acquired by the target government and other
                            leftist groups in the Caribbean; that a revolutionary movement against
                            the target is likely whether we support it or not, and that if it fails,
                            American policy will be seriously prejudiced. The State Department
                            officials made clear their feeling that if anything occurred there must
                            be no question of any part of the American Government having had a hand
                            in it, and they were not convinced that the plan for supplying the arms,
                            insofar as they know the details, could be carried out without a breach
                            of security.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>In conclusion <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">DB</persName> stated that
                            the Department approves of many of the activities which the Agency is
                            carrying out throughout the world and does not like to be called
                            obstructionist, but in the present case, as it has been called upon to
                            approve an export permit, it is forced to state <pb n="35"
                                xml:id="pg_35" facs="0065"/>that it disapproves of the entire deal.
                            He stated that the Department can raise no objection to any monetary
                            contribution which the Agency might make as it knows that the Agency is
                            constantly passing money for purposes which the Department could not
                            approve of and must do this in order to operate, but it feels that money
                            can be passed securely. The State Department officials present, however,
                            expressed their surprise that [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] should be again mixing up in a
                            Central American revolution and cautioned against using it as a
                            go-between.</item>

                        <item>K informed the group that as a result of a policy decision by State
                            yesterday opposing the shipment of machinery as planned, this decision
                            being precipitated by indiscretions of <persName corresp="#p_SGA1"
                                >Somoza</persName>, all of the action planned in support of the
                            opposition was off. K explained that <persName>Tachito Somoza</persName>
                            had indiscreetly approached Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_MEGJ1">Miller</persName> in Panama and asked him where
                            was the machinery, and both the Nicaraguan and Dominican Ambassadors had
                            called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> at the
                            Department of State to discuss the same matter. This confirmed our
                            general belief that no Latin American can be trusted to keep his mouth
                            shut. [<hi rend="italic">initials not declassified</hi>] raised the
                            question of the feeding of the men who are already mobilized, and
                            pointed out that even though no further action is taken, <gloss
                                target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> must have money to liquidate his
                            forces if he is not completely to lose face; that approximately $3,000
                            per week <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0066"/>are <gloss
                                target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss>’ present requirements. The
                            possibility was discussed of using the ship arriving in New Orleans on
                            Monday for shipment of machinery to our own place. [<hi rend="italic"
                                >initials not declassified</hi>] said this could be done without
                            difficulty if there were no trouble in getting the machinery on board.
                            He was sure he could re-route his ship and have it go direct to our own
                            place.</item>

                            Director. Present were the Director, [<hi rend="italic">initials not
                                declassified</hi>], and K.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The Director explained to [<hi rend="italic">initials not
                                declassified</hi>] that all plans for action were canceled. [<hi
                                rend="italic">initials not declassified</hi>] then pointed out the
                            responsibilities we have towards the people who are already in the field
                            and who have committed themselves, and the dangers to the entire
                            Caribbean area of the decision reached yesterday. The Director replied
                            that he was fully aware of the dangers inherent in such a decision, but
                            that this Agency is merely an executive agency to carry out the policies
                            of the Department of State and the Department of Defense, and if they
                            instruct us not to engage in a certain operation, we shall not engage in
                            that operation. [<hi rend="italic">initials not declassified</hi>] then
                            commented that the Department of State might very well change its
                            position in the near future because of the explosive situation in the
                            Caribbean. To this the Director agreed. K then stated that there had
                            been developments since FW’s report last evening to the Director, and
                            that it appeared we had <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0067"/>received
                            all the necessary clearances for the shipment of machinery from New
                            Orleans in spite of the questions raised yesterday by State. K stated
                            that he was not even suggesting action in violation of the position
                            taken by State yesterday, but that this shipment could go out as planned
                            except that it would be to a new consignee and to a secure place under
                            our absolute control [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                                not declassified</hi>]. The General asked what place did K have in
                            mind—was it our own? When the answer was in the affirmative, the
                            Director telephoned <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">DB</persName><note

                            shipping the machinery to the country for which it was originally
                            destined, apparently we had all the necessary clearances and would ship
                            it to a place of our own [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source

                                >DB</persName> expressed himself as surprised that we had such
                            clearances, apparently no objection was interposed. The Director
                            authorized K to proceed with this shipment to our place if it could be
                            securely arranged and if it were true that necessary authorizations did
                            exist.</item>

                        <item>K and [<hi rend="italic">initials not declassified</hi>] described the
                            situation of <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss>, with a number of
                            men already mobilized, and the need of supplying <gloss

                            action if we were not to be even more embarrassed with our Central
                            American friends. The Director asked how much was needed. K replied
                            $3,000 a week. The Director said he would go along for four weeks and
                            would approve $15,000.</item>

                                appears to collaborate with the Communists and extremists to the

                                that he personally does not agree with the economic and political
                                ideas of the Guatemalan or Soviet Communists, and I am equally
                                certain that he is not now in a position where they can force him to
                                make decisions in their favor. The reasons for my opinion are as

                                >Arbenz</persName> desires to establish a “modern democracy” which
                            would improve the lot of its people through paternalistic social
                            reforms. <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>’ personal idol is
                            FDR and his reforms are patterned after New Deal reforms and adjusted to
                            the backward economy and social structure of Guatemala. None of the
                            reforms is substantially extreme as compared to many of those in the US,
                            Europe, and even in other Latin American countries. The <pb n="40"
                                xml:id="pg_40" facs="0070"/>extremities are relative and seem
                            radical in Guatemala only because of the backward feudal situation they
                            are meant to remedy. Also they seem extreme compared to the ineffective
                            piecemeal measures of his predecessor, <persName>Arevalo</persName>.
                            During <persName>Arevalo</persName>’s term, <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1"
                                >Arbenz</persName> often became angry at his weakness as a
                            chief-of-state and realized that no effective social measures could be
                            implemented while <persName>Arevalo</persName> was president. Satisfying
                            his ambition to become president himself, and also with a sincere desire

                                >Arbenz</persName> went to work immediately and impatiently to
                            implement his reforms and, as he put it, “to jar Guatemala out of the

                                    power he feared a popular revolt more than anything else. He
                                    pictured himself as FDR in 1932 and followed what he thought was
                                    a similar course, that is, he achieved popular support by
                                    relieving some of the immediate economic and social pressure on
                                    the very poor at the expense of the very rich. The reactionary
                                    group, in which <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>
                                    had many personal friends, fully expected him to reverse his
                                    field once his presidency was assured and forget his reform
                                    promises. When it became evident that he was serious about
                                    reform, the landowners became quite bitter and opposed him at
                                    every turn. The reactionaries immediately turned the Communist
                                    spotlight on all reform measures regardless of merit.</item>

                                    Communism a ready-made tool with which he could organize the

                                    emotional appeal to the people was a platform that was anti-US
                                    and defiant of US corporate imperialism. Meanwhile the Communist

                                    husband and expresses these ideas at will. This lady was
                                    educated in the US and was raised and spoiled in the luxurious
                                    style of wealthy inbred aristocrats. Her socialistic, left-wing
                                    ideas are, in my opinion, a definite reaction to this
                                    background. So far the President has not appeared to have been
                                    influenced by his wife’s ideas. One exception to this is the
                                    case of relations with El Salvador. These have been and will

                        <item><persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> realizes that Guatemala
                            is economically dependent on the US but intends to bluff through his
                            defiance of US corporations to any length short of national suicide. An
                            integral part of his program is the removal of Guatemala from the
                            category of a “subsidiary of United Fruit”. He is a stubborn idealist
                            who is willing to risk his own wealth and who is able to enlist the
                            support of others to risk their wealth on the gamble of getting national
                            control of Guatemala’s fruit, coffee and chicle industries and its
                            mineral and petroleum potential. Sacrifices are to be expected under

                            willing to make them. He feels that any hardships on his people
                            resulting from defiance of US imperialism would be politically offset by
                            its nationalistic appeal so as not to effect the perpetuity of the

                        <item>His goal is to assert the rights of the Guatemalan Government to

                            concerned. Knowing that his country will never be a large industrial
                            nation and yet needing a sound economy to carry out his reform programs,

                            is expanding production and keeping a larger share of what is produced.
                            Yet he realizes this is not possible without US markets and US capital.
                            He realizes that if prices fell in the US or if US import restrictions
                            barred Guatemala’s goods, his country would go bankrupt. <persName

                            happen. He can only bluff because he has no place to turn. The one
                            possibility would be the Soviet bloc, which might conceivably finance
                            the country in order to maintain a western hemisphere subversion base.
                            This is the one thing <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> does
                            not want. He definitely would prefer US domination to Soviet domination.
                            The best example of this is the fact that throughout his <pb n="42"
                                xml:id="pg_42" facs="0072"/>bluffing of US interests he has never
                            used the potential weapon of proposed trade treaties with Soviet bloc
                            countries, although it seems logical to assume that such commercial
                            overtures have been made to him. It is my belief that <persName

                            the US. He may, however, bluff too long for the good of his

                            for several years told me that if the price of coffee dropped five cents
                            he would get out of Guatemala immediately. The price of coffee is high
                            but the government depends on it to offset some of the losses of the
                            other branches of the economy. Aviateca is bankrupt, several public
                            works projects are in the red, there is trouble in the mining industry
                            and Wrigley stopped buying chicle in the Peten. Despite these reverses,
                            if the price of coffee holds up the regime will stand financially and
                            still carry out most of its social reforms. Yet most of the growers feel
                            that it will take five more years of today’s high prices to reach a
                            point where they can withstand a substantial drop in coffee prices. Once
                            the price goes down, only the large growers will be able to hold their
                            land. These will also be able to buy up other lands merely to keep them
                            idle in an attempt to cut down the supply until the prices rise. These
                            tactics would centralize the wealth and starve the workers. These
                            deserted fincas would become overgrown immediately in this climate and
                            if a finca is idle just one year it takes at least five years to put one
                            back into production. In such a situation it would be impossible for the
                            present regime to stay in power.</item>

                            for his right to dictate terms for oil exploitation. The government owns
                            most of the oil lands outright and also owns the rights to all
                            underground minerals as only surface rights are included in private

                            from reactionary groups. When I left Guatemala two weeks ago the
                            President’s wife and three children had flown to Washington and from
                            there to Switzerland where the children will be put in school. Someone
                            asked the President if this household evacuation indicated that he
                            anticipated any trouble. He denied it emphatically, stating the family
                            had planned the move some time ago (<persName corresp="#p_AGJ1"
                                >Arbenz</persName>’ father was a Swiss immigrant). There is little
                            real worry around <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> about an
                            anti-Communist or reactionary coup. <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1"
                                >Arbenz</persName> and <persName>Fanjul</persName> both feel that
                            there are just not enough large landholders who are interested in or
                            capable of accomplishing a coup and that they could not line up the
                            other dissident elements. The President has several very close friends
                            in the reactionary ranks, all of whom are wealthy and would have less
                            personal gain from <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>’

                            left-wing government officials. I believe the President is better
                            informed on activities in the rightist opposition camp than within his
                            leftist support groups.</item>

                            friendly terms with him. The Communist-inspired agrarian reform bill
                            which was to have met with fierce opposition from all conservative
                            elements has actually been received with surprising calm by business
                            interests and a great part of the landowners. One reason for the
                            relaxing of their fears is the retention of the “last word” power by the
                            President and by the appointment of his private secretary as
                            administrator.</item>

                            to rest with himself. This relieved the business interests and
                            landholders as it was an indication of a “realistic” approach to land
                            reform. There is confidence that the President himself would veto any

                            the President’s act definitely was unconstitutional. When I advised him

                            of food to take the chances involved in clearing and planting

                            there are 35 families living there permanently. During coffee harvest
                            about 80 more workers are recruited in the hills. These hill people are
                            more or less independent but all envy the life of the workers on our
                            finca, for whom we provide shelter and a year-round source of food. The

                            may already have been, approached by the Communist organization in

                            department charged with administering the new land reform law. He is a
                            fat, jovial, extrovert who has succeeded in gaining the complete
                            confidence of <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> and who has
                            acted as the President’s personal secretary. It was the President’s
                            desire for direct personal supervision that prompted him to appoint
                                <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Martinez</persName> to head this
                            important department rather than a tendency to repudiate the known

                                MacDonald</persName>. This appointment was viewed with relief by the
                            business and coffee growing interests. This view is correct as long as
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> is President, but the
                            reform machinery has now been set up and with someone else as president
                            who is of more leftist orientation or under actual Communist control,
                            the situation would be radically different. <persName corresp="#p_MMA1"
                                >Martinez</persName>’ recent, though nominal, promotion, his

                        conversation but I feel that it should be rewritten for the purpose of
                        sterilization and that all copies of the existing memorandum should be
                        burned as too revealing. Further concerning Mr. [<hi rend="italic">name not

                        the language of the last sentence on page 1. Instead of saying that “the

                        out the orders of the State Department ….”, I think it would be much better
                        to express these thoughts as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                nothing that is considered by the State Department to be contrary to
                                its policy determinations. If the State Department disapproves of
                                this particular project, the Agency will take immediate steps to
                                bring to a halt its participation in all phases of the matter deemed
                                objectionable by the State Department.”</p></quote></p>

                            <persName>Mora</persName>, in Managua, talked rather openly of the
                        attempt on Guatemala to be made with Nicaraguan and U.S. backing.</p>
                    <p>When <persName>Whelan</persName> came to the U.S., he was told by <persName

                        interested in sponsoring a “covert” aggression on any American State, to
                        call his attention to mutual obligations of the two countries under the OAS
                        and UN, and to state that any request for U.S. arms should be made through
                        normal diplomatic channels. However, <persName corresp="#p_MEGJ1"
                            >Miller</persName> indicated to <persName>Whelan</persName> that he
                        thought some support for <persName corresp="#p_SGA1">Somoza</persName> might

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SGA1">Somoza</persName> has said that he has an
                        alliance with the Dominican Republic, Panama and Venezuela, but
                            <persName>Welch</persName> doubts it. The Dominican Ambassador is away

                        believes that <persName corresp="#p_SGA1">Somoza</persName> is relying on

                        However, <persName>Welch</persName> says that when the Nicaraguan press
                        indicated last month that the U.S. was supporting <persName
                            corresp="#p_SGA1">Somoza</persName>, and at the same time announced that
                        a revolution was about to take place in Guatemala, all the countries
                        mentioned plus Haiti, Colombia, and Cuba, appeared anxious to get into the
                        act, or at least it seemed so to one in Managua at the time.</p>
                    <p><persName>Welch</persName> feels that <persName corresp="#p_SGA1"
                            >Somoza</persName> would aid any attempt on Guatemala only to the extent
                        that he was benefiting more than he was aiding. He might provide a training
                        area and obsolete arms in exchange for new arms. <persName>Welch</persName>
                        feels that <persName corresp="#p_SGA1">Somoza</persName> is much more
                        concerned with <persName>Jose Figueres</persName>’ possible election to the

                            >Somoza</persName> will move against <persName>Figueres</persName>

                                Job 79–01025A, Box 134, Folder 6. Top Secret. A cover memorandum,
                                not printed, indicates that the report is a record of a conference
                                held November 27–December 1; the participants’ names and the
                                location of the conference were not declassified.</p>
                            <p>Also on December 1 Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_ADG1"
                                    >Acheson</persName> met with Guatemalan Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TGG1">Guillermo Toriello</persName> to discuss
                                U.S.-Guatemalan relations, especially pro-Communist propaganda and
                                activities in the Guatemalan Congress. Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TGG1">Toriello</persName> attempted to justify
                                Guatemala’s attitude toward Communist influence in the country.
                                “Once or twice during the conversation, <persName corresp="#p_TGG1"
                                    >Toriello</persName> urged us not to be taken in by the
                                denunciations of the Government by the opposition. By innuendo, he
                                seemed to allege that our estimate of the situation had been unduly
                                influenced by wild stories and rumors circulated by the subversive
                                opposition, disguised and cloaked by anti-communism. The
                                anti-communist movement in Guatemala is dangerous, he argued, since
                                it does conveniently serve as a cloak for the irreconcilable
                                opposition.” The full text of the memorandum of conversation is

                                <item>The Guatemalan government has, during the last few weeks,
                                    shifted three or four of its garrison commanders. This of course
                                    is one measure taken to prevent anti-government forces from
                                    becoming established in the army. In two instances this shifting
                                    of commanders has worked against us and we have been obliged to
                                    select new leaders within the garrisons concerned. We anticipate
                                    further moves of this nature and expect to counteract it by
                                    having at least two of the superior officers in our
                                    organization.</item>

                                <item><p>Recently, we learned of the government’s plan to make
                                        Quetzaltenango its headquarters in the event of revolution.
                                        The government expects any invasion to start from across the
                                        Salvadoran frontier and believes its best chances for
                                        defense are to fall back on Quetzaltenango and establish a
                                        defensive line roughly north and south through that city.
                                        Terrain favors such a defense and, by so doing, the
                                        government will have in its rear, i.e. the area between
                                        Quetzaltenango and the Mexican frontier, the wealthiest and
                                        most productive section of Guatemala from which to draw
                                        support. The government recently transferred one of its best
                                        officers to command Quetzaltenango and has re-enforced the
                                        area with troops and arms. Fortunately at the same time the
                                        government transferred to the garrison as [<hi rend="italic"

                                        in command one of our best officers. Thus, as long as he is
                                        there we will be fully informed on all government plans for
                                        the area. In this instance shifting of commanders has worked
                                        in our favor.</p>

                                    deputies to the National Congress are to be elected. Though the

                                    come up for re-appointment. The deputies elected in January take
                                    office on 1 March and they will make the appointments to the
                                    courts. These appointments will carry down to the city
                                    magistrate level. Thus if the communists completely dominate the

                                    January, and I assure you they will, they will in turn appoint
                                    their own men to the courts and will, by 15 March, completely
                                    dominate the three branches of the government, i.e., Executive,

                    <p>We have been building our organization before March of this year. We counted
                        heavily upon your help. Unfortunately that help has now been withdrawn. We
                        used that promise of help as a restraint upon our people from impatient
                        action. Now we can restrain them no longer. Secondly, the Guatemalan
                        government is now proceeding on a plan of action which, if successful, will
                        give that government complete domination of every phase of Guatemalan life.
                        If we permit the government to succeed in its present plan then our chances
                        of eventually overthrowing that government will be very considerably
                        reduced. It has therefore been the decision of the group controlling our
                        organization to strike not later than the first of February 1953 with
                        whatever means we have at our disposal.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Foreword</p>
                    <p>This paper is one of thirty evaluations of the capabilities of Communist
                        Parties in the countries of the free world. It is divided into two parts:
                        (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics‘ and capabilities of the party;
                        and (2) a compilation of the specific “assets” of the party drawn up on the
                        basis of an exhaustive checklist provided by the Central Intelligence
                        Agency.</p>
                    <p>The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current major objectives of
                        the party; the specific tactics employed to carry them out; and the
                        capability of the party to achieve its objectives assessed in the light of
                        both past and present performance.</p>
                    <p>The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the evaluative
                        portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational potential and
                        material assets of the party and, at the same time, providing an index to
                        areas of Communist activity where information is inadequate, unreliable, or
                        absent. The data presented in the section on “Assets” should not be treated
                        as definitive; they are rather the best available to the Department at the
                        present time.</p>

                        Capabilities</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">I. Objectives</hi></p>
                    <p>The immediate objectives of the Communist Party of Guatemala, now the
                        Guatemalan Labor Party (Partido Guatemalteco de Trabajo, PGT), are to extend
                        the party’s control over labor, to increase its influence in and
                        infiltration of the leftist-nationalist government, and to dominate the more
                        radical intellectual circles of the country. The Communists push
                        “progressive” Guatemalan political groups toward extreme labor, agrarian,
                        and educational reform, intensify nationalist dissatisfaction with US
                        private interests in Guatemala, and portray US foreign policy as the
                        instrument of “imperialistic warmongers”.</p>
                    <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0087"/>
                    <p>Communist objectives during the comparatively short period of three years of
                        open existence have remained constant. Such alterations and diversions as
                        have occurred were essentially related to the will of an administration
                        which, in the final analysis, has the real power to determine the Communist
                        Party’s life or death. Thus, with government support, Communists played a
                        key role in whipping up and organizing popular feeling against the United
                        Fruit Company during the Company–labor disputes of 1951. Subsequently,
                        however, Communist labor leaders silently accepted a government rejection of
                        radical labor code revision. And presently, Communist propagandists in key
                        positions have sharply reduced their attacks upon the United States,
                        apparently because the Guatemalan Government does not wish to prejudice
                        negotiations for assistance from the United States.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">II. Tactics</hi></p>
                    <p>Among groups in Guatemalan society to which the Communists especially direct
                        themselves are urban and rural labor. Intellectuals and the “progressive
                        bourgeoisie” are also high on the list of targets, although the appeal to
                        the latter is mixed with distrust and is, in part, inspired by reason of
                        political necessity because of the middle class core of the national
                        revolutionary movement which has inspired Guatemalan political life since
                        1944. Since they are few in numbers the Communists concentrate upon
                        infiltrating and capturing existing organizational leadership, or, they may
                        bring into existence their own front organization, especially with respect
                        to peace, youth, and women’s groups.</p>
                    <p>The Communists, with the assistance of the government, have successfully
                        directed the unification of labor and have joined the national General
                        Confederation of Workers of Guatemala (Confederación General de Trabajadores
                        de Guatemala, CGTG) with the regional Communist Confederation of Workers of
                        Latin America (Confederación de Trabajadores de América Latina, <gloss
                            target="#t_CTAL1">CTAL</gloss>) and the international Communist World
                        Federation of Trade Unions (<gloss target="#t_WFTU1">WFTU</gloss>). The
                        Communists now seek to expand their control over labor by ousting
                        non-Communist leadership from important railway and rural unions, but
                        especially by leading the government-supported agrarian reform program from
                        which they may expect to realize thousands of recruits among the unorganized
                        peasantry. Thus, the Communists can hope to extend their influence among the
                        electorate and, therefore, over the government by control of voters and by
                        their ability to organize mob demonstrations, while at the same time they
                        strengthen Communist international labor organizations and a variety of
                        front groups.</p>
                    <p>Among the intellectuals the Communists have successfully concentrated their
                        attention upon educators and writers. They and their sympathizers control
                        the principal teachers’ union and the most vigorous professional <pb n="58"
                            xml:id="pg_58" facs="0088"/>artists’ and writers’ union, and have
                        strongly penetrated the official and semi-official press and the government
                        propaganda agencies. From these positions they may hope more effectively to
                        accelerate the government’s leftist and nationalist programs, while they
                        cover the nation with propaganda in line with Soviet objectives.</p>
                    <p>The political tactics of the Communists are adjusted to international
                        Communist strategy and the local environment. From the time of its public
                        emergence in mid-1951 until very recently, the Communists, without legal
                        status, have encouraged and supported the dominant leftist government
                        parties and have sought to work through them, as well as through friends in
                        the executive branch of the government. The Communists have consistently
                        taken a proprietary interest in the activities of the government parties,
                        admonishing and criticizing in detail and urging a united “democratic front”
                        against “reaction”. Four admitted Communists have won seats in the national
                        legislature as candidates of the government parties. There also are probably
                        several crypto-Communists seated in this body of 58 delegates which, on the
                        whole, is either sympathetic toward or tolerant of Communism. Within the
                        legislature the Communists successfully work for assignment to labor and
                        agrarian committees and will be found in the vanguard of legislative support
                        for nationalistic measures. This is in addition to the promotion of more
                        direct Soviet objectives as represented, for example, by the “Korean
                        solidarity” manifesto signed by 19 members of Congress in June 1952. The
                        recent registration of the Communist Party as the Guatemalan Labor Party
                        (PGT) now gives this group legal status for the first time. The maneuver in
                        all probability does not, however, indicate alteration of Communist
                        political tactics.</p>
                    <p>In the executive they also seek out positions which best enable them to
                        promote their program. Thus, they have heavily infiltrated the Social
                        Security System, the Agrarian Department and the propaganda agencies. It is
                        apparent also that <persName corresp="#p_FJM1">Fortuny</persName>, PGT’s
                        General Secretary, has access to the inner circle of politicians who
                        surround the President. He is credited with drafting the recently passed
                        Agrarian Reform Law which subsequently was steered through Congress under
                        Communist leadership.</p>

                    <p>Communist success in Guatemala is strongly conditioned by the superficially
                        democratic, leftist, and nationalistic environment brought about by the
                        Revolution of 1944. The social and economic backwardness of the country and
                        the powerful role played by US business interest in the Guatemalan life
                        provide the Communists with obvious ammunition. Nor is there any question
                        about the relatively high efficiency of Communist leadership in Guatemala.
                        So far, it has demonstrated an ability to lead groups heretofore outside of
                        the nation’s political life, as well as strongly to influence politicians
                        who either cannot comprehend <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0089"/>or who
                        refuse to comprehend the significance of the tie between local and
                        international Communism. Finally, the traditional ruling groups in
                        Guatemala, particularly the landholders, are so demoralized and divided,
                        that they have been unable to offer serious opposition to Communist
                        development.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, there are serious limitations to the Communist position.
                        Although the Communists have enjoyed considerable success in capturing key
                        positions among important groups in Guatemalan society, they have not yet
                        gained a substantial consistent popular following. They must continually
                        contend with an essentially inarticulate and conservative mass. On higher
                        levels they must face the fact that the economic groups which subscribe to
                        the principles of the Revolution of 1944 are not extremists and that many
                        seeming pro-Communist political allies are, in fact, primarily
                        opportunists.</p>
                    <p>The real answer to Communist success in Guatemala lies with the attitude of
                        the administrations of <persName>Juan José Arévalo</persName> (1945–1951)
                        and <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Jacobo Arbenz</persName> (1951– ), for,
                        despite democratic overtones, Guatemalan political life is still largely run
                        by the executive. <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>, in
                        particular, has favored Communist development because he has found its
                        leadership cooperative and capable. Whether or not he fully appreciates the
                        dangers of Communism, he apparently believes that he controls the Communist
                        organization. He has the power to check or break the Communist organization
                        at will. In the last analysis the Communists are dependent upon the
                        executive’s pleasure for their positions and probably the great bulk of
                        their financial support. In themselves they lack the economic resources and
                        popular following to contest determined opposition from the President.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">I. Numerical Strength</hi></p>
                    <p>There are probably less than 1,000 members of the Guatemalan Labor Party
                        (Partido Guatemalteco de Trabajo, PGT). PGT’s petition for registration in
                        December 1952 carried 532 signatures. Cell organization may be found in
                        predominantly rural areas, but Communist strength is centered in the
                        capital, Guatemala City. PGT membership is drawn from the middle class and
                        labor and its leadership has come largely from among intellectuals and
                        bureaucrats. On the whole, while there are opportunists and dilettantes in
                        PGT, its membership is militant and well-disciplined. Leaders such as
                            <persName corresp="#p_FJM1">José Manuel Fortuny</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_GVM1">Victor Manuel Gutiérrez</persName> are judged
                        particularly capable. Short of engaging in violence against heavy odds,
                        considerable personal sacrifice may be expected from members of this small
                        group as long as they have backing within the government.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">II. Electoral Strength</hi></p>
                    <p>Until the registration of PGT (December 1952) Communist Party members gained
                        a limited number of elected positions—primarily in the National Congress—as
                        candidates sponsored by the dominant government parties. In addition, some
                        crypto-Communists have attained office as members of the progovernment
                        parties. The present strategy of the newly registered PGT is continued
                        reliance upon the “democratic front” support of other parties to provide
                        electoral success. There are four acknowledged Communists presently in
                        Congress. PGT can probably poll its largest vote in Guatemala City, but
                        there it also faces the strongest opposition. In the mayoralty contests of
                        1951, the independent candidate in Guatemala City, with unusually
                        well-unified, anti-Communist support, won over the progovernment and
                        Communist-backed candidate by 5,000 votes (24,000–19,000). In the most
                        recent congressional election (January 1953), <persName corresp="#p_FJM1"
                            >Fortuny</persName>, Secretary General of PGT, was defeated as the
                        progovernment candidate in the capital, while another coalition-sponsored
                        Communist was winning in an outlying province. Independent Communist
                        electoral strength in rural areas probably is not great.</p>

                            for Violent Action</hi></p>
                    <p>As an ally of a friendly government, PGT has had little cause to organize and
                        plan for violent insurrection and no such plans are known to exist. PGT has
                        threatened violence against the government’s opposition for alleged
                        revolutionary plots, however, and there have been some reports of
                        Communist-controlled unions possessing firearms. Communist resort to force
                        has been confined largely to rural areas where they have had some success in
                        promoting mob intimidation of local landowners. Should the Communists have
                        to face official opposition, it is doubtful that they could rally more than
                        a few hundred willing to risk violence.</p>

                    <p>Communist freedom of action is essentially geared to the will of the present
                        administration which has the capabilities, but not the inclination, to wipe
                        out the small Communist organization. The Communists, in fact, receive from
                        the government strategic political appointments and benefit from propaganda
                        and indirect financial assistance. PGT operations are favored by a leftist,
                        nationalist, and “democratic” climate, but the Party lacks a popular
                        following and must work with a generally nonpolitical, apathetic mass.</p>

                    <p>The rank and file of Guatemalan union members, who are centered in
                        plantations, farms, transport, communications, and small urban industrial
                            <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0091"/>enterprises, although susceptible
                        to demagogic leadership, are essentially non-Communist. Exceptions to this
                        may exist in professional unions, as in the case of the left-wing press
                        guild. At the same time, except for a few groups, such as the railway union,
                        the rank-and-file membership cannot be considered anti-Communist. It is
                        largely undisciplined and, especially in the rural areas, is likely to be
                        apathetic or conservative. Communist control of Guatemalan labor is centered
                        in the leadership of the General Confederation of Guatemalan Labor
                        (Confederación General de Trabajadores de Guatemala, CGTG), a <gloss

                        associate, to which the principal labor unions in the country belong. The
                        CGTG’s total claimed membership is 50,000. Possibly the largest union in the
                        CGTG, and one of the most consistently pro-Communist, is the teachers’ union
                        which has a claimed membership of 10,000. Certain unions in the CGTG, such
                        as the United Fruit Company and the Pan American Airways organizations, have
                        shown clear-cut Communist direction in recent labor disputes. Rural labor,
                        other than United Fruit Company workers and those on the national coffee
                        fincas, which are affiliated with the CGTG, is nominally controlled by the
                        National Farm Workers Confederation (Confederación Nacional de Campesinos de
                        Guatemala, CNCG), an associate of the CGTG, whose exaggerated claim of
                        200,000 members represents only a potential at best. CNCG apparently has
                        recently fallen more definitely under pro-Communist leadership. It is
                        currently engaged in exploiting the political advantages to be gained
                        through the implementation of the Agrarian Reform Law.</p>
                    <p>Local union leadership probably is less consistently in Communist hands. One
                        important United Fruit Company union, at least, has sharply vacillated
                        between Communists and opportunists. Anti-Communists or opportunists have
                        offered especially strong resistance to Communist infiltration in the
                        railway union which has a membership of 4,400 and which, by US standards,
                        most closely approximates a trade union.</p>

                    <p>Communist front groups are represented in the familiar realms of “peace”,
                        youth, women’s, and intellectual activities. Their activities center
                        primarily in Guatemala City. A tolerant, often sympathetic, government
                        provides not only protection, but also frequent official recognition,
                        favorable propaganda, and indirect financial assistance.</p>

                        associated with the leftist-nationalist Revolution of 1944. Communist
                        infiltration of this group has been heavy and its policies have been
                        strongly pro-Communist, including advocacy of the “peace” movement. The
                        organization publishes a locally well-known journal of the same name. Grupo
                        Saker-Ti probably receives Government financial assistance, a factor <pb

                        supported international meetings. Under present political circumstances,

                    <p>There are several small refugee groups in Guatemala, some of which may be
                        considered front organizations. One of these is the Spanish Republican
                        Center (Centro Republicano Español), which has, perhaps, 50 members.</p>

                            Government</hi></p>
                    <p>There are four known Communists, including the second ranking party member,
                            <persName corresp="#p_GVM1">Victor Manuel Gutiérrez</persName>, in the
                        National Congress which has 58 seats. The majority of the 43 members of the
                        dominant government <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0093"/>parties in
                        Congress are either pro-Communist or tolerant of PGT and there are probably
                        a number of crypto-Communists among them. PGT members control three
                        important congressional committees: labor, agrarian reform, and that dealing
                        with revision of public contracts, a factor of particular concern to US
                        companies operating in the country. Communists and their sympathizers
                        heavily infiltrate the executive. At the top, <persName corresp="#p_FJM1"
                            >José Manuel Fortuny</persName>, Secretary General of PGT, is believed
                        to be a member of the President’s inner circle of advisers. Communists are
                        strategically located in the Secretariat of Propaganda from which they
                        disseminate the Communist line through official and semiofficial press and
                        radio and through an extensive poster campaign. They occupy key positions
                        from top to bottom in the Social Security System. They not only were
                        instrumental in pushing through the Agrarian Reform program but now dominate
                        much of its present field administration, particularly at the lower levels
                        which afford direct contact with the landless peasantry and where
                        confiscatory cases are initiated. The national coffee fincas, now
                        administered by the Agrarian Department, have been major centers of
                        Communist-dominated labor organization in the rural areas.</p>
                    <p>There are possibly a few Communists at lower levels of the armed forces and
                        police. If the recent appeal to soldiers in terms of the Agrarian Reform
                        program is successful, the Communists will have improved leverage in this
                        direction. None are believed to be among the higher ranking officers, even
                        though these have been willing to go along with the government’s policy of
                        cooperation with the Communists.</p>

                    <p>Communists strongly influence public educational circles, especially through
                        their leadership in the teachers’ union and through their infiltration of
                        traveling cultural missions in the interior. They are, however, strongly
                        resisted in the University. As noted, the Communists have obtained strategic
                        positions from which they disseminate propaganda through press, radio, and
                        posters to large segments of the population. This is countered, to some
                        extent, by the fact that the largest newspaper circulation is in the hands
                        of the anti-Communist press. The Communists are actively resisted by the
                        Catholic Church insofar as its resources permit, but that institution is
                        relatively weak in Guatemala.</p>

                    <p>Forty-seven of 58 seats in the National Congress, including the four occupied
                        by known Communists, are held by government-backed political parties. Most
                        of these are either tolerant of, or sympathetic toward, PGT and a number are
                        probably crypto-Communists. The largest and most influential of the
                        progovernment parties is the Party of Revolutionary Action (Partido de
                        Accion Revolucionaria, PAR), which is also the most pro-Communist. <pb
                            n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0094"/>These parties have invited the
                        numerically weak PGT to participate in national electoral “democratic
                        fronts” and have successfully sponsored admitted Communist candidates.
                        Except in Guatemala City, opposition parties are badly split and are
                        handicapped by the government-controlled electoral machinery. As already
                        noted, of the two coalition-sponsored Communist candidates running in the
                        most recent congressional elections (January 1953), <persName

                        activity. Guatemala has also been a haven for small groups of political
                        exiles, some of whom have strong Communist leanings, from neighboring
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Many Guatemalans, Communists and fellow-travellers, have visited the Soviet
                        orbit, usually to attend international meetings. It is certain that the
                        Communists among these have been couriers for Soviet instructions. The best
                        example of this was the visit which <persName corresp="#p_GVM1"
                            >Gutiérrez</persName> made to Moscow in 1951. It probably was no
                        coincidence that his small Communist labor party was merged with the main
                        Communist group shortly after <persName corresp="#p_GVM1"
                            >Gutiérrez</persName>’ return to Guatemala. The most recent
                        demonstration of the sensitivity of the Guatemalan party to Moscow came with
                        the alteration of the party’ naame in December 1952 to the Guatemalan Labor
                        Party (PGT), a maneeuver traceable to the policies expressed th the
                        Ninteenth Soviet Congress of 1952.</p>

                        document’s conclusion in Paragraph 53 that “It is improbable that the
                        Communists will gain direct control over the policy of any Latin American
                        state, at least during the next several years”, an appreciation which, in my
                        opinion, may somewhat gloss over the Communist potential, at least in
                        Guatemala, for achieving results just as injurious to the security of the
                        United States by clever and effective concentration on influencing events by
                        indirect means as by concentration on achieving direct control of the
                        Government’s policy-making apparatus.</p>
                    <p>In Guatemala, our observation has been that the Communists have thus far
                        dedicated rather minor efforts towards obtaining control of the openly
                        established policy-making positions but have rather aimed at installing
                        their people in positions which will give leverage over influential groups
                        in order to achieve their aims. Thus they have achieved control of the
                        Executive Committee of the Confederación General de Trabajadores de
                        Guatemala (CGTG), the national labor federation; a large measure of
                        influence over the Confederación Nacional Campesina de Guatemala (CNCG), the
                        agricultural federation; leadership of the Sindicato de Trabajadores de
                        Educacion de Guatemala (STEG), the teachers’ union; key positions in the
                        Instituto Guatemalteco de Seguridad Social (IGSS), the wealthy Government
                        social security agency; close to a policy-making role in the official and
                        pro-Government press and radio; and substantial influence over the actions
                        of the major nationalist “revolutionary” parties on which the Administration
                        bases its organized political support. Additionally, in the current Congress
                        they chose the Special Committees on Agrarian <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68"
                            facs="0098"/>Reform and Labor Code Revision as the committees to
                        dominate and, principally through the CGTG and CNCG, are now attempting to
                        establish their ascendancy over the administrative machinery created to
                        carry out the Agrarian Reform Law of June 17, 1952. On the other hand, so
                        far as can be determined, the Communists have concentrated little or no
                        effort to obtain control of the Armed or Police Forces, the Foreign Office
                        or other such key policy-making bodies which would be along a shorter route
                        to gaining direct control over the policy of Guatemala.</p>
                    <p>This pattern of penetration, while it does reflect the probable Communist
                        realization that their domestic and foreign support is presently
                        insufficient to hope for the early establishment of a “People’s Democracy”
                        in Guatemala, is illuminating of the real Communist objective here. This is
                        clearly to so disrupt the country’s internal structure and foreign relations
                        that its integration into the common efforts of the Western world will be at
                        a minimum, particularly with respect to those efforts designed to safeguard
                        this community against eventual domination by the Soviet homeland of
                        Communism. The Communists themselves have said as much, for instance, in
                        defining the end of their local “Peace” campaign as assuring that
                        “imperialism” will not be able to exploit the country for its “war
                        preparations”. To achieve this aim, the Communists have used the leverage of
                        the organizations they have penetrated to mobilize a wide front which upsets
                        the tranquility of Guatemala’s relationship to the Western community. Thus
                        they have played up such measures as labor and social security legislation
                        and Agrarian Reform both as a means for capturing leadership of the
                        ill-defined desire for progress of liberal groups and, more importantly, as
                        a means of fomenting debilitating internal strife and dislocations. They
                        have also, however, exploited every tendency to nationalism and autarchy
                        which might serve to break down the ties and good relations of Guatemala
                        with the United States and its friends. (For instance, in the recent
                        Congressional campaign, Sr. <persName corresp="#p_FJM1">Jose Manuel
                            Fortuny</persName>, Secretary General of the Communist Partido
                        Guatemalteco de Trabajo, warmly endorsed the demand for higher tariffs of
                        the General Association of Industrialists, a manufacturers’ and
                        businessmen’s organization normally considered “reactionary” by the
                        Communists.) The exploitation of these dynamic and potentially anti-American
                        factors is the cardinal reason for the “Patriotic Front” which the
                        Communists announced as their tactic in their Party Congress last December
                        (my despatch No. 586, January 5, 1953).<note n="4" xml:id="d34fn4">Not
                            printed.</note></p>
                    <p>To view the situation here in perspective, then, it is necessary to consider
                        that the neutralizing of Guatemala as a Western nation is the <pb n="69"

                            word “immediate” is underlined and a handwritten note in the margin
                            reads: “no doubt in my mind that the Guat reds have a longer range

                            govt—evidenced by the drive to control the Agrarian Reform machinery and
                            its access to the masses. FW”</note> Communist objective and that
                        whether this is done by gaining direct control over national policy or by
                        indirect but wider exercise of influence is a question of means to achieve
                        that objective, not the objective itself. Thus if the degree to which
                        Communists have gained direct control of the Government is used as the scale
                        for measuring their success and potential, there is danger of a mistaken
                        estimate for the evidence appears to be that the Communists themselves use
                        the degree to which they can achieve the neutralization of the country as
                        their own scale for measuring success.</p>
                    <p>The most recent developments in Guatemala, concerning the removal of the
                        Supreme Court for opposing the <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>
                        administration in an Agrarian Reform decision, provide an excellent example
                        of the degree of success that the Communists already have in stimulating and
                        exploiting events indirectly through its interlocking machinery (my telegram
                        No. 319, February 11<note n="6" xml:id="d34fn6">Not printed.</note> and
                        previous). Here the Communist Party, barely eighteen months after it came
                        into the open and fifteen months after it established control of the CGTG,
                        set itself an immediate goal—the rapid breaking up of large farms and
                        liquidation of the power potential of the landlords by unrelenting
                        application of the Agrarian Reform Law which was guided through Congress by
                        means of Sr. <persName corresp="#p_GVM1">Gutiérrez</persName>’ Special
                        Committee on Agrarian Reform. To carry out this policy it seemed necessary
                        that the Executive Branch Agrarian Reform authorities act without check from
                        the courts lest the landlords slow up or block the Agrarian Reform through
                        protracted legal proceedings, but on February 2 the Supreme Court in the
                        case of <persName>Sr. Ernesto Leal Perez</persName> in effect ruled that
                        appeals could be made to the courts when the authorities exceeded their
                        legal limits. The Communists then mobilized the CGTG and CNCG in a campaign
                        to have the Supreme Court Justices who made this ruling ousted and, acting
                        in harmony with President <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>, the
                        Communist and pro-Communist Administration leaders in the “revolutionary”
                        parties led a successful floor fight in Congress with the galleries packed
                        with CGTG workers to have the Justices removed for “incapacity”. In so
                        doing, the Congress swept aside the independence of the judiciary and
                        exposed the flimsiness of Guatemalan democracy, an accomplishment which
                        illuminates what the Communists can already do by manipulation and indirect
                        control and raises a substantial question whether in the next several years
                        they may not be able to perfect and extend their machinery to such an extent
                        that <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0100"/>they will be able to achieve
                        their ends without risking an effort to obtain direct control.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing is, of course, a presentation to draw attention to the
                        possibilities which the Communists have of realizing their objective through
                        indirect, rather than direct, means and does not outline the anti-Communist
                        counterweights which are present and potentially important in the current
                        mixed Guatemalan situation. What the actual result will be during the next
                        several years will depend in part on the outcome of the interplay of
                        pro-Communist and anti-Communist factors in Guatemala and, to a large
                        extent, on the ability of the United States to align its policy to advantage
                        in the shifting scene that those years will doubtlessly present.</p>

                    <p>On June 17, 1952, a comprehensive agrarian reform program became law in

                            under provisions of the Agrarian Reform Law of June 17, 1952, of
                            approximately 234,000 acres of United Fruit Company property near

                        objective is the development of a capitalistic agricultural economy through
                        the abolition of semi-feudal owner-worker relationships, the redistribution
                        of land, and the improvement with state assistance of cultivation methods.
                        The implications of the legislation, however, go beyond agrarian reform
                        inasmuch <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0101"/>as its provisions furnish a
                        basis for the strengthening of political and Communist control over the
                        rural population.</p>
                    <p>Full implementation of the law would free thousands of agrarian workers from
                        a centuries-old dependence upon the privileged landholding class, but would
                        subject the majority, in all probability, to close control by the state.
                        This would be exercised through a virtually autonomous National Agrarian
                        Department. Certain limitations, also, would be incumbent upon those using
                        redistributed land. Since the great bulk of the land expropriated would be
                        incorporated into the imprescriptible public domain, holdings could be
                        acquired only on the basis of a life grant or by rental. Private title,
                        however, would be possible by the direct transfer to the peasant of land
                        expropriated from private estates. Another feature of the law facilitating
                        state control is provision for the concentration of agrarian workers on each
                        private plantation into a single village.</p>
                    <p>Administration forces undoubtedly envisage political benefits from the
                        legislation. They are presumably anxious to break the control of the
                        conservative anti-administration large landholders over the farm labor force
                        in order to organize it behind the government. Advantages to the Communists
                        are likely to be enhanced by the opportunity to extend the influence in farm
                        areas through infiltration of the National Agrarian Department, through
                        their expanded control over Guatemalan labor organization, and through
                        greater opportunities to attack the United Fruit Company. The deepening
                        cleavage between moderates and left caused by government sponsorship of the
                        agrarian program will benefit the Communists.</p>
                    <p>Full and rapid implementation of the land distribution program would be
                        likely to produce serious economic repercussions. Already nervousness has
                        depressed business activity. Thus far, however, agricultural production,
                        which provides the basis of Guatemala’s economy, apparently has not been
                        affected.</p>
                    <p>Implementation of the law will be difficult and politically dangerous.
                        Although an abundance of land is made available for redistribution, only a
                        small part of it is desirably located. The extent to which land controlled
                        by foreign agricultural corporations—the greater part of United Fruit
                        Company holdings are possibly subject to expropriation—may be made available
                        for redistribution is largely a matter of speculation. As far as can be
                        ascertained, these enterprises have no special protection under their
                        operating concessions. While they may appeal decisions affecting their
                        interests to the National Agrarian Department, this agency and the civil
                        courts, which probably could not be utilized, are closely subjected to the
                        will of an administration determined to accelerate the agrarian program.
                        Also difficult for the administration to overcome will be the long-standing
                        living habits and prejudices of the largely Indian agrarian population. Most
                        significant of all will be the perfecting of a competent administrative <pb
                            n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0102"/>organization. The strong probability
                        exists that too rapid acceleration of the agrarian program coupled with
                        increasing Communist strength and influence may lead to violence difficult
                        for the <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> administration to

                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item><p><hi rend="italic">Background</hi>. The Agrarian Reform Law which
                                was adopted on June 17, 1952, is rooted in the Guatemalan
                                revolutionary program which since 1944 has been a vital force in the
                                formulation of governmental policy. As groundwork for such
                                legislation, the framers of the Constitution adopted in 1945
                                provided for state direction of the national economy, for the
                                expropriation of unused private lands with prior compensation, for
                                the incorporation of such lands into the national patrimony, for
                                both the rental and granting of nationalized lands, for the
                                formation of agricultural communities, for collective farming, for
                                the protection of ejido and communal lands, and for state technical
                                and other assistance to agricultural communities. These provisions
                                were the product of several influences. Probably foremost was the
                                socialistic and nationalistic philosophy of <persName>Juan Jose
                                    Arevalo</persName>, spiritual lender of the Revolution, whose
                                ideas paralleled but apparently owed little to Marxist ideology.
                                Also evident was the Mexican experience in land reform, implanted in
                                the Constitution in all probability chiefly by <persName>Jorge
                                    García Granados</persName>, President of the Constituent
                                Assembly, who for many years prior to the Revolution had been
                                resident in Mexico.</p>
                            <p>During the seven-year interval between the adoption of the
                                Constitution and the enactment of the Agrarian Reform Law a number
                                of land reform proposals were advanced. Some of these were quite
                                radical and several Communist-sponsored. Almost all advocated the
                                expropriation and division of large privately-owned estates. Except
                                for the passage of compulsory land rental legislation in 1950, no
                                positive action was taken by the <persName>Arevalo</persName>
                                Administration (1945–51). President <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1"
                                    >Jacobo Arbenz</persName>, however, firmly committed himself to
                                agrarian reform and in repeated speeches stressed the inequity of
                                land ownership, the semi-feudal nature of tenancy and laboring
                                arrangements, and the antiquated cultivation methods employed on
                                small holdings. On May 10, 1952, he submitted to the National
                                Congress the draft legislation which became law the following month.
                                In the final preparation and enactment of this program Communists
                                played a prominent role.</p></item>

                                of the law certain land is specifically designated for
                                redistribution. This includes uncultivated land, land not cultivated
                                directly by or for the owner, land rented in any form, land needed
                                to establish rural farm settlements, state farms and certain other
                                national lands, certain municipal lands, and excesses resulting from
                                new surveys prior to expropriation. Excluded, however, are farms of
                                less than 221 acres whether or not cultivated, farms of from 221 to
                                664 <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0103"/>acres if a least
                                two-thirds of this land is cultivated, land belonging to Indian or
                                farm communities, land of agricultural enterprises producing
                                essential crops except land not directly used by the enterprise or
                                exploited by systems established by this law, lands used for cattle
                                raising, lands in the immediate vicinity of Guatemala City and other
                                municipalities, and all legal forest reserves.</p>
                            <p>Of the land available for redistribution under the law, only a small
                                part is desirably located. In the most productive and populous
                                sections of the country, principally the highlands, the
                                privately-owned farms are generally small and exempt from
                                expropriation. Those that are larger are situated almost entirely in
                                the undesirable lowland regions or in inaccessible parts of the
                                highlands. Much of the suitably located and available land is that
                                comprised in the state farms. This situation and the reluctance of
                                the largely Indian agrarian population to migrate to the unhealthful
                                lowlands probably influenced the administration during August and
                                September 1952, in accordance with a previously announced policy, to
                                make the first actual distributions of land from a national
                                plantation and other holdings. In November 1952 arrangements were
                                being completed for the breakup of 110 state farms, and several have
                                since been distributed. Effective December 29, 1952, the Department
                                of National Farms was legally dissolved and its affairs and
                                properties transferred to a liquidating commission pending
                                distribution of the land under the Agrarian Reform Law.</p>
                            <p>The extent to which land controlled by foreign agriculture
                                corporations may be made available for redistribution is largely a
                                matter of speculation. Largest of these enterprises is the United
                                Fruit Company which owns or leases some 450,000 acres possibly
                                subject to expropriation. As far as can be ascertained, special
                                protection to property of the Company appears not to be afforded
                                either by the Agrarian Law or by the clauses of contracts, including
                                land lease arrangements, between the Company and the Guatemalan
                                Government. Article 12 of the Agrarian Reform Law provides that
                                “there will be no difference between natural and juridical persons
                                who own or rent land in this country, even though they may have
                                signed contracts with the state prior to the date of promulgation of
                                this law insofar as the lands affected are concerned.” This article
                                indicates clearly that the Communist-guided framers of the Agrarian
                                Law intended to apply its provisions to foreign enterprises such as
                                the United Fruit Company.</p>
                            <p>The first moves to apply the law to United Fruit Company holdings
                                were made in December 1952 when workers at both the Tiquisate and
                                Bananera subsidiaries filed expropriation applications with the
                                National Agrarian Department. In protesting these proceedings before
                                the Departmental Agrarian Commissions, representatives of the
                                Company pointed out what they regarded as irregularities in the
                                petitions, presented evidence that much of its acreage was exempt
                                from expropriation because it was forested, was pasture, or was
                                producing “technical crops”, <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0104"
                                />and contended that uncultivated lands were needed as a reserve for
                                replacing acreage in bananas forced out of production by plant
                                diseases. The Company also argued that such compensation as might be
                                made would be inadequate if it were based as prescribed by this law
                                upon the tax book value, especially in view of the fact that the
                                Company had sought from 1948 to 1951 to have its land revalued.
                                Moreover, payment in agrarian bonds would be unsatisfactory since
                                they were subject to heavy discounting if cashed soon after issue.
                                Both commissions overruled these arguments and approved the
                                expropriation of the Company’s uncultivated lands. In the Tiquisate
                                case, the commission based its decision on the Company’s inability
                                to show that it was financially able to increase its cultivated
                                acreage, and its failure to sustain with testimony by technical
                                experts the contentions that all uncultivated holdings were required
                                for agricultural purposes. Appeals in both cases were immediately
                                filed by the Company with the National Agrarian Council. This body,
                                in January, reversed the decision of the commission which had
                                handled the Tiquisate case on the grounds that it had failed to
                                specify the right of the Company to contest the commission’s ruling
                                within five days. The ruling, however, gave the Company only a
                                temporary respite, for new petitions were immediately filed which
                                have been approved by the National Agrarian Department and President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>. This action,
                                which would expropriate approximately two-thirds of the Company’s
                                Tiquisate holdings, has been appealed to the Guatemalan Supreme
                                Court.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile, the Company is faced with problem of numerous persons
                                entering its Tiquisate property, staking out claims to unused lands,
                                and making preparations for settling without legal authorization. In
                                that part of the company subsidiary lying in the Department of
                                Suchitepequez, the Governor witnessed the “invasion” and sent
                                soldiers to protect the intruders. On the other hand, the Governor
                                of the Department of Escuintla ordered squatters off the Company’s
                                lands.</p>
                            <p>In view of the proceedings involving the United Fruit Company which
                                have already taken place and the stipulation in the Agrarian Law
                                that no difference exists between “natural and juridical persons”,
                                the Company and other foreign enterprises would appear to be
                                entitled to some legal recourse in case of expropriation. The value
                                of this privilege, however, would be limited by two factors. In the
                                first place, the Agrarian Law provides the cases arising as a result
                                of its implementation may be appealed through the various divisions
                                of the National Agrarian Department to the President, but may not be
                                taken to the civil courts. This limitation, therefore, bars full
                                legal recourse. Secondly, were a constitutional or other loophole to
                                be found for using the civil courts, the appeal, if it reached the
                                Supreme Court, would stand little chance at present of being
                                favorably reviewed since that tribunal is packed with
                                pro-administration judges. Moreover, a Supreme Court decision would
                                be subject to congressional <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0105"
                                />review. The packing of the Court took place in February 1953 when
                                four of the five former justices were replaced after ruling against
                                the expropriation of uncultivated lands belonging to a private
                                landowner who had unsuccessfully appealed his case through the
                                National Agrarian Department to the President of the Republic. The
                                Supreme Court had accepted the case under a constitutional provision
                                which grants a person the right to ask protection or aid (amparo) in
                                a case where he believes the “law, regulation or other order by an
                                authority is not applicable.”</p>
                            <p>If the Agrarian Law is fully implemented, the impact upon private
                                landholders would be borne chiefly by a minority group. The
                                Guatemalan General Directorate of Statistics estimates that of
                                341,191 private agricultural holdings only 1,710 would be affected.
                                These 1,710 holdings, however, comprise more than half of the total
                                private acreage. Their owners would not suffer a drastic loss of
                                cultivated land, but would be prevented from expanding future
                                operations were their uncultivated acreage expropriated. For owners
                                whose property is condemned provision exists for indemnification
                                based upon the generally low tax valuations as of May 9, 1952.
                                Compensation, for which the administration has made initial
                                provision, is to be in bonds bearing 3 percent interest redeemable
                                in 25 years or less. Although the National Agrarian Department
                                planned in late 1952 to begin distributions from private farms, this
                                phase of the agrarian program was not placed in operation until
                                January 1953 when President <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1"
                                    >Arbenz</persName> signed a resolution ordering the first
                                expropriation of four farms in various parts of the country.
                                Financial arrangements for such expropriations had been completed
                                the preceding month with the deposit by the National Agrarian
                                Department in the Bank of Guatemala of $2,500,000 in Agrarian bonds
                                to reimburse landowners.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile, the failure of the Government to proceed more rapidly with
                                private expropriations led to increasing pressure, part of it
                                Communist-inspired, to bring this about. Petitions were sent to the
                                agrarian authorities and to the President, and after the beginning
                                of 1953 the seizure of private lands by farm workers gained impetus
                                throughout the country. The official press warned that only the
                                state could apply the law, but the Administration showed signs of
                                yielding to the pressure by moving to authorize squatters to stay on
                                the land under the compulsory rental laws, by refusing generally to
                                use the police power to protect the private properties involved, and
                                by accelerating the rate of private expropriations.</p></item>

                                by the law is the far-reaching social change of freeing thousands of
                                agrarian workers from a centuries-old dependence upon the privileged
                                large landholding class. Prohibited are existing forms of servitude
                                such as the lending by one landowner to another of the personal
                                services of farm laborers, the forced distribution of Indians, and
                                the payment of rental for land in labor. A provision for the placing

                                one designed to free the Indian peasant from his dependent economic
                                status.</p>
                            <p>Under the agrarian program, however, the rural classes would be
                                subjected to rather close control by the state. This would be
                                exercised through a virtually autonomous National Agrarian
                                Department—headed nominally by the President of the Republic and
                                having national, departmental and local subdivisions—whose influence
                                is enhanced by its responsibility for rendering technical and other
                                assistance. Certain limitations would be incumbent upon those using
                                redistributed land. If the holding were acquired from the
                                imprescriptible public domain, use would be on the basis of a life
                                grant or by rental as long as adequate cultivation were maintained.
                                Private title would be possibly only by the direct transfer to the
                                applicant of land expropriated from private estates. Such holdings
                                would be restricted to 43 acres and would not be transferable to
                                another owner for 25 years. Another feature of the law facilitating
                                state control is provision for the concentration of agrarian workers
                                on each private plantation into a single village and for the
                                nationalization of private roads connecting such communities with

                                Agrarian Law does not provide for the complete breakup of large
                                privately-owned estates, it otherwise harmonizes generally with the
                                program of the Guatemalan Communist Party, which purports to favor
                                “peasant-middle-class agrarian reforms” bringing “the destruction of
                                feudalism and the opening of the way to capitalism, or rather,

                                can be done” and with the admission that it is not feasible to go
                                further at the present time. Rapid implementation of the law,
                                however, was urged at a Party Congress held in December 1952.</p>
                            <p>Under the law the Communists have an excellent opportunity to extend
                                their influence over the rural population. One method of
                                accomplishing this is through the representation in the various
                                subdivisions of the National Agrarian Department to which the two
                                major labor confederations are entitled. The Communist-controlled
                                General Confederation of Workers (Confederación General de
                                Trabajadores de Guatemala, CGTG) and the Communist-influenced
                                National Confederation of Farm Workers (Confederación Nacional
                                Campesina de Guatemala, CNCG) have 60 percent of the seats in the
                                local agrarian commissions, 40 percent in the departmental
                                commissions, and one-third in the national commission. Already
                                Communists and their sympathizers have infiltrated the National
                                Agrarian Department so extensively that they exert an important
                                voice in both policy making and in the implementation of the
                                law.</p>
                            <p>At the same time, the Communists are tightening their grip on the
                                rural classes by using the law in other ways. Working chiefly
                                through the CGTG and the CNCG, they are propagandizing in behalf of
                                the law, are <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0107"/>stimulating farm
                                workers to petition for the redistribution of land, and are helping
                                applicants in their negotiations with the National Agrarian
                                Department. Communist leaders also are taking the initiative
                                resisting the efforts of private landowners to appeal their cases
                                from the National Agrarian Department to the civil courts. Virtually
                                no opposition exists to these activities. A basic reason for this is
                                that the Agrarian Law provides severe penalties for interference
                                with its implementation. Other factors redounding to the advantage
                                of the Communists are an expansion of organizational activities in
                                farm areas by both the CGTG and the CNCG, and the deepened cleavage
                                between moderates and left produced by government sponsorship of the
                                law.</p></item>

                                political benefits from the legislation. They are presumably anxious
                                to eliminate all control of the conservative, anti-administration
                                large landholders over the farm labor force. With this accomplished,
                                agrarian workers could be unionized under auspices and with benefits
                                which would virtually assure their support of the administration.
                                Aside from these broad political advantages, administration leaders
                                will find in the agrarian reform program a greatly enlarged field
                                for graft and patronage. Already the President has moved to keep
                                implementation of the law in his hands by appointing as Chief of the

                                Government. To finance the operations of the National Agrarian
                                Department, a budget of $404,470 for fiscal 1952–53 was approved in
                                November 1952 by the National Congress.</p>
                            <p>During 1952, implementation of the Agrarian Law proceeded slowly and
                                produced some confusion and controversy. Many misinformed rural
                                workers evidenced keen disappointment when informed that lands
                                exempt from expropriation could not be distributed to them. Under
                                Communist inspiration, pressure mounted for more rapid distribution.
                                The acceleration of the program became the central issue of the
                                1952–53 congressional electoral campaign and has been officially
                                marked as the primary government objective for 1953. In the course
                                of the accelerated land distribution program, “squatting” and forced
                                seizures by the peasantry have taken place and have been upheld by

                    <p>The adoption on June 17, 1952 of a comprehensive agrarian reform program
                        presages significant sociological, economic and political changes in
                        Guatemala. Full implementation of the law would free thousands of agrarian
                        workers from a centuries-old dependence upon the privileged landholding
                        class, but would subject the majority, in all probability, to close control
                        by the state through supervision by a virtually autonomous National Agrarian
                        Department, through limitation upon land usage, through population
                        concentrations, and through the extension of technical and other
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>Full and rapid implementation of the land distribution program would be
                        likely to produce serious economic repercussions. Already nervousness has
                        depressed business activity. Thus far, however, agricultural production,
                        which provides the basis of Guatemala’s economy, apparently has not been
                        affected.</p>
                    <p>Administration forces in all probability will use the law to eliminate all
                        control of the conservative, large landholding classes over farm workers.
                        With the assistance of the Communists, who will take advantage of the
                        opportunity to extend their influence over the rural classes, a stronger
                        backing for the government should result. Advantages to the Communists also
                        are likely to be enhanced by greater opportunities to attack the United
                        Fruit Company, and by the deepening cleavage between moderates and left
                        resulting from government sponsorship of the reform program.</p>
                    <p>Foreign agricultural enterprises, especially the United Fruit Company, will
                        probably have their uncultivated holdings expropriated since they appear to
                        have no special protection under their operating concessions. While they may
                        appeal decisions affecting their interests to the National Agrarian
                        Department, this agency and the civil courts, which probably could not be
                        utilized, are so closely subjected to the will of the administration that
                        such recourse would avail little.</p>
                    <p>Implementation of the law will be difficult because of the unavailability of
                        suitably located land, because of the long-standing living habits and
                        prejudices of the largely Indian agrarian population, and because of the
                        likelihood that a competent administrative organization cannot be perfected.
                        The strong probability exists that too rapid acceleration of the agrarian
                        program coupled with increasing Communist strength and influence may lead to
                        violence difficult for the <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>

                        dependent on its trade relations with us and has discounted the fact that we

                                should be given a look over. I just received the visit of two
                                American citizens highly recommended who have large interests in the
                                country. They indicated that they did not feel they could get
                                anything whatever out of the Embassy in the way of protection of
                                American interests and hinted at darker things. They came to me

                            meeting held with officers from the Division of Research; it reads in
                            part: “Attached paper was reviewed, paragraph by paragraph, and serious
                            objections taken by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> representatives
                            to the estimate that a substantial rise in anti-U.S. feeling in Latin
                            America might be created by supplying of arms to El Salvador, Honduras,
                            and Nicaragua. It was pointed out to representatives of the Department
                            of State that only the adverse effects of such an action were mentioned
                            in the paper, and none of the beneficial effects. It was also indicated
                            that an armed action by these three countries against Guatemala would
                            result in a unification of the Guatemalan people behind <persName

                            fighting, say for a period of months. This would be highly improbable
                            because an attack by the three countries would be launched only if they
                            were convinced that they had the means to bring about rapid military
                            success. Numerous other minor points were objected to in the paper, and
                            the conclusion was, at the end of the meeting, that a new draft would
                            have to be made by the State Department.”</note></head>

                            probably would seriously affect the Guatemalan Army. It would cause
                            concern among the high command and would stimulate conspiratorial
                            activity on the part of small, already disaffected army elements.</item>

                        <item>Although the concern of the Guatemalan Army leaders probably will
                            involve initial resentment against the United States and a preference to

                            military are eventually likely to recognize that military aid to
                            neighboring countries is an expression of US determination to eliminate
                            Communist leadership and influence in Guatemala. In this
                            circumstance—and barring effective external sympathy and support— the
                            Army high command is likely to calculate in terms of increased
                            disaffection among lower echelon officer personnel, emboldened action by
                            elements of the political opposition, an increase in the number of
                            revolutionary attempts against the government, the loss of military
                            position and political leadership in Central America, and new defensive
                            requirements along Guatemala’s borders.</item>

                        <item>It is probable that these calculations would ultimately cause at least
                            a split among top Army leaders, some of whom would be willing to attempt
                            deals with overt and covert oppositionist elements. Groups with which
                            some present army leaders could negotiate successfully include elements
                            of the urban opposition who, although anti-Communistic, are also
                            strongly nationalistic and who would favor continuance of many aspects
                            of the revolutionary program. The present military leaders neither would
                            nor could negotiate with opposition contained in the pre-revolutionary
                            landholder-military elite. Without the united support of the Army, the

                    <p>The United States Army Attaché in Honduras reports as of 8 June that
                            <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas</persName>,
                        former Guatemalan Army Officer who has been implicated in anti-Government
                        activities and is now a resident in Honduras, is planning to oust President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> of Guatemala. The source
                        of the Army Attaché’s information, whose nationality is not known, claims to
                        be one of <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo</persName>’s “Lieutenants”.
                        The report is summarized as follows: The attempt is to be made within 90
                        days. The organization has purchased half a million dollars worth of
                        military equipment <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0115"/>including arms and
                        ammunition sufficient to equip 3,000 men. The plan is to land 1,000 men at
                        Puerto Barrios to establish a beachhead and then move by rail to Guatemala
                        City. In the meantime Guatemala City will be “softened up” by air.
                        Sympathizers will join the force en route to Guatemala City and a motor
                        column will cross the Guatemala border from El Salvador. All forces will
                        converge on Guatemala City. Army units except those in Guatemala City are
                        expected to back the move.</p>

                            Armas</persName> is quite possible but its success is unlikely. There is
                        no information available to corroborate the various details given by the
                        Attaché’s source, and it is quite probable that there is considerable
                        exaggeration and wishful thinking in the report. <persName

                        unlikely, at least until the movement shows a good chance of success.

                        be easily blocked. Furthermore, a movement on the scale indicated would

                        <item>During the past year the Government of Guatemala and Communist
                            elements within that country have strengthened their position. Army
                            officers have been treated as a privileged class and every effort has
                            been made to insure the assignment of reliable men to key positions.
                            Implementation of the Agrarian Reform Law has further ingratiated the
                            Government with the lower classes. Conversely, the position of
                            opposition elements has deteriorated. Obvious inability to organize an
                            effective program discouraged some previously militant and caused others
                            to avoid risking revolutionary associations. Further, the abortive
                            Salama uprising forces a number of key opposition figures to flee the
                            country and may have reduced their organizations to relative
                            ineffectiveness. Many diverse and potentially powerful elements opposed
                            to the present regime do remain, however, and would welcome the
                            opportunity to act. It is, none the less, improbable that the <pb n="88"

                            effective potential leader for a revolutionary effort. Necessary
                            contacts with him have been made and extensive groundwork laid. Detailed
                            plans, however, require review to determine their soundness in view of
                            conditions altered during the past year and, particularly, to ascertain
                            whether <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> still has the personnel

                        <item>Until July of this year it appeared possible that certain

                                >RUFUS</gloss> to permit action. Strong interest was expressed,
                            promises actually made, but broken at the last minute. Our clear
                            instructions, since October 1952, have been to avoid any act which could
                            be considered as “sparking” the revolutionary movement, but to be
                            prepared to assist. It is now evident that insufficient help will be

                            briefed regarding the present situation in Guatemala by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Frank Wisner</persName> on 1 September 1953.
                            Present were Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLJ1">J. Lampton
                            Berry</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KCJC1">Colonel J.C.
                                King</persName>, and [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>].
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> pointed out that
                            conditions in Guatemala are obviously adverse to U.S. interests in view
                            of the close working alliance between the administration of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Jacobo Arbenz</persName> and the
                            Communist Party. It was noted that this alliance, through formation of a
                            Communist affiliated labor confederation, persecution of foreign
                            economic interests, enactment and implementation of a confiscatory
                            agrarian reform law, court packing and conduct of an aggressively
                            anti-American, pro-Communist publicity campaign, has achieved virtual
                            dominance over national political and economic life. Further, it was
                            observed that the four Communist controlled political parties which
                            comprise the administration coalition hold 51 of the 56 seats in
                            congress, while Communists dominate the National Electoral Board, the
                            Agrarian Department, the Institute of Social Security, the Labor Courts,
                            the Ministry of Education, the Secretariat of Propaganda and the
                            official press and radio. Mentioned, among effects of this alliance upon
                            Guatemalan foreign relations, were the active support of leftist
                            elements in other Central American countries through provision of bases,
                            press and communication facilities, cash, transportation, agents and
                            assassins.</item>

                        <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJE1">Peurifoy</persName> was advised that
                            this Agency has now been authorized to take strong action against the
                            government of President <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> in
                            the hope of facilitating a change to a more democratically oriented
                            regime. Some of the past preliminary planning and activity toward this
                            end was reviewed and the point clearly established that success might
                            depend, to a great extent, upon support of our activities by the
                            American Ambassador to Guatemala within the limitations of the “need to
                            know” policy. It was particularly noted that excessive security measures
                            on the part of an ambassador which result in hampering agent activity
                            through unusual limitations of communication and the imposition of time
                            consuming burdens of cover activity are plainly not appropriate. It was
                            also stressed that no aspect of this operation is cleared for discussion
                            with any save specifically designated individuals.</item>

                            positive action and would be prepared to support the program as American
                            Ambassador to Guatemala. For planning purposes he gave 15 October 1953
                            as a possible date for his arrival in that country.<note n="2"

                            including the military action plan. This was done primarily for the

                        <item>It was evident that KS’s thinking, planning and liaison with the
                                <gloss target="#t_PA1">P/A</gloss>, (R), have so far been based on
                            estimates of relatively limited support primarily on the part of “the
                            Company.” Hence his points of view up to now are somewhat restricted.
                            Furthermore, it should be noted for the sake of order that KS’s views
                            are somewhat colored by the fact that he has had to identify himself
                            very closely with the <gloss target="#t_PA1">P/A</gloss> and his cause
                            over a period of time.</item>

                        <item><p>There is no doubt that KS believes strongly in <gloss

                                (R) and his overt as well as covert organization. KS admits,
                                however, that there is no tangible proof to date as to the scope and
                                potential of the covert setup inside the country. This is partly due
                                to the fact that KS has avoided any kind of pressure on R to “test”
                                internal capabilities or deliver “proof” in the form of names,
                                locations and numbers of covert elements and their leaders.</p>
                            <p>Considering that the operation now will be Government (U.S.)

                                were rapidly dwindling. KS stated, as his personal conviction:

                                is weak. His available assets outside the target country are
                                negligible. His plan of action is based entirely on expected popular
                                support. There is no evidence that such popular support would be
                                forthcoming. There are no actual proofs of any effective covert

                                long as it remains united.” In this connection, it is noteworthy
                                that there is no evidence to indicate that the regular army is

                        bombs. He noted, however: “Capture of Guatemala City at the outset of the
                        movement will require the immobilization or assassination of the key
                        civilian members of the Government as well as immobilization of a majority
                        of the officers.”</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the meeting, the source agreed that his organization
                        would prepare a detailed plan and timetable while the <gloss

                        The U.S. Army Attaché is considered the best man in the Embassy and his

                        reveals no internal conditions that could be developed into a vital threat
                        to the present <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> administration
                        without determined support from the outside.</p>
                    <p>Though it is pointed out that the main political opposition to the government
                        is located in the capital city, it is also stated that, although the
                        dissatisfaction of important urban elements will probably increase,
                        effective political unity among these elements is not likely to be achieved.
                        The political union of urban and rural interests is even less likely.</p>
                    <p>Additional information appears to indicate that previously available active
                        resistance to the government is decreasing rapidly due to general
                        discouragement, especially after an abortive uprising earlier this year,
                        which resulted in the imprisonment and/or exile of important opposition
                        leaders.</p>
                    <p>It is further estimated that the army is the only organized element in
                        Guatemala capable of rapidly and decisively altering the political situation
                        and that there is no reason to doubt the continued loyalty of the army high
                        command and most of the army to the President, who in turn is under the
                        direct and indirect influence of Communist officials in key government posts
                        and firmly entrenched within pro-Administration political parties.</p>
                    <p>Military units outside the capital are reported to have little potential for
                        effective revolutionary action due to poor equipment, lack of training and
                        the vigilance and security measures of trusted area commanders.</p>
                    <p>The police force (3500) could neither defeat an army coup nor itself
                        overthrow the government without army support.</p>

                    <p>Another of the few organized elements of any consequence, the Catholic
                        Church, is reportedly handicapped by the meagerness of its resources, the
                        small number of priests in proportion to population, the fact that most
                        priests are aliens subject to deportation, and the lack of a program capable
                        of competing with the Communist-led labor movement or with agrarian
                        reform.</p>
                    <p>A study of a recent evaluation of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s
                        political and psychological warfare operations indicates that past efforts
                        by the Agency to combat communism in Guatemala have been hampered by a
                        policy of extreme caution adhered to by State Department representatives in
                        the field. As a result of this, existing <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                        assets personnelwise and otherwise in respect to psychological warfare and
                        political action within Guatemala are negligible.</p>
                    <p>The main operational asset immediately available to <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                            >CIA</gloss> is a group of revolutionary activists numbering a few
                        hundred, led by an exiled Guatemalan army officer (<gloss target="#t_RUFUS1"
                            >RUFUS</gloss>) and located in Honduras. More than a year ago, some
                        planning within the Agency contemplated the implementation of an ambitious
                        militant plan of revolutionary action on the part of <gloss
                            target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> and his group. For a variety of reasons
                        this operation was indefinitely postponed; meanwhile <gloss

                        American interests. He allegedly controls considerable clandestine elements
                        and contacts within Guatemala; in fact the above-mentioned operation would
                        have depended for its success on immediate popular support of <gloss

                        active assistance of an extensive underground resistance organization and
                        certain outlying army garrisons, as soon as <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1"
                            >RUFUS</gloss> and his men entered the country.</p>

                    <p>In light of existing conditions in Guatemala, with the government steadily
                        strengthening its position, and active opposition deteriorating, the
                        original <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> plan is now considered
                        substantially obsolete. It is disturbing that reports from the <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> case officer indicate that unless the
                            <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> asset is operationally activated
                        within a very short time (maximum 120 days), it will be subjected to a
                        serious morale problem, and <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss>’ alleged
                        clandestine support organization within Guatemala is likely to disintegrate
                        along with other government opposition.</p>
                    <p>Undoubtedly there are means and ways of maintaining the <gloss

                        supporters would have to be preceded by elaborate covert psywar, political
                        action, sabotage and similar operations that would require a time-consuming
                        build-up of Agency assets of various kinds, including the placement of
                        qualified personnel in the field.</p>

                    <p>In this connection, it would be the primary concern of <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to ascertain the existence, scope and
                        potential of alleged Guatemalan covert resistance elements, and alleged
                        clandestine contacts suitable for psychological warfare and political action
                        purposes, as well as for possible active support of a para-military effort
                        at a later date.</p>
                    <p>There is a general feeling of urgency in respect to action against Guatemala
                        on the part of State and Agency officials connected with this priority task,
                        but also a growing realization of the fact that existing operational assets
                        do not permit any optimistic viewpoints relative to speedy success within a
                        relatively short period of time.</p>
                    <p>It is recognized that the task headed by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                        calls for a general, over-all plan of combined overt and covert action of
                        major proportions. Some steps have already been taken to initiate certain
                        preparatory measures in regard to supporting overt action and other US

                        <item><persName corresp="#p_SGWBS1">General Smith</persName> indicated his
                            strong agreement with our recommendation that some form of State
                            Department rejoinder or rebuttal be dealt out to the Guatemalans. He
                            held on to my memorandum which he promised not to show to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJM1">Cabot</persName>, and he said that he was going to

                            and do something about this. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLJ1"
                                >Berry</persName> presented a brief memorandum proposing a planted
                            question and an answer for the Secretary to make at his next press

                            accepted this but said that he wished to do more. He rang for <persName

                        <item>I raised the subject of Honduras and said that our point here was that
                            greater strength was needed in the Embassy since there will be an
                            important role for Honduras to play. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLJ1"
                                >Berry</persName> spoke up saying that the present Ambassador is “an
                            old fuddyduddy” who has served out his period of usefulness and who
                            should be replaced by a younger and more vigorous man. <persName

                            interested in this, and said that he would ask Mr.
                                <persName>Lourie</persName> to take the appropriate action. He rang
                            for Mr. <persName>Lourie</persName> who had apparently gone home. Mr.

                                <persName corresp="#p_SGWBS1">General Smith</persName> said that he

                            his own doorbells; that he (<persName corresp="#p_SGWBS1">General

                    <p>Colonel <persName>Barrios Peña</persName> said that on August 31 a military
                        and political committee met in San Salvador to unify the opposition forces
                        against the <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> Government. All
                        leading Guatemalan oppositionists attended except <persName
                            corresp="#p_CACC1">Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas</persName>, who sent a
                        letter declining to affiliate on the ground of having other commitments. In
                        a later meeting between <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo
                            Armas</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_YFGM1">General Miguel
                            Ydigoras Fuentes</persName>, a member of the military and political
                        committee, <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> renewed
                        his refusal to join the group.</p>
                    <p><persName>Barrios Peña</persName> said it was notorious throughout Central
                        America that <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> received
                        large sums of money from the United Fruit Company. In Tegucigalpa he had
                        several limousines, numerous body guards, 34 exiled Guatemalan students; and
                        he had a large body of spies and agents engaged elsewhere; the total monthly
                        expenditures amounting to about $30,000. <persName corresp="#p_CACC1"
                            >Castillo Armas</persName> was known to be entirely without resources of
                        his own. Despite the absurd ostentation of <persName corresp="#p_CACC1"
                            >Castillo Armas</persName>’ heavily financed activities in Honduras, the
                        Guatemalan Government has never said a word about him, but when the United
                        States Government merely asked for just compensation for expropriated
                        property, a storm of insults broke out against the U.S. on the theme of
                        “intervention”. This raised the suspicion that there was some kind of
                        understanding with <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>, but the
                        worst, according to <persName>Barrios Peña</persName>, was that <persName
                            corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> was actively spying on and
                        working against honest oppositionists who were using their own sources<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d57fn2">A handwritten note in the margin reads “<persName
                                corresp="#p_TMRL1">Trujillo</persName>?”.</note> and making great
                        personal sacrifices for a patriotic cause. <persName corresp="#p_CACC1"
                            >Castillo Armas</persName>’ refusal to join in a united front divided
                        the opposition to the <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>
                        Government and this, coupled with his sabotage of other people’s efforts,
                        assured continued success of the Communist cause. <persName>Barrios
                            Peña</persName> said he had come <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0148"
                        />to the United States to tell the heads of the United Fruit Company of the
                        great damage which their support of the deceitful <persName
                            corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> was doing to the
                        anti-Communist cause, to the company itself, and to the United States
                        Government, which was being linked to the United Fruit Company through
                        effective Communist propaganda. All his group wanted was to be left alone
                        and not stabbed in the back by the United Fruit Company and its man,
                            <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName>. However, he
                        said, Mr. <persName>Montgomery</persName> and other United Fruit Company
                        officials had foolishly refused even to see him. He had therefore determined
                        to give his information to the Department and to the
                            <persName>McCarthy</persName> Committee.</p>
                    <p><persName>Barrios Peña</persName> said his organization had prepared an
                        uprising in Guatemala for March 28, 1953, execution of which was dependent
                        on arrival in San Salvador of a coordinating emissary from a secure outside
                        source of assistance. The emissary failed to arrive when expected and
                            <persName>Barrios Peña</persName> accordingly cancelled the operation.
                        His subordinate, <persName>Carlos Simons</persName>, nevertheless set off
                        the abortive Salamá uprising on his own responsibility and thus needlessly
                        sacrificed lives and brought about complete suppression of oppositionist
                        leadership in Guatemala. <persName>Barrios Peña</persName> later went to the
                        outside source of assistance and asked why the emissary failed to
                            arrive.<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">A handwritten marginal note reads
                                “<persName corresp="#p_TMRL1">Trujillo</persName>.”</note> He was
                        told that <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> had sent
                        word that <persName>Barrios Peña</persName> was a spy for <persName
                            corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>, and that the emissary was therefore
                        withheld.</p>
                    <p>I questioned the credibility of reports that any American interest was
                        financing revolutionary forces in Central America. <persName>Barrios
                            Peña</persName> said that although he had no documentary evidence, there
                        was no shadow of doubt in his mind that the United Fruit Company was in fact
                        contributing heavily to <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo
                            Armas</persName>. He thought the company had already invested about $2
                        million in him. He attributed the company’s confidence in <persName
                            corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> to <persName
                            corresp="#p_CCJ1">Juan Cordoba Cerna</persName>, who was retained by the
                        United Fruit Company as counsel for several years. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CCJ1">Cordoba Cerna</persName> had such faith in <persName
                            corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> that he sent his own
                        20-year-old son with him in the attempt to seize the <hi rend="italic">Base
                            Militar</hi> in Guatemala City in November 1950. The boy was killed in
                        the terrible ambush which resulted. According to Lic.
                            <persName>Flores</persName>, over 100 men were shot down by <persName
                            corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>’ forces, only <persName
                            corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> and two others escaping.
                        Most were mowed down by machine guns inside the <hi rend="italic">Base
                            Militar</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> had
                        brought them there in an incredibly stupid attempt to seize the internal
                        arsenal and take over the fort. After the machine gunning, Army officers
                        finished off everyone with pistol shots except, strangely enough, <persName
                            corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> and the other two.
                        Furthermore, after only six weeks in the penitentiary <persName
                            corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> recovered from his
                        superficial <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0149"/>leg wound and escaped.
                        He was said to have tunneled through a stone court under an enormous stone
                        wall and up through the pavement of the street outside, all with his bare
                        hands.</p>
                    <p><persName>Barrios Peña</persName> reiterated that he was asking for nothing
                        except that the Department use its influence to stop the company from
                        supporting <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> in his
                        activity against other oppositionists. Lic. <persName>Flores</persName>
                        added that he and other anti-Communist leaders of long-standing were growing
                        discouraged and resentful over the unnecessary obstacles put in their way,
                        citing the <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> situation
                        and adding that the United States was still supporting the <persName
                            corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> Government through military
                        missions, etc. They also complained of the U.S. Immigration rules, which
                        they thought should be relaxed in favor of Latin American
                        anti-Communists.</p>
                    <p>Colonel <persName>Barrios Peña</persName> handed me a sheaf of documents (in

                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The communist power-drive in Guatemala has reached an advanced
                                state of infiltration, they hold key positions in (a) the agrarian
                                movement, (b) the labor movement, (c) government administration
                                short of cabinet level.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>President <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>, who is
                                half Swiss, has a granite streak of stubbornness in addition to his
                                volatility and is firmly convinced that he can deal with the
                                communists whenever he has to. This optimism is not shared by
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SRE1">Schoenfeld</persName>, who
                                feels that <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> has not
                                even begun to appreciate the real purposes and techniques of
                                communism as a power-seeking movement, not a social reform.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>On the anti-communist side, there are very few positions of
                                strength. The church is extremely weak, all of its property having
                                been confiscated, and a strong anti-clerical attitude exists. The
                                intellectuals are either bemused by the appeals of communism, or are
                                hypersensitive to the U.S. The land-owners are strictly apolitical
                                and will not permit themselves, or their sons, to engage in
                                political activity. They feel that Guatemalan politics has three
                                unattractive destinations: the palace, the jail, or the cemetery.
                                The independent press, however, is very alert to the communist
                                danger.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Guatemala represents in miniature all of the social cleavages,
                                tensions, and dilemmas of modern Western society under attack by the
                                communist virus. Conditions will worsen considerably before we can
                                improve them, and we should regard Guatemala as a prototype area for
                                testing means and methods of combatting communism.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>It will be of primary importance for U.S. labor organizations to
                                encourage the growth of free trade unions in Guatemala, for U.S.
                                corporations to adopt enlightened labor policy in the area, and for

                        <item>The conference was opened by the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss>
                            with the statement: “This is a top priority operation for the whole
                            agency and is the most important thing we are doing. I am under pressure
                            by others to get on with this.” The <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss>
                            then discussed the procedures involved in applying economic pressure
                            through the coffee buyers in the U.S., suggesting that perhaps through
                            the proper agencies in the U.S. a rumor could be circulated that current
                            Guatemalan coffee contained harmful fungi and therefore would have to be
                            barred from the U.S. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]
                            commented that although the idea would be excellent, the danger existed
                            that the coffee buyers, already having been approached and cognizant of
                            our interest would “smell a rat,” and possibly embarrass us through the
                            press as certain buyers have already evidenced a lack of cooperation.
                            Further, such action as denying shipment of coffee already paid for
                            would constitute heavy financial losses to these buyers who, lacking
                            proper motivation, might set up hue and cry, thus injuring the program.
                            Based upon these latter comments, the <gloss target="#t_DCI1"
                                >DCI</gloss> telephoned an unidentified person and informed him to
                            “lay off that coffee idea until further notice.” [<hi rend="italic">name

                            information should be sent to the field on this project which would
                            reveal details of the program—this included official stations. He asked
                            whether the FBI should be informed of our plans for [<hi rend="italic"
                                >less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] and was told
                            that it should be. Accordingly, the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss>
                            said that he would handle the matter personally with the Director, FBI,
                            at the proper time. Regarding the status of the military negotiations in
                            the three neighboring countries it was explained that the State Dept.
                            could take no further action until a certain letter, requesting such
                            action, had been received from the Dept. of Defense. The <gloss

                            was discussed and it was explained that more personnel were required

                            program. <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> said that he did not want
                            any red tape to interfere with this project and he wanted to make

                                    >Document 65</ref>.</note> and I recommend that you approve it

                        <item>Actually the plan is stated in such broad terms that it is not
                            possible to know exactly what it contemplates, particularly in the
                            latter phases. However, I do not regard this as a particular drawback
                            since a vastly-detailed plan prepared at this time would have to be
                            modified in any case. Moreover, the approach specified in this paper
                            calls for the preparation of a detailed operational plan for top level
                            approval at the conclusion of Stage One (the assessment phase).</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Regarding the “ultimatum” specified under Stage Five, it was
                            understood in our discussion that this was not agreed to and would be
                            given further consideration.</item>

                        <item>The proposed <gloss target="#t_TO1">T/O</gloss> does not seem to me to
                            be excessive, given the importance of this project and the degree of
                            priority attached to it. It is my understanding that this <gloss
                                target="#t_TO1">T/O</gloss> does not take into account the
                            Headquarters personnel who will continue to be used to backstop the
                            operation from Washington. It may even develop that some additional
                            personnel will be required as events develop. (For example, I see no
                            provision for the necessary communications personnel and radio
                            technicians, who I am sure will be needed.)</item>

                        <item>I recommend also the concept of assigning to the operational field

                            operational responsibility and I further recommend the command channel

                            as having been raised with you by the Secretary of State, I have given

                        <item>It would be undesirable for the U.S. military mission presently in

                                <item>By the maintenance of daily contact with top-ranking officers
                                    of the Guatemalan military forces, and without resorting to any
                                    covert activities of a compromising character, to observe and
                                    report at regular and frequent intervals on the general morale
                                    and attitude of the Guatemalan armed forces toward the present
                                    Guatemalan regime. [The channel for such reporting could be
                                    determined after further study, but it might be desirable for
                                    this information to be reported to the Ambassador, and by him
                                    made available for “his own information and guidance,” but
                                    actually to be forwarded via our channels of

                                <item>By taking advantage of normal contacts and associations with
                                    ranking representatives of the Guatemalan armed forces, to pass
                                    on to them selected statements and observations best calculated
                                    to weaken the morale and shake the faith of the Guatemalan armed
                                    forces in the present Guatemalan regime. [It should be
                                    relatively simple to devise the type and kind of statement and
                                    observation to be passed on in this manner and for this purpose
                                    in such a way as to avoid or at least minimize the risk of
                                    charges that the military mission was engaging in improper
                                    activities. For example, the U.S. military personnel might
                                    strike a sympathetic and regretful note in their
                                    conversations—pointing out that while programs of military
                                    assistance are being authorized for neighboring states, it has
                                    been impossible for them to obtain any Washington support for
                                    their requests and suggestions. They could speculate that the
                                    explanation for this difficult matter might result from high
                                    level Washington resentment over the policies and official
                                    declarations of the Guatemalan government which are seemingly
                                    hostile to the United States.] One of the most important types
                                    of information which we require is information concerning the
                                    morale and attitude of the Guatemalan armed forces and this
                                    would be the most natural and ready source of such information.
                                    If the contacts between the members of the U.S. military mission
                                    and their opposite numbers were as close as they could and
                                    should be, it should be possible to observe from time to time
                                    the results of other activities and efforts contemplated under
                                    the project upon the thinking and feeling of the Guatemalan
                                    military, including particularly the degree of firmness and
                                    loyalty of the armed forces. In no other way would it be as easy
                                    to observe and follow this vital aspect of the entire
                                    matter.</item>

                        <item><persName corresp="#p_KCJC1">J.C. King</persName> has underscored the
                            point that if the U.S. military mission is to be withdrawn, this is the
                            wrong time to do so. Its withdrawal <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146"
                                facs="0176"/>at the present time would be a substantially empty
                            gesture and would create no particular reverberation. (It would be an
                            almost insignificant tap on the wrist if done now.) The impact of the
                            withdrawal would be much greater if this were done at a later time and
                            after the other aspects of the psychological build-up had gained
                            momentum and begun to have effect.</item>

                        <item>In order to gain the benefits above referred to, two or three steps
                            would probably be required, viz: <list>

                                <item>The present personnel of the mission should be carefully
                                    assessed with a view to determining their competence and
                                    qualifications to engage in the two lines of activity
                                    recommended. Our Station Chief is expected here toward the end
                                    of the week and we can get a rundown from him on the
                                    characteristics and qualifications of the present members of the
                                    military mission. It might be desirable to substitute certain
                                    more qualified officers for present members of the mission in
                                    certain instances.</item>

                                <item>In any case, it would be necessary for the Chief of the
                                    mission to be recalled to Washington for a thorough briefing and
                                    cut-in to the extent necessary (which would not have to be too
                                    much) to enable him to give direction to the efforts of his
                                    staff. Presumably this briefing would be given by the
                                    appropriate military authorities, possibly by General
                                        <persName>Erskine</persName> or under his aegis.</item>

                            with the Director and Deputy Director, I talked with <persName

                            military mission, which he surmises may include individuals who may be

                        <item>JC stated he wanted to ship 15 tons of arms now in New York to
                            Nicaragua at once in order to test <persName corresp="#p_SGA1"
                                >Somoza</persName>’s alleged agreement to cooperate. [<hi
                                rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] took strong exception to
                            this proposal, pointing out that the entire subject of handling arms was
                            fraught with peril from the security point of view and great danger as
                            to control, owing to the possibility once the arms were in the hands of
                            certain people they might go off on their own, thus aborting the
                            program. It was explained that the new concept does not necessarily
                            involve a very large shipment of arms to Nicaragua but, contrarily, only
                            that those actually required for training of the cadre classes at Pto.
                            Cabezas be shipped. Further, that the arms would be compartmented and
                            would be delivered to various places in order to achieve maximum control
                            and secrecy. The problem of getting arms from Nicaragua to jump-off
                            points in Honduras and Salvador is in itself a serious problem of
                            logistics and sufficiently disadvantageous to warrant holding such arms

                            could be distributed to specific teams, both by clandestine entry
                            through Nicaragua overland and by black air-drop. JC weighed these
                            objections and withdrew his decision to ship arms at once to Nicaragua.
                            Another important factor involved in this discussion—it was pointed out
                            by [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] that the shipment of
                            arms should not proceed in advance of the military negotiations with
                            Nicaragua as we must first be sure that <persName corresp="#p_SGA1"

                        <item>Gen. <persName>Balmer</persName> informed me yesterday “that he had
                            run up against opposition on the working level in the Pentagon”. This
                            opposition was particularly on the part of Army, whereas Air Force
                            appeared more cooperative. According to Gen. <persName>Balmer</persName>
                            “there was a marked reluctance on the part of certain Army officers in
                            the Pentagon to have their military missions, or the heads of same,
                            engaged in intelligence activities”. Gen. <persName>Balmer</persName>
                            emphasized that this was strictly a “working level attitude” on the part
                            of Army and suggested that we think the matter over and discuss the

                            addition to their routine duties. But rather that we were asking members
                            of the military missions to pay specific attention to information that
                            they would in any case accumulate during their day–to–day liaison within
                            Guatemalan military circles; the only difference being that they would

                            “Report on Stage One,” dated December 15, drafted by [<hi rend="italic"
                                >name not declassified</hi>] and approved by <persName
                                corresp="#p_KCJC1">King</persName>. The report noted that the
                            element of surprise had been lost and that the opposition consisted of
                            100 “top–flight” Communists who had been to the Soviet Union. In
                            comparison the pro–Western forces included only two “more or less”
                            untested leaders with liabilities: “Neither man is effectively
                            controlled by <gloss target="#t_PBSPBSUCCESS1">PBSUCCESS</gloss> to
                            date, and achievement of control may be complicated by past financial
                            largess on the part of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.” In
                            addition, “Past security practices of both men have been poor.” The
                            report also noted that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had only
                            limited capabilities in Guatemala: “The Station has no penetrations of
                            the PGT, government agencies, armed forces, or labor unions.”
                            Nevertheless, based on information from the Station in Guatemala, the
                            “possible pool of passive supporters of anti–Communism” might total
                            “perhaps 90%” of the politically active population, and that “there is
                            recent evidence of widespread, if still latent, officer dissatisfaction
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> and the
                            Communists.” The report concluded that it was “normal for revolution” to
                            start with a few men, however, and posited four recommendations: “A.
                            That the concept of proceeding on the basis of potential assets, rather
                            than on the basis of existing assets, be approved; B. That, keeping in
                            mind that the U.S. national interest, as defined by the National
                            Security Council, requires a change of government in Guatemala, the TOP

                                >PBSUCCESS</gloss> be formally assured for at least six months; C.
                            That definite, high–level accord be maintained that any Guatemalan or
                            other charges of U.S. intervention will be met with positive U.S. denial
                            based on factual or notional plausibility; D. That in view of the
                            urgency and magnitude of the problem, early approval be granted to
                            implement Stage Two, Plan of Operations, including the organizational
                            concept and financial requirements.”</note></head>

                            Western Hemisphere Division reads: “(1) Attached is a copy of a letter
                            which was drafted by Second Secretary <persName>John C. Hill</persName>
                            and concurred in by Counselor of Embassy <persName>William L.
                                Krieg</persName> and First Secretary <persName>Andrew B.
                                Wardlaw</persName>. (2) A copy of this letter fell into the hands of
                            the writer, and I am taking steps to forward it, inasmuch as it is
                            possible that a copy thereof might not be received by Headquarters
                            through other channels. (3) The letter serves to indicate the attitude
                            of the three officers mentioned, and in view of the recommendations made
                            therein, they, of course, will be in a state of expectancy during the
                            coming months as to what is actually being done concerning this
                            situation. Events of the future will be interpreted by them in the light
                            of the recommendations made. (4) Unless Headquarters receives a copy of
                            this letter through Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJM1"
                                >Cabot</persName>, it is considered important from a point of view
                            of our local relationships with Embassy personnel that no one at
                            Headquarters give the slightest indication that Headquarters is
                            knowledgeable of the contents thereof.” A handwritten note in the margin

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName>Jack</persName>:</p>
                    <p>You will have seen my Secret Telegram No. 163 of December 23<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d79fn2">Printed in <ref target="frus1952-54v04#d21"><hi
                                    rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. IV, pp.
                                1093–1095 (Document 21)</ref>.</note> in which I recommended certain
                        policies which we believe would create a climate favorable for a change in
                        the Guatemalan Government. In this supplementary letter I want to round out
                        those recommendations by stressing the need for the U.S. Government to work
                        actively and quickly to assure that the Guatemalan Government is taken over
                        by elements willing and strong enough to eliminate Communist influence from
                        the Guatemalan political scene when the time comes. When the pressures
                        suggested in my telegram become effective here, the Communists as well as
                        the potential opposition to the regime may be expected to seek to exploit
                        the situation and we must then be as sure as possible that elements
                        favorable to our objectives are in the winning position.</p>
                    <p>As a result of my conversation with President <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1"
                            >Arbenz</persName> and general evaluation of the situation since my
                        arrival here two months ago I am fully convinced that continuance of his
                        administration until its term expires in 1957 will result in a further and
                        dangerous advance of Communism in this country, with all the attendant peril
                        to our security and economic interests in this area. It might well then be
                        too late to root it out without an internal clash of the type that occurred
                        in Greece and elsewhere. I believe further that the internal opposition to
                        the <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> regime is unlikely to act
                        independently <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0190"/>and that the U.S.
                        Government must accept the risks inherent in helping to bring about a change
                        of government here.</p>
                    <p>The principal problem now is selecting a force, which should if possible be a
                        Guatemalan force, capable of taking control of the government with our aid
                        and of besting the Communists in the troubled times which will almost
                        certainly surround any change–over. If a change is to be achieved in the
                        near future, the most promising organization which meets the requirements
                        for such a force is the Guatemalan Armed Forces, possibly acting in
                        conjunction with such exiled military and political figures and domestic
                        groups as will cooperate. The internal “anti–Communist” opposition now is
                        badly divided and without a workable political program or an organization
                        immediately available. It would, I believe, take many months of effort and
                        failures to get the “anti–Communist” factions together behind a plan with
                        any chance of success; there would be continual high risks of exposure; and
                        in any case it is doubtful whether even in the event that they win they
                        could stick together on a program which would satisfactorily reduce the
                        chances of a Communist–influenced counter–revolution.</p>
                    <p>I would therefore recommend that the Department select the Guatemalan Armed
                        Forces as the primary area in which any effort to stimulate anti-government
                        action is most likely to be fruitful. Though now loyal to this government
                        they are basically opportunistic. Efforts to win over key military personnel
                        must be done, as I know the Department is fully aware, so as to take the
                        minimum risk of exposing our hand, by using a judicious mixture of our
                        clandestine channels, our influence with neighboring anti–Communist
                        governments and our contacts with Guatemalan exile groups together with such
                        other contacts with the Military as we can maintain locally. It, of course,
                        will mean expenditure and some risk of charges of intervention which could
                        be serious if the matter is clumsily handled. But this risk must be accepted
                        or we must be prepared to abandon this field to Communism.</p>
                    <p>The approach to subverting the Armed Forces should of course be flexible and
                        we should attempt simultaneously to develop the other groups, such as
                        dissatisfied and opportunistic elements within the Administration and the
                        “anti-Communist” opposition. While our effort should be concentrated for
                        effectiveness on one group, we must be prepared to shift quickly if our
                        first approaches fail, and to work out combinations of forces if opportunity
                        offers. In this connection, military personnel with government connections
                        such as <persName corresp="#p_MCE1">Colonel Elfego Monzon</persName>,<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d79fn3">The name is underlined and a notation in the
                            margin reads “check.”</note> as well as the “anti-Communist” movement,
                        should be closely studied for any role they might usefully play.</p>
                    <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0191"/>
                    <p>The measures recommended in my telegram are intended to be closely
                        coordinated with the forging of a non-Communist force to take over here, for
                        of themselves they do not guarantee that a change favorable to us would
                        occur. What I expect is that the program outlined in the telegram would (a)
                        prepare hemispheric and Guatemalan opinion for a change and dull the charges
                        of intervention which may be expected to be leveled at us, and (b) to create
                        here a climate in which important segments of the population and especially
                        the Armed Forces and propertied class felt their interests sufficiently
                        threatened to be stirred from their present lethargy into a better
                        disposition to take the risks necessary to cooperate actively in bringing a
                        new government into power.</p>
                    <p>We must be as certain as possible, however, that a non-Communist force is
                        prepared to step in at the proper moment. The actual application of economic
                        sanctions would probably hit the propertied classes here harder and more
                        quickly than it would the government, and if long–drawn–out it might well
                        damage irreparably the propertied class and prevent it from retarding the
                        advance of Communism. The Communists, of course, could then be expected to
                        exploit the situation with confiscatory taxes and measures, economic
                        sabotage laws, etc., in order to complete the ruin of the conservative
                        segment that they have begun by their application of the Agrarian Reform
                        Law.</p>
                    <p>What I suggest, in short, has two complementary aspects: the measures to
                        create a climate favorable for a change recommended in my telegram, and
                        coordinated measures to win over and support a non-Communist force capable
                        of controlling the situation as urged in this letter. I see the risks of
                        exposure and recognize that the program would have to be carefully worked
                        out in Washington and here, for a misfired attempt to change the present
                        Guatemalan Government would most probably greatly strengthen the Communists
                        here and damage our standing everywhere if our part in a failure became
                        generally accepted. However, as I see it, Communism is slowly strangling
                        this country, and delay will only face us with a more difficult problem
                        later.</p>

                            regarding financial support due on 1 December for operations already

                            with a “power play” involving operational matters which were exclusively
                            subject to his, [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>],

                            Monzon</persName>, Minister without Portfolio, had told a group near
                        Brito, Department of Escuintla, that the time was not ripe for a move
                        against the Government, called at my office today and said that his friend,
                        who is also a close friend of <persName corresp="#p_MCE1">Monzon</persName>,
                        had had a three-hour talk with him and obtained the impression that
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCE1">Monzon</persName> thought conditions had to
                        become worse here before the Army would act against the <persName
                            corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> Government and that if a revolt were
                        attempted by opposition elements, the Government would bring thousands of
                        Indians into Guatemala City and that a massacre of white and middle class
                        elements would result.</p>
                    <p>According to the friend, he approached <persName corresp="#p_MCE1">Colonel
                            Monzon</persName> with an officer of substantial financial backing if
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCE1">Colonel Monzon</persName> would lead a
                        movement against the Government. <persName corresp="#p_MCE1"
                            >Monzon</persName> had replied by reiterating that the time was not ripe
                        but that he believed that in four or five months if things continued their
                        present course, the leaders of the Army would go to <persName
                            corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> and tell him he was “out.” The
                        friend had pressed <persName corresp="#p_MCE1">Monzon</persName> for his
                        view on what combination of circumstances would cause the Army officers to
                        act, and <persName corresp="#p_MCE1">Colonel Monzon</persName> had replied,
                        “Let us hope that there is a strong economic pressure on Guatemala.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCE1">Monzon</persName> had repeatedly emphasized
                        that the Army was anti-Communist and that it was deeply concerned over the
                        growth of Communist power.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the conversation <persName corresp="#p_MCE1">Colonel
                            Monzon</persName> had said he understood that Guatemalan exiles and
                        others were planning a revolt and that he feared it would result in a
                        tremendous amount of bloodshed. He had referred in this connection to the
                        fact that during the revolt which followed the assassination of Colonel
                            <persName>Arana</persName> in 1949, President
                            <persName>Arevalo</persName> had started to have thousands of Indians
                        from the Patzun-Patzicia area brought into the City; that <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCE1">Monzon</persName>, who was directing the Government
                        forces, had been able to stop this attempt, but that he believed the
                        Government would, if faced with a serious situation, resort to the same
                        device with possibly disastrous results which would leave a scar on the
                        Guatemalan body politic for years to come.</p>
                    <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0197"/>
                    <p>My informant’s friend was impressed by the circumstance that up to a year ago
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCE1">Colonel Monzon</persName> had been a stout
                        defender of the <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>
                        administration. Now he received the impression that <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCE1">Monzon</persName> would do nothing to save the
                        Government should it be threatened.</p>
                    <p>The informant went on to say that he had begun to reconsider his earlier
                        opposition to some sort of U.S. embargo on Guatemalan coffee in the light of
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCE1">Colonel Monzon</persName>’s remark about
                        economic pressure. As he did not think an Act of Congress or a voluntary
                        agreement among coffee importers feasible, he suggested that “red worms”
                        (gusanos rojos) might be found in Guatemalan coffee by the sanitary
                        inspectors. In reply to questions he said title to coffee passes to the U.S.
                        purchaser when coffee is delivered at a railroad station in Guatemala and
                        that the export tax ($8.00 per sack) became due when the coffee passed
                        through the Guatemalan port. Hence the initial impact of finding gusanos in
                        the coffee would fall on the U.S. purchaser rather than on the grower or the
                        Guatemalan Government. Eventually, of course, such measures would discourage
                        importers from buying Guatemalan coffee. If some way could be found to stop
                        buying Guatemalan Government coffee, this would be even more effective, but
                        neither of us could think of a practical way of doing this.</p>

                            element-of-surprise factors may well dictate a course which calls for
                            setting up Guatemala City inner organization to the point where if a
                            move is made by the Guatemala Central Command to move a partial force
                            toward Zacapa, Jutiapa, Puerto Barrios, or Coban or San Jose, the inner
                            organization would make its bid while partisan organization around
                            Guatemala City retarded, harassed and generally set up the partial force
                            for annihilation by the Zacapa, Jutiapa, Puerto Barrios, Coban, and San
                            Jose forces. The idea of being capable of taking over if Guatemala City
                            forces are depleted can be promoted to the point where the Guatemala
                            City Command will be detained, at least partially. <gloss

                        <item>Contingency plans should account for 1. employment of Guatemala forces
                            to the aid of our initial targets (which contingency has been generally
                            considered in the above paragraphs). 2. Retirement of Guatemalan forces
                            to Quezaltenango as has been reported to be the Guatemalan plan. In this
                            latter event it is now being considered most feasible to complete the
                            capitulation of Guatemala City set up against returned activities from
                            the Quezaltenango area and complete solid reorganization before turning
                            to the Quezaltenango problem. After solid organization it would be
                            considered within our capabilities to take the forces at Quezaltenango
                            by straight attack. 3. Another contingency would be for Guatemala City
                            to prepare for a state of siege in which case reorganization following
                            seizure of the initial targets could be carried out while insuring
                            isolation of Guatemala City from re-supply or reinforcement.</item>

                            Kubes</persName> who is a next-door neighbor of <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCE1">Colonel Elfego Monzon</persName> that the Colonel
                        seems to be prepared psychologically for joining the opposition. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCE1">Colonel Monzon</persName> reportedly stated that he
                        had 300 officers on his side, but my informant did not know whether this
                        meant they were merely well disposed towards <persName corresp="#p_MCE1"
                            >Monzon</persName> or actually had come to some sort of understanding
                        with him. <persName corresp="#p_MCE1">Colonel Monzon</persName> is quoted as
                        having stated that it would be too bad to have the uprising occur just at
                        this time when things were not quite ready.</p>
                    <p>A few days ago <persName corresp="#p_MCE1">Colonel Monzon</persName> was
                        shocked to learn that the Guardia Civil had recently received 500
                        sub-machine guns from Belgium and he was particularly annoyed that despite
                        his position in the Guatemalan Army this delivery had been effected without
                        his having been informed. He arranged to inspect one of these guns and
                        reported it to be a very fine weapon. The guns fire clips of 30 cartridges.
                        He is reported to have said that the delivery of these guns to the police
                        was an affront to the Army.</p>
                    <p>My informant was of the opinion that the police are now better equipped for
                        fighting inside the city than is the Army. Supporting his view that the
                        Army’s weapons are in a very poor state, he remarked that an individual by
                        the name of <persName>Julio Gaitan</persName>, whom he knows slightly, told
                        him that he had recently visited the barracks at Guardia de Honor where he
                        observed 150 soldiers working away at rifle cartridges with files. He asked
                        an officer what the soldiers were doing and was informed that they were
                        filing down Czech cartridges which did not quite fit the 7 mm. rifles used
                        by the Guatemalan Army. My informant took this as evidence that the
                        Guatemalan Army is suffering a desperate shortage of ammunition.</p>
                    <p>My informant also reported that it is said by many people in Guatemala that
                        the opposition has a large store of arms in Ahuachapan, El Salvador, which
                        is not far from the Guatemalan border. He had no further information on
                        this.</p>

                    <p>I am convinced of the reliability of my informant but I have no opinion about
                        the reliability of <persName>Kubes</persName> or
                        <persName>Gaitan</persName>.</p>

                                <persName>Mylkes</persName> began discussion of PP organization as

                            organizations in the field. A general picture was developed as to how
                            the PP program fitted into the overall picture and how important it was.
                            At <persName corresp="#p_GOG1">Galbond</persName>’s advice, particular
                            stress was laid <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0206"/>on how the
                            military could be defected or neutralized. The current installations and

                        <item>This conversation (para 2) brought up subject of security.
                                <persName>Mylkes</persName> indicated that he was personally certain
                            that the group would want to study all of the security considerations
                            before continuing as scheduled. He advised that on two previous efforts
                            the <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss>-[<hi rend="italic">name not
                                declassified</hi>] group had been compromised at last moment,
                            causing long delay and costly re-financing. For this reason
                                <persName>Mylkes</persName> stated that it was his <hi rend="italic"
                                >Personal</hi> opinion that <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss>
                            be prepared to either explain the fact with the info that his group had

                            of security and FI practices were not adequate. <gloss
                                target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> defended his position strongly by
                            saying that his men should not be judged too severely and that he,
                            personally, was responsible since he could not establish such a system
                            of checks and investigations with his sensitive Latin assistants.</item>

                        <item>Later the same day (30 Jan.), <persName>Mylkes</persName> returned to
                            the house and the matter of security was again brought up. At this point
                                <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss>, without any prompting,
                            advised that he had learned now that <persName>Delgado</persName> had
                            betrayed him and that he was willing to accept the ideas of the group
                            re: security and FI <gloss target="#t_ops1">Ops</gloss>.
                                <persName>Mylkes</persName> pointed out that although <gloss

                            responsibility he would receive the benefits of better <pb n="177"
                                xml:id="pg_177" facs="0207"/>intelligence and security. He agreed
                            and said that immediately upon his return he would issue a general order
                            which would necessitate compliance with all measures deemed necessary by
                            our FI officer. He said that all of those sensitive people would have to
                            accept a general law which arose as a result of this
                                <persName>Delgado</persName> betrayal or be removed to less
                            sensitive jobs out of his general Headquarters. <gloss

                                xml:id="d89fn3">According to a January 30 <hi rend="italic">New York
                                    Times</hi> article found in Central Intelligence Agency files,
                                the Guatemalan Government charged in a “White Paper” that it had
                                learned of a heavily-financed plot involving Nicaraguan President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SGA1">Somoza</persName> plus the
                                Governments of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela to
                                overthrow the <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> regime.
                                “In an apparent allusion to the United States, Guatemala listed the
                                ’Government of the North” among those it accused of endorsing the
                                plot. The Government charged further that the United Fruit Company,
                                a United States-owned concern with large banana plantation holdings
                                in Guatemala, had supplied arms to the plotters.” According to the
                                article, the claims were backed by “photostatic copies of
                                correspondence,” although the Department of State refused to
                                “dignify” the charges. A spokesman said “that the charges were ’in
                                line with the usual Communist chars against the United States.’”

                    <p>4. Consider seriously the advisability of withdrawing <gloss

                    <p>297. 1. Following views are presented for HQS consideration:</p>
                    <p>A. White Paper<note n="2" xml:id="d91fn2">Handwritten marginal note:
                            “[illegible]—’White paper’ only thing to be carded.”</note> has
                        effectively exposed certain aspects of <gloss target="#t_PBSPBSUCCESS1"
                            >PBSUCCESS</gloss>, probably more to come. Stage One report clearly
                        recognized this possibility (cover page and page 2). Stage Two was
                        implemented to explore and probe potential assets, testing while
                            developing.<note n="3" xml:id="d91fn3">Handwritten marginal note: “quite
                            agree.” The Stage One report is <ref target="#d62">Document
                            62</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>2. Aside from KUHOOK camps and limited <gloss target="#t_KUFIRE1"
                            >KUFIRE</gloss> progress, other operations not even implemented to date.
                        Assessment thus far has been favorable to good.<note n="4" xml:id="d91fn4"
                            >Handwritten marginal note: “Question fair to good aspect of
                            assessment.”</note> Losses sustained by arrests and exposé not believed
                        irreparable providing no lessening in determination develops.</p>
                    <p>C. Believe remaining assets will deteriorate rapidly if any doubts or
                        evidence of abandonment permitted, thus effectively destroying what appears
                        to be only known substance to resistance.<note n="5" xml:id="d91fn5"
                            >Handwritten marginal note: “fluff.”</note> Our pressure, once applied,
                        should not be released but intensified. Nothing is more demoralizing than
                        on–again, off–again.</p>
                    <p>2. Current situation however requires careful consideration. The enemy has
                        played a strong card which we must be prepared to counter and exploit or
                        withdraw.</p>

                                >PBSUCCESS</gloss> enters the para-military phase, or begins the
                            utilization of agent type communications to service intelligence nets,
                            there will be a requirement for a small semi-clandestine radio station
                            to handle these communications.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>There are two major reasons why <gloss target="#t_KUBARK1"
                                >KUBARK</gloss> should establish and operate such a radio station
                            rather than support a station to be handled by <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJH1">Calligeris</persName>. By controlling and
                            operating the base radio station, <gloss target="#t_KUBARK1"
                                >KUBARK</gloss> has control of <gloss target="#t_PBSPBSUCCESS1"
                                >PBSUCCESS</gloss> tactical communications and thus maintains
                            control over the operation itself. The second major reason is that the
                            operation of such a semi-clandestine radio base is a specialized skill
                            not available except through <gloss target="#t_KUCLUB1">KUCLUB</gloss>.
                            There is not sufficient time available to train <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJH1">Calligeris</persName>’ men to handle base station
                            communications.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Technically the existing <gloss target="#t_KUCLUB1">KUCLUB</gloss>
                            radio station in [<hi rend="italic">place not declassified</hi>] could
                            be utilized for this operation. However, communications originating in
                                <gloss target="#t_WSBURNT1">WSBURNT</gloss> during the para-military
                            phase and traceable as working into a U.S. Government radio station
                            prohibits the use of this station.</item>

                        <item>The <gloss target="#t_SHERWOOD1">Sherwood</gloss> installation and the

                            the most economical use of communications personnel available. The
                            strong possibility that <gloss target="#t_SHERWOOD1">Sherwood</gloss>
                            could be compromised and lost before the para-military is entered into
                            must be considered, thus making it unwise to combine the two

                        <item>On 9 February 1954 I advised [<hi rend="italic">name not
                                declassified</hi>] that within a very short time the Group would
                            need a very concise report on his political platform; we would need
                            this, I explained, to help summarize our future propaganda activities
                            (which I restated for him). I advised [<hi rend="italic">name not
                                declassified</hi>] to put himself in the position of an individual
                            facing a group of newspapermen who could within 10 or 15 minutes briefly
                            outline his political program. He said that he would be very happy to do
                            so and immediately started to prepare this report; after working on this
                            matter for one day, he said that he was almost finished. In addition to
                            writing the general points, [<hi rend="italic">name not
                                declassified</hi>] said that he was attempting when possible to put
                            on a separate paper the specific steps of his program which would fall
                            under each general heading; this, he said, would be extremely necessary
                            in order to make our propaganda campaign more effective.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>We developed the discussion of how [<hi rend="italic">name not
                                declassified</hi>] would implement this political program,
                            discussing the great difficulties of re-orienting certain political
                            trends in his country. At this point [<hi rend="italic">name not
                                declassified</hi>] made the following observation: “If the Group
                            gives me freedom of administration—” I immediately assured him that
                            there would be no interference by the Group in Guatemalan administrative
                            affairs once his Junta in power. He continued, “Well, if that is true,
                            and if <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">Rufus</gloss> provides me with the
                            sufficient military security which he has indicated, then I will provide
                            him with a sufficient strong administration.” He added, “You will see

                            army to enable him to secure liberty of action. He said, “Ah yes, I have
                            not forgotten that. I hope that if plans progress it will be possible to
                            have the army neutralized in a certain form so that certain elements

                            into a successful dual military-political operation for his new

                            further indicated clearly that with circumstances as they are today,
                            government of and by the people of Guatemala would be virtually
                            impossible, that as he saw it his new government had certain long range
                            targets and certain short range targets. He implied that absolutely free
                            elections and other such lofty principles as greatly expanded
                            educational facilities and certain technical advances would certainly be
                            the long range type of planning. Specifically, the agrarian reform issue
                            would fall into this category.</item>

                        <item>Speaking on the agrarian reform issue, [<hi rend="italic">name not
                                declassified</hi>] indicated that he hoped to achieve an equitable
                            set-up where ever possible. I asked him at this point what would be his
                            position with regard to the demands of United Fruit and how he would
                            handle their obvious claims for repayment of the land which had been
                            taken from them. While there was no direct statement on this point by
                                [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>], the inference was
                            that that which had already been taken from United Fruit would be almost
                            impossible to return and his solution would be the possibility of
                            opening up to them new tracks of land and making available other land
                            enterprises which had heretofore been denied them. The possibility of
                            offering United Fruit other undeveloped lands for their technical
                            exploitation would constitute [<hi rend="italic">name not

                            with some of the political ideas which he has espoused. However I stated
                            that while the ideas which he would give me would be carefully

                                    declassified</hi>] handed to [<hi rend="italic">name not

                                have been passed by the Chief of Station, [<hi rend="italic">place

                                    declassified</hi>] left these messages in the apartment when he
                                left the country. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]
                                further stated that because of the apparent importance of the
                                information contained in the messages, he had made said messages
                                immediately available to his good friend, President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SGA1">Somoza</persName>. When [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >name not declassified</hi>] examined the messages in question,
                                he immediately realized that a serious exposure of Agency cryptonyms
                                and <gloss target="#t_PBSPBSUCCESS1">PBSUCCESS</gloss>
                                organizational methods and procedures had been revealed to at least

                                persons and probably an indeterminable number of others. He
                                immediately cabled Station <persName>LINCOLN</persName> advising
                                them of the compromise in general terms and indicated that he was
                                departing for <persName>LINCOLN</persName> immediately with the
                                documents in question.</item>

                            <item>Station <persName>LINCOLN</persName> alerted headquarters at 1300
                                hours, 19 February 1954, by telephone and advised that a courier
                                would arrive at headquarters at 2200 hours, 19 February 1954, with
                                the compromised documents. <persName>LINCOLN</persName> followed the
                                telephone call with cable 612 which indicated that fact that the
                                compromise consisted of 5 pages of slightly paraphrased text
                                containing all basic cryptonyms and pseudonyms applying not only to
                                    <gloss target="#t_PBSPBSUCCESS1">PBSUCCESS</gloss> but to the
                                Agency at large. The <gloss target="#t_PBSPBSUCCESS1"
                                    >PBSUCCESS</gloss> desk made a preliminary examination upon
                                receipt of cable 612<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">Not found.</note>
                                and determined that the compromise involved roughly six cables. It
                                was not possible at that time, however, to determine exactly which
                                cryptonyms had been exposed. When the courier arrived with the
                                compromised messages, Mr. [<hi rend="italic">name not
                                    declassified</hi>] of Commo was called and he and Mr. <persName

                            <item>That a definite possibility exists that the information contained

                                apparently intentionally withheld from the Agency information of
                                what was known to him to constitute a major breach of security
                                directly affecting the security of the project and the security of
                                the Agency. The fact that this was known to him is clearly indicated
                                by his having arranged, while in Washington, without notifying the

                        <item>In accordance with instructions which I had received, I went over in

                                <persName>Don Pedro</persName>. [<hi rend="italic">name not
                                declassified</hi>] attitude was completely negative. Even before I
                            had finished the complete discussion of the points contained in the
                            memorandum, he had attempted to interrupt me with strong objections. The
                            complete list of objections is to be found in attached memorandum
                                typewritten.<note n="3" xml:id="d104fn3">Not printed. In part, [<hi

                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The most outstanding thing which I gathered from this discussion was
                                [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] intense dislike of
                                <persName>Don Pedro</persName>, and any possible collaboration with
                            him on the part of the Junta or the Group to him appeared as a grave
                            error. He summarized this attitude in stating that even if we discover
                            that it is necessary to place <persName>Don Pedro</persName> in a
                            position of use—that is to secure his help in having San Salvador as a
                            base of operations, or in some manner to assist us in that
                            country—whatever <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0231"/>small part he
                            plays will not be worth the trouble which will be created later on by
                            incorporating him into the movement. He pointed out that, in weighing
                            this, it would be his opinion, and he was certain that <gloss
                                target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> would share this opinion, that no
                            use could be made of <persName>Don Pedro</persName>.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>I then explained several points which had been made in the initial
                            discussion, of the written memorandum which had been given to me.
                            However, [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] did not give in
                            an inch and appeared to be adamant regarding the matter of doing any
                            business at all with <persName>Don Pedro</persName>.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>I advised him that, of course, they would be kept in constant
                            knowledge of what was taking place with <persName>Don Pedro</persName>,
                            and furthermore, the results of the conversations which might
                            ensue.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>At this time I returned to the Base and, after conveying the initial
                            reaction of [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] to
                                Jerry,<note n="4" xml:id="d104fn4">Not further identified.</note> I
                            was advised that possibly this attitude should be changed slightly to
                            the one that it would be possible to utilize him after his true assets
                            had been obtained and reviewed by <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1"
                                >RUFUS</gloss> and [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>],
                            an isolation process would have to take place; that I should advise [<hi
                                rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] definitely that this
                            consideration certainly would be thought of, if his assets did not
                            appear actually to be real. I advised Jerry that I had not brought this
                            matter up because it had not been in the memorandum, although Jerry
                            advised me such information had been contained in the FT Task. I, in
                            brief, outlined the information and reaction and objections of [<hi
                                rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] to him and then advised
                            him that I would return with this additional information for [<hi
                                rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] benefit. Also, I advised
                            that I wished to clarify the matter regarding Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGWBS1">Smith</persName>’s obtaining an approval of
                            approach to <persName>Pedro</persName>, and as to what reaction there
                            had been at the time.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Checking again with [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] a
                            short bit later, I advised him that I had been thinking about this
                            matter while I had been gone and that I was extremely interested in
                            finding out further his reaction on this thing. [<hi rend="italic">name
                                not declassified</hi>] said that he principally had absolutely no
                            confidence in <persName>Don Pedro</persName> and that <gloss
                                target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> shared this view also. I then
                            advised [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] that, actually,
                            if we discovered that no real assets or real use could be made of
                                <persName>Don Pedro</persName>, certainly we wished to get him out
                            of the way, either by neutralization, isolation, or, at last risk or
                            cost, elimination. I said we could not allow this man to continue in his
                            present state, in as much as he was actually <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202"
                                facs="0232"/>doing harm to the Junta, and that we must find some way
                            to fit him in or take him out of the picture.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] again stated his views
                            as to the risks of taking him in and gave to me at this time a list of
                            objections which he had verbally told me earlier in the afternoon. He
                            again counselled extreme caution on any dealings with <persName>Don
                                Pedro</persName>, stating that, at any time and at any place,
                                <persName>Don Pedro</persName> would be willing to betray anyone for
                            his own personal interests. I advised him that the utmost discretion
                            would be used and that immediately after we had obtained from
                                <persName>Pedro</persName> a list of his assets, we would make these
                            facts known to <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> and [<hi
                                rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>], for their private
                            investigation or survey of them.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>I asked [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] if this whole
                            subject of <persName>Pedro</persName> had not been approached previously
                            by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGWBS1">Smith</persName>, and [<hi
                                rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] had advised that it had
                            been and that <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> said that if the
                            Group dictated that <persName>Pedro</persName> should be the leader of
                            this, if it meant success for the movement, he, <gloss
                                target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss>, would become a soldier in the
                            ranks to comply. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] said if
                            this eventuation should come to pass, he, although he would continue
                            along with the movement, would be the first one to oppose him once he
                            was established as the new leader of Guatemala.</item>

                            target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss>’ lack of cooperation with
                            <persName>Andres</persName>. <persName>Andres</persName> has been able
                        to see <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> but once since 4 February and
                        then only for a short period of time.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> must co-operate fully, remembering
                        that <persName>Andres</persName> is the Group’s representative in the field.
                        In order for the Group and [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] to
                        keep informed on what is going on, it is imperative for <gloss
                            target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> to keep <persName>Andres</persName>
                        fully informed so that he in turn can notify [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] and the Group, of any and all new developments.</p>
                    <p>The Group and [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] will not be able
                        to coordinate any aspect of the operation if <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1"
                            >RUFUS</gloss> is acting on his own without notifying [<hi rend="italic"
                            >name not declassified</hi>] and the Group.</p>
                    <p>Only this week <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> sent sensitive
                        material to [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] via his own
                        courier. This is exactly one of the things security-wise the Group is trying
                        to correct. Three failures in the past were probably <pb n="206"
                            xml:id="pg_206" facs="0236"/>caused by insecure methods of operation,
                        and definitely the recent “White Paper” was the result of an insecure
                        courier.</p>
                    <p>If the Group is going to continue lending aid to the Junta, the Group will
                        definitely not permit what has caused failure in the past to continue in the
                        future. The Group wants to aid the operation but does not want to see it
                        fail again because of the same old reasons of insecure means of operation
                        and lack of coordination between the Junta and the Group.</p>
                    <p>The Group realizes that <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> has a
                        tremendous job and is extremely busy, but he can never allow himself to be
                        so busy as to be insecure and not to keep [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] and the Group, who are trying to help him, and
                        supporting him, fully informed of all his actions and developments in the
                        field. Because <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> is so busy, it is
                        impossible for him to devote necessary time to details; and that is exactly
                        where <persName>Andres</persName>, [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] and the Group can help him and advise him, provided
                        they are kept fully informed.</p>

                            Wisconsin. We drove for about an hour out River Road and I am certain

                            for the compromise of the five paraphrased cables, and in a manner which
                            appeared to be entirely sincere. I asked him how it was possible, with
                            all of the security indoctrination which he had had, plus the great
                            emphasis on secrecy based on all phases of <gloss

                            unpardonable thing as to leave sensitive papers in a hotel room. He
                            replied that he had no explanation, that it was a stupid, unpardonable
                            thing to do, but that it was an act of thoughtlessness and carelessness.
                            He expressed himself as <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0237"/>most
                            concerned over the effects on the operation and the OAS Conference.<note

                        <item>I told <persName corresp="#p_SJR1">Seekford</persName> that while it
                            was impossible to undo the past, it was his obligation and duty to
                            remain under [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] for a long while to come. He said that he
                            realized how important this was during the OAS Conference. I told him it
                            was equally important for a much longer period, because the enemy might
                            time their disclosures to coincide with expected paramilitary action on
                            our part, and that this might be many months in the future. To this he
                            agreed.</item>

                        <item>It was agreed that for the next month <persName corresp="#p_SJR1"
                                >Seekford</persName> will remain in Chicago. We discussed two
                            general areas where he could bury himself after that date—Alaska and the
                            Pacific Northwest. While he is willing to go to Alaska, he prefers the
                            Northwest [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>]. He has never been in the Northwest and suggested
                            as a possibility that he get a job until Fall as a fire watcher on a
                            mountain top where he would meet very few people. Another possibility
                            would be to get him a job as an engineer on one of the many construction
                            projects that must be under way in that region. He believes that the
                            Northwest would be more secure than Alaska, [<hi rend="italic">2 lines

                        <item>It is my firm opinion, based upon everything I have read to date upon
                            agrarian reform, that it is imperative we examine this matter closely
                            and be prepared to accept it as originally conceived as part of our
                            political program. I believe it is essential that we do so and that the
                            gains so made and the progress under this reform not be lost while
                            changing governments. If we are able to adopt this quickly in our
                            program and propagate rapidly, it is believed that we will obtain
                            considerable support from the campesinos wherein lies the strength of
                            the enemy. In this regard we would then be able to provide for support
                            within the <gloss target="#t_CNC1">CNC</gloss>, attempting to subsidize
                            and defect this organization as much as possible.</item>

                        <item>As a corollary to the above effort I believe we should concentrate
                            soonest on mounting an operation to defect <persName corresp="#p_MMA1"
                                >Major Martinez</persName>, assuring him that the agrarian reform
                            would be fully accepted by the new government and that he would be the
                            director to insure that it is properly carried out in the best interests
                            of the people. This could be a very important defection target and, if
                            successful, could largely contribute to our ultimate success.</item>

                            with comments on a paper entitled “Points for consideration concerning
                            informant”. It was agreed that the identity of Mr. X, who is in contact
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRG1">Leddy</persName>, should not be
                            disclosed at this time except on a strictly need-to-know basis. Mr. [<hi
                                rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] said that this contact
                            fell in a vague and shadowy field where it is not clear when does such a
                            case come into the zone of being a Bureau matter. Mr. [<hi rend="italic"
                                >name not declassified</hi>] suggested getting in touch with Mr.
                                <persName>Dennis Flinn</persName>, Deputy Director for Security of
                            the Department of State because X comes from a hostile Embassy and has
                            begun to talk. It is suggested that the Bureau be notified of this
                            development for the protection of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRG1"
                                >Leddy</persName> and in order to prevent them from wasting time
                            running after false scents. If by any chance the Bureau has a case, the
                            Department of State would not want to cross wires. It is our hope that
                            the Bureau would not wish to assert total jurisdiction. Information
                            received from informant X is extremely interesting. Details are covered
                            in memorandum referred to. [<hi rend="italic">3-1/2 lines of source text

                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRG1">Leddy</persName> were there to take
                            stock of the present situation, to determine where we stand now and what
                            are the future prospects. Are things going downhill so fast in Guatemala
                            that <gloss target="#t_PBSPBSUCCESS1">PBSUCCESS</gloss> as it now stands
                            may not be enough. Consideration must be given to the much greater
                            pressure which may come from Congress and public opinion on the present
                            Administration if the situation in Guatemala does deteriorate. It may be
                            necessary to take more calculated risks then before. At the end of the
                            Caracas Conference we should have a clearer view of our position and a
                            re-assessment of the situation should be made at a briefing and

                            We agree to the need of making progress reports to policy chiefs of this
                            Government so that we may obtain additional reassurances that the rug
                            will not be pulled from under us in the future as occurred in the Li Mi
                            case. Mr. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] then asked Mr.

                                >Leddy</persName> replied: (a) We might reconsider exploiting the
                            conclusion arrived at by <persName corresp="#p_TMRL1"
                                >Trujillo</persName> last year and transmitted to <persName>Perez
                                Jimenez</persName> that the best way to bring about the fall of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> government would be to
                            eliminate 15-20 of its leaders with <persName corresp="#p_TMRL1"
                                >Trujillo</persName>’s trained pistoleros. (b) State might consider
                            overt action along the lines of no more shipping to Guatemala, no more
                            oil, no more air passengers or transport. (c) <gloss
                                target="#t_PBSPBSUCCESS1">PBSUCCESS</gloss> program through Phase IV
                            appears insufficient to do the job and it is feared that Phase V shows
                            the U.S. hand. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLJ1">Berry</persName> then
                            said that in his opinion the “gut point” of the operation is where does
                            the Guatemala City garrison stand, and asked [<hi rend="italic">name not
                                declassified</hi>] if he could answer that question. [<hi
                                rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] replied that he thought
                            the operation could be brought to a conclusion by 15 June; that the
                            program was complex but that we believe the Agency has the capability of
                            doing the job. The radio program is to begin on 1 April and the last
                            part of it, at D-Day, a terror program, is based on Orson Welles and is
                            most effective. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]—the
                            build-up by training, equipment, etc.—is like a boiler under steam
                            pressure; it cannot be stopped once it gets to a certain point. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLJ1">Berry</persName> repeated that the
                            important question is where does the Guatemala City garrison stand, and

                                target="#t_PBSPBSUCCESS1">PBSUCCESS</gloss> is a complex, top secret
                            program which includes ghost voicing, deception, mines, bazookas, and
                            fire power. It is difficult to explain without the wall map and charts
                            available at <persName>LINCOLN</persName>. There remains a lot to be
                            done but it is believed it can be done by June. While it is fine to talk
                            about the OAS Conference and the need for a re-assessment of its
                            conclusion, once we get beyond a certain point we do not believe that we
                            can stop the operation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLJ1"

                            target="#t_PBSPBSUCCESS1">PBSUCCESS</gloss> from the viewpoint of the
                        Department. We need a general go-around with consideration being given to

                        be done. High level State thinking is that an act which can be pinned on the
                        United States will set us back in our relations with Latin American
                        countries by fifty years.”</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] then expressed himself as
                        opposed to the elimination of 15–20 Guatemalan leaders as a possible
                        solution to the problem, although stating that such elimination was part of
                        the plan and could be done. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLJ1">Berry</persName>
                        then said that knocking off the leaders might make it possible for the Army
                        to take over. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] replied that it
                        is an illusion to believe the Army has control. The Army is losing control
                        to organized and armed labor and police. The 1952 revolution in Bolivia
                        could be repeated, where for the first time in Latin American history armed
                        labor defeated the Army. Mr. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]
                        stated that it is not certain that the Army has lost control. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LRG1">Leddy</persName> said that he was much surprised at
                            [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]’s statement about the
                        armed strength of labor because according to an Embassy report of two weeks
                        ago there is no known training of labor groups and it must be that the
                        Embassy needs jacking up in its reporting. [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] said that our information came via <gloss
                            target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss>’ nets and was a third country
                        operation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRG1">Leddy</persName> then asked is it
                        feasible to buy up the top Army command. [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] replied he did not know but we are prepared to launch
                        an operation towards the defection and recruitment of [<hi rend="italic"

                        and [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] and possibly <persName

                            >Leddy</persName> replied this merits going into, but in his opinion the
                        chances of defecting <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> are much
                        less than 50–50. A discussion followed of using [<hi rend="italic">less than

                                >Berry</hi></persName> raised the question what would happen to

                            >Arbenz</persName> was overthrown. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRG1"
                            >Leddy</persName> said he opposed [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of

                            rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. He
                        reiterated—“When we get to the point of making a decision where our action
                        will successfully attribute to the United States Government the support of a
                        revolution, it is our thinking at this time that we should not get on with
                        it.” He asked—“Is it possible to provoke an incident where OAS will
                        intervene?”</p>

                            >See <ref target="#d113">Document 113</ref>.</note> He stated that the

                            >PBSUCCESS</gloss> and that a statement was made in official language at

                        would not under any circumstances support <gloss target="#t_PBSPBSUCCESS1"
                            >PBSUCCESS</gloss> if it meant that the U.S. government would become
                        involved in any way; that the State Dept. was not willing to sacrifice its
                        principles of non-intervention for the Guatemalan cause. [<hi rend="italic"
                            >initials not declassified</hi>] said he insisted that it be read in the
                        record that the statement be qualified that the U.S. government would not be
                        involved beyond notional or plausible denial. [<hi rend="italic">name not

                        toward the problem since it was laid on by NSC. He said that we made no
                        commitments that the U.S. could not be pulled out of and if we do pull out
                        now we lose face among the anti-Communists and we would never be able to
                        mount an operation of this kind in Guatemala again. [<hi rend="italic">name
                            not declassified</hi>] stated that in approximately 10 days the
                        situation would be such that whereas we may desire to pull out, it would not
                        alter the course of events; we could not pull out. In 10 days the movement
                        would be beyond recall.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] was asked if we felt that we

                        surprised.</p>
                    <p>He insisted that he had to have a vote of confidence, that there would be no

                                sounding board for propaganda. The danger of producing confusion is
                                realized. This is a request for study, not an instruction to set up

                                recuperating from the rigors of idleness. His standing will be
                                backed by a New York investment counselor, Mr. [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >name not declassified</hi>] notionally entrusted with the
                                administration of Page’s account. In Page’s name Mr. [<hi
                                    rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] will open a checking
                                account with the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text

                                perfunctory checks, but is unlikely to stand up to severe scrutiny.
                                It may lend surface credence to Page’s disassociation from any
                                official connection with the United States Govt.</p></item>

                                that the United States Govt. does not disapprove of the underlying
                                purpose of this program and that, even without official cognizance,
                                all commitments will be met. Where success or failure of the whole

                                backing, the circumstances will be presented to higher headquarters
                                for their decision. In a case of overriding importance, the
                                legitimization of Page should require official backstopping, and
                                since time is of the essence, Page will be authorized to attempt at
                                resolving the issue locally in consultation with Ambassador

                                This, however, should not be taken for granted and their resort to

                            concerning the shipment and its time and method of delivery, including
                            the identification of the vessel or other means of transport, no other
                            action of any kind should be taken. If we are able to pin this one down
                            and develop intelligence concerning the shipment, there are a number of
                            means of exploitation which will have to be considered at a very high
                            policy level, and the possibility exists that strong measures may be
                            taken.</item>

                        <item>It is our current thinking that we should take no action at this stage
                            to deter or interfere with the shipment, but rather allow events to take
                            their course at least to the point when exposure would be most

                        <item>In a conversation with Admiral <persName>Espe</persName> yesterday
                            afternoon, I called his attention to this matter and underscored its
                            importance. I proposed to him and he agreed to an “intelligence
                            partnership” with regard to this shipment. More specifically, I
                            suggested that we keep each other fully informed of whatever might come
                            to our attention respectively about the shipment and that our joint
                            resources be concentrated upon the obtainment—through secret means—of
                            all possible information about it. I have recommended to [<hi

                            opening conversation with Admiral <persName>Espe</persName> or his
                            Deputy, and I think that it is important that this be done at an early
                            date. In this follow-up [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]
                            should emphasize the importance of avoiding any showing of our (US)
                            knowledge or interest so as to avoid a premature flushing of the

                        <item>Both State and this Agency would be immediately faced with the $64
                            question: “What are we going to do about Guatemala, and what can we do
                            that would be effective?” We are on notice of the fact that in the upper
                            echelons of the Administration it is expected that something will be
                            done—of a drastic nature—to remove the menace of Communist-controlled
                            Guatemala. Moreover, there seems to exist a considerable degree of
                            expectation in certain quarters of the Congress that something is
                            brewing, and in any case, that something must be done. These are real
                            factors in the problem which must be taken seriously into account. There
                            is also the question of public opinion, with noticeable indications of a
                            rising feeling of concern about Guatemala and the ever-present
                            possibility that this will crystallize in terms of a demand for action.
                            The significance of this last point is not that it is or would become a
                            partisan political issue domestically, but rather that an accumulation
                            of pressures of the kind referred to could have the effect of forcing
                            action on a too-hasty basis and possibly with fewer assets than are
                            believed to be available at present. Any action taken after a public
                            clamor would be much more demonstrably attributable to us than action
                            taken prior to such public debate and demand.</item>

                            entirely possible that governments in addition to that of Guatemala’s

                            is, of course, not vital inasmuch as our people are professionals and
                            are supposed to take their orders in good part and carry them out
                            conscientiously. However, there would be an inevitable, intangible loss
                            of heart and taste for an attempted subsequent resumption of an
                            operation of this character, and this would be understandable</item>

                    <p>The foregoing points are not submitted by way of argumentation. They simply
                        represent our best efforts to outline the principal deterrents and
                        difficulties which would result from a decision to jettison the operation at
                        the present time. Some, if not most, of these difficulties and detriments
                        would tend to be the greater as we proceed further into the operation and
                        become even more engaged than we now are.</p>

                    <p rend="center">COMMUNISM IN CENTRAL AMERICA</p>
                    <p>The Communist movement in Guatemala and Central America is part of the world
                        movement of Communist Parties. All Communist Parties, acting under the
                        direction of the Soviet Union, follow the same general pattern in seeking to
                        capture free social institutions and democratic governments. Some operate
                        openly and others clandestinely, but all are integral parts of the world
                        wide Communist effort. Communism as an ideology, in Guatemala as in other
                        countries, is only a creed for a small militant and power-hungry group.
                        Communist successes are largely the result of an effective use of
                        operational techniques designed to effect the greatest possible degree of
                        control over the most important elements of the local political
                        structure.</p>
                    <p>In Guatemala these elements are infiltrated at top levels by Communists with
                        the result that the government and economy are effectively controlled by the
                        Party. President <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Jacobo Arbenz</persName> and
                        other prominent government and military officials are not members of the
                        Communist Party. However, <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> has
                        used the Communists to further his own political ambitions, and to a great
                        extent he is now dependent upon them for the support which he needs to stay
                        in power. For all practical purposes he and his chief aides follow the
                        Communist line in their speeches and actions, and they have relied in an
                        increasing measure upon the advice of Communist leaders. The latter
                        constitute the real government of Guatemala in the sense that they have a
                        decisive influence <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0270"/>on all important
                        moves, either directly through government officials or through pressure
                        tactics on the part of controlled organizations. As long as the Army, few
                        officials of which are under Communist influence, continues to support
                            <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>, it is likely that
                        Communist power will grow.</p>
                    <p>The most influential Communists and pro-Communists in Guatemala at the
                        present time are the following:</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_FJM1">Jose Manuel Fortuny</persName></p>
                    <p>Secretary General of the Communist Guatemalan Labor Party (PGT).</p>

                    <p>Secretary of Disputes of the General Confederation of Guatemalan Workers

                    <p><persName>Augusto Charnaud MacDonald</persName></p>
                    <p>Secretary General of the Party of the Guatemalan Revolution (PRG). Minister

                    <p><persName>Victor Manuel Gutierrez</persName></p>

                    <p>Secretary General of the Party of Revolutionary Action (PAR). Deputy National

                    <p><persName>Dora Franco y Franco</persName></p>
                    <p>Secretary General of Alliance of Guatemalan Women (AFG).</p>
                    <p><persName>Humberto Alvarado</persName></p>
                    <p>Head of PGT Youth Commission which controls AJDG.</p>
                    <p><persName>Cesar Augusto Cazali Avila</persName></p>
                    <p>Secretary General of Democratic University Front (FUD).</p>
                    <p><persName>Waldemar Barrios Klee</persName></p>
                    <p>Chief of Lands Section of National Agrarian Department and Assistant to
                        Director.</p>
                    <p>All of the above occupy positions in which they can wield considerable
                        influence over the attitudes and activities of the government. It will be
                        noted that aside from the three deputies only two hold government positions.
                        The majority are directors of mass organizations which have been formed as
                        centers for Communist propaganda and agitation.</p>
                    <p>One of the principal Communist objectives in Guatemala, as elsewhere, has
                        been to gain control of propaganda media. The government radio station TGW
                        is under the direction of <persName>Carlos Alvarado Jerez</persName>, a
                        Communist, and the official government paper, <hi rend="italic">Diario de
                            Centro <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0271"/>America</hi>, gives
                        considerable favorable publicity to Communist-front activities. In addition,
                        there are three other Communist-line papers. The leading Communist-front
                        groups are the National Peace Committee, the AJDG and the FUD. In the case
                        of virtually all front organizations a PGT member will be found in a key
                        post, usually Secretary General or Organizational Secretary.</p>
                    <p>Guatemala has become the focal point of Communism in Central America, and
                        during recent years it has encouraged the growth of Marxist ideas in the
                        neighboring countries of Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. Guatemalan
                        Communists have also been actively engaged in the development of
                        intelligence nets, not only in Guatemala itself, but in the bordering
                        countries. The most active centers of Communist activity in Honduras have
                        been along the border in the area near <persName>San Pedro Sula</persName>.
                        The Guatemalan Consul in that town directs this activity, and Col.
                            <persName>Jose Luis Morales</persName>, Guatemalan Military Attaché in
                        Tegucigalpa, is in charge of Guatemalan Communist activities for Honduras as
                        a whole. During recent months there has been a noticeable expansion of
                        Communist efforts in Honduras, and the number of Guatemalan agents crossing
                        the frontier has increased. Several agents have been sent into Honduras as
                        ostensible exiles with instructions to join opposition groups, especially
                        that headed by Lt. <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Col. Carlos Castillo
                            Armas</persName>. The most recent group of such agents included Capt.

                    <p>In El Salvador the best organized Communist movement is in the railway
                        workers’ union. Communists have planned the assassination of several
                        Salvadoran officials, and Communist plots against the government have been
                        discovered and prevented. During 1953 many Communists were picked up by the
                        police and deported. One such group was suspected of being implicated in an
                        assassination plot against Foreign Minister <persName>Roberto
                            Canessa</persName>. All of these Communist exiles found a safe haven in
                        Guatemala. <persName>Miguel Marmol</persName> and <persName>Virgilio
                            Guerra</persName>, Salvadoran Communists, are active in the Guatemalan
                        labor movement, and there is a group of young Salvadoran leftists under
                        leadership of <persName>Manuel Otilio Hasbun</persName>, formerly President
                        of the General Association of Salvadoran University Students. The latter
                        were warmly welcomed by <persName>Gutierrez</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Exiles from El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic have
                        committees in Guatemala, which work in conjunction with the PGT. The
                        Salvadoran Democratic Association meets in the PGT’s Tribuna Popular.
                        Leftist exiles from many other Latin American countries are also present in
                            Guatemala.<note n="2" xml:id="d130fn2">A handwritten marginal note

                        exiles were involved in the abortive coup in Nicaragua in April 1954, and
                        there are indications that the PGT and the Guatemalan government may have
                        given some support to the preparations for that revolutionary attempt.</p>
                    <p>Over the past five years many prominent Guatemalan Communists and Party
                        sympathizers have travelled to the Soviet Union and the satellite countries.
                        Four Guatemalans attended the Peking Peace Conference in October 1952. In
                        November of that year four delegates were named to the Vienna Peace
                        Congress, and in the following month thirteen Guatemalans attended the
                            <gloss target="#t_WFTU1">WFTU</gloss> Social Security Conference in
                        Vienna. The Guatemalan delegation to the Budapest World Peace Council in
                        June 1953 included Lt. Col. <persName>Carlos Paz Tejada</persName> and Major
                            <persName>Marco Antonio Franco</persName>. During the period from June
                        to December 1953 a total of 48 Guatemalans visited the Russian orbit and
                        eleven of these went to Moscow. In December 1953
                            <persName>Gutierrez</persName> returned from Moscow at the head of a
                        delegation which had toured the Soviet Union after attending the World
                        Federation of Trade Unions (<gloss target="#t_WFTU1">WFTU</gloss>) Congress
                        in Vienna. <persName corresp="#p_FJM1">Fortuny</persName> departed for
                        Moscow in November 1953 and returned to Guatemala on 8 January 1954.</p>
                    <p>Communists have gained control of the Guatemalan labor movement principally
                        by means of a drive to create strong organizations under Party control.
                        Guatemalan labor unions were consolidated into a single main federation, the
                        CGTG, in 1951 under the close supervision of Confederation of Latin American
                        Workers advisers (<gloss target="#t_CTAL1">CTAL</gloss>). Affiliation of the
                        CGTG with the <gloss target="#t_CTAL1">CTAL</gloss> and the <gloss
                            target="#t_WFTU1">WFTU</gloss> followed in 1953. Today organized labor
                        is a militant and significant force in Guatemala. The CGTG has more than 500
                        affiliated unions, and a total of approximately 300,000 members. The
                        Secretary General is <persName>Gutierrez</persName>, member of the Political
                        Committee of the PGT, and every other key office of the CGTG is held by a
                        Communist Party member. <persName>Gutierrez, Pellecer</persName> and
                            <persName>Victor A. Leal</persName> were elected to the General Council
                        of the <gloss target="#t_WFTU1">WFTU</gloss> in November 1953. At the Second
                        National Congress of the CGTG in January 1954 it was proposed that Guatemala
                        resume relations with the Soviet Union and “foreign intervention” was
                        protested. At CGTG headquarters in Guatemala City the red Communist flag
                        flew beside the Guatemalan emblem. The principal foreign delegate to this
                        congress was <persName>Giuseppe Casadei</persName>, member of the permanent
                        staff of the <gloss target="#t_WFTU1">WFTU</gloss> Secretariat in Vienna.

                    <p>Guatemalan Communists adopted Agrarian Reform as their central theme in 1952,
                        and Communists took an active part in committee hearings on the Agrarian Law
                        in Congress. This law created the National Agrarian Department, which is the
                        central administrative agency, and Communists have heavily infiltrated this
                        organization. The head of the Lands Section is Barrios,<note n="3"

                        the PGT chief. Seven of the twenty Agrarian Inspectors are PGT members and
                        another eight are believed to be affiliated with that Party. In addition,
                        another twelve employees are known PGT members.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Martinez</persName> has steadily lost ground in
                        his efforts to have agrarian changes carried out in an orderly manner. In
                        pressing <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Martinez</persName> for rapid
                        implementation of the law the PGT leaders have clearly demonstrated that
                        they regard the present situation as transitory and merely the foundation
                        for the eventual transformation of Guatemala into a Socialist state. The
                        Agrarian Reform program has provided the Communists with weapons which may
                        be useful as their struggle for domination continues. The State has now
                        become by far the country’s largest landholder, since the private lands
                        expropriated under the law have been turned over to the peasants only in
                        life use. The PGT has been successful in identifying itself with the changes
                        being made under Agrarian Reform, and is counting on this situation to break
                        the power of the landowners and United Fruit and bring about its domination
                        of the government. Of late the Party has inspired illegal land seizures
                        which have led to violence in some sections. <persName>Pellecer</persName>,
                        the most aggressive of the PGT leaders, has been assigned the task of
                        inciting the peasants to invade private property. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> himself has described Agrarian
                        Reform as the “most transcendental force in our economic and political
                        life.”</p>
                    <p>In manners such as these, given sufficient freedom in which to operate and
                        faced with ineffective opposition, the Communist organizational and
                        operational techniques tend to confuse and corrupt a country until it can be
                        brought under effective control. The penetration of Communists into selected
                        agencies enables the Party to force policy and personnel changes, nullify
                        opposition and strengthen its capabilities. Communists seek power through
                        the exploitation of any issue and the discontented elements of any
                        group.</p>

                            the general situation as having worsened beyond that described in his

                            leading up to suppression of the independent press. He concluded that
                            the usual diplomatic methods did not suffice to correct the situation
                            and inferred that more drastic and definitive steps to overthrow the

                            that despite the poor situation, there were some events such as the
                            Archbishop’s letter<note n="3" xml:id="d131fn3">On April 4 Guatemalan
                                Archbishop <persName>Mariano Rossell Arellano</persName> issued an

                                found. The Embassy in Guatemala City provided an overview of the
                                letter and its impact in dispatches 852, 856, and 871, April 12, 14,
                                and 23, respectively. (National Archives and Records Administration,
                                RG 59, Central Files, 814.413/4–1254, 714.00(w)/4–1454, and

                            this letter has reached the man in the street and is well received. He
                            suggested that our propaganda not fail and to continue to exploit the
                            letter and tie it into other opportunities.</item>

                        <item>The government, he said, is absolutely under control of a small
                            Communist group and the government as a whole is moving in the direction
                            of Communism. Such things as withdrawal of military pacts and other
                            economic sanctions may irritate these people but will not stop
                            them.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>It was the Ambassador’s opinion that the country is now in a receptive
                            mood and that various groups, particularly the students, are believed to
                            be ready to act. As an example of the atmosphere in Guatemala City, he
                            said that most people are armed when they go to social functions and
                            that all Latin American diplomats are armed wherever they go. The
                            Ambassador saw little to be gained from economic sanctions and from OAS
                            action and agreed with the view expressed that the United States would
                            face less of an outcry if it achieved a successful coup than it would
                            during a long trying period of sanctions which, in <pb n="245"
                                xml:id="pg_245" facs="0275"/>any case, will possibly not be
                            effective. He did not think, moreover, that Latin American countries,
                            with the possible exception of Mexico and the Argentine, would go after
                            the United States following a reasonably secure coup. In connection with
                            the consideration of economic sanctions he pointed out that in Guatemala
                            time is running against us.</item>

                            current political thinking, he recommended we consult

                            Chimaltenango. In reply to a question as to <persName corresp="#p_DCCE1"

                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJE1">Peurifoy</persName> is inclined
                            to doubt this as he believes that if it were true <persName

                        <item>As to the attitude of the army, Ambassador noted that there are all
                            sorts of reports but that it is his view that the army is opportunistic
                            and would move against the government if they thought it to be to their
                            advantage. He said that the army is in a vulnerable position because
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> could gradually remove
                            suspected officers from key positions and replace them with others.
                            Ambassador concluded that time is running against us, particularly with
                            regard to the army. The political situation is worsening he believes as
                            the other parties of the national front, while they are not Communist,
                            are falling more and more under the influence of Communist
                            leadership.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>In speaking of the need for action in Guatemala, the Ambassador said,
                            “If we maintain the status quo, we shall in the end have to use ‘those
                            gallant marines.’”</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>He stated the belief that hard hitting speeches against Guatemala by
                            personages in the United States Government could be counterproductive
                            and would particularly alienate those non-Communists whose actions are
                            influenced by nationalist emotions.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>He expressed doubt as to the feasibility of the “cotton plan” and
                            believed that the alternative plan to blow up cotton gins owned by the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> coterie would be
                            desirable. He stated occasional sabotage of pipelines, one or two
                            bridges and installations in the Puerto Barrios area would cause great
                            commotion in the country.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>He specifically recommended a leaflet air drop on Guatemala City on
                            May Day and suggested the leaflet material should include some reference

                            nervousness on the part of the government.</item>

                        <item>We consider that the conclusions of NIE–84 remain essentially valid.
                            In particular, we reaffirm the first conclusion, as follows: <quote

                                <p>The current political situation in Guatemala is adverse to US
                                    interests. The Guatemalan Communists exercise a political
                                    influence far out of proportion to their small numerical
                                    strength. Their influence will probably continue to grow as long
                                    as President <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>

                        <item>The Communists now effectively control the political life of
                            Guatemala. <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>’ decisions on
                            domestic and foreign policy are reached, not in the official cabinet,
                            but in a kitchen cabinet composed of Communists and pro-Communists.
                            There is no prospect of a break between <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1"
                                >Arbenz</persName> and the Communists.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>There has probably been an increase in popular disillusionment with
                            the <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> regime. There is
                            certainly increased desperation among opposition elements.<note n="3"

                            possibility of effective internal political action to alter the
                            situation does not exist. We believe that effective revolutionary action
                            would require the active support of a major portion of the Army.</item>

                        <item>The disposition of the Army toward the regime is therefore crucial. We
                            note indications of unrest, even of disaffection, within the Army and
                            consider that a revolutionary potential now exists there. We do not
                            believe, however, that the Guatemalan Army is likely to take spontaneous
                            action against the <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>

                            potential in the Army, and, with the passage of time, may succeed in
                            doing so.</item>

                            <item>This conclusion remains valid. Under the patronage of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>, Communist influence in
                                Guatemala has grown during the past year and will probably continue
                                to grow. This growth is not the result of any innovation, but of a
                                year’s further development along the lines previously established.
                                For example: <list>
                                    <label>a.</label>
                                    <item>There has been further development in the organization of
                                        rural workers as a political force under Communist influence
                                        and control (as was anticipated in the sixth conclusion of
                                        NIE–84). The Communists have demonstrated a capability for
                                        the rapid mobilization and assembly of considerable numbers
                                        of these workers for political demonstrations.</item>
                                    <label>b.</label>
                                    <item>The Communists are probably also capable of mobilizing up
                                        to 20,000 of these workers as an armed militia available to
                                        support the regime in an emergency. We cannot confirm
                                        reports of the existence of such a para-military force, but
                                        would consider it a logical development in the
                                        circumstances. There is good reason to believe that the

                                factor in the situation. In modification of the second sentence of
                                the quoted paragraph, we note certain indications of unrest, even of
                                disaffection, among Army officers which suggest that the

                                follow their leaders. This difference is a matter of emphasis rather

                        as follows:</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here are the Conclusions from <ref target="#d132">Document
                        132</ref>.]</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">B. Assets Available to <gloss

                    <p>a. <hi rend="italic">General</hi></p>
                    <p>Before listing specific assets, the population of Guatemala should be
                        mentioned as a strong, potential asset. Predominantly anti-Communist the
                        people, once aroused from their normal political inertia, could play a
                        powerful role against the <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>
                        regime. Increasing government repression and Communist brutality are having
                        their effect evidenced in numerous instances of popular unrest throughout
                        the country. A few typical examples taken at random are the signature of an
                        anti-Communist petition by 50 people in Communist Escuintla; a new <pb
                            n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0282"/>vigorously anti-Communist newspaper
                        in Chiquimula; large pockets of averred anti-Communists at numerous points
                        in the Mazatenango area; public meetings attended by several hundred people
                        at Puerto Barrios; and the denial to the Communists of the local labor
                        organization at Quezaltenango.</p>
                    <p>Though only tied together informally at present, considerable focus has been
                        given to the large Catholic group by the extremely effective pastoral letter
                        of April 4 issued by the Archbishop of Guatemala urging all Catholics to
                        combat Communism. This letter, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                            text not declassified</hi>], can, and it is believed will, have
                        continuing effect if its message is continuously replayed.</p>
                    <p>Additional unity of purpose is provided by the psychological assets available
                        in Guatemala as well as the encouragement generated by the vague but growing
                        recognition that “something is in the air”—a well-backed movement is around
                        the corner. <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Calligeris</persName>’ announced
                        leadership and well-received political manifesto of late February have
                        contributed to this. It has also been a consequence of the paramilitary
                        program, not presently military and formidable, but psychologically
                        persuasive. A consciousness of the stick behind the carrot is considered a
                        prerequisite to creating any effective opposition in Guatemala,
                        Communist-dominated as it is today.</p>
                    <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Psychological</hi></p>
                    <p>Psychological assets include many newspapers and radio stations, not
                        controlled or influenced by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, which are
                        still independent. “El Espectador”, for example, is strongly anti-Communist.
                        So is <persName>Clemente Marroquin Rojas</persName>, the most influential
                        journalist in Guatemala City. Admittedly these independents must move with
                        caution and their days of independence may well be numbered but for the
                        moment they survive.</p>
                    <p>A controlled group in Guatemala City publishes a weekly, “El Rebelde”,
                        directs poster and leaflet teams, a telephone provocation team, “goon”
                        squads and runs intermittent radio broadcasts. It also operates a political
                        organization consisting of a coalition of numerous political groups known as
                        the National Anti-Communist Front (<gloss target="#t_FAN1">FAN</gloss>),
                        which provides coverage of the entire country. This is supplemented by a
                        special group, “Inspectors”, who periodically travel throughout the country
                        contacting numerous agents.</p>
                    <p>Several other small anti-Communist publications in various parts of Guatemala
                        receive financial aid and guidance.</p>
                    <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Military and Paramilitary</hi></p>
                    <p>As stated above the Board of National Estimates concludes that a
                        revolutionary potential exists in the Guatemalan Army. Specific data may be
                        adduced to confirm this estimate.</p>
                    <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0283"/>
                    <p>Disaffection and dissatisfaction are evident throughout all echelons. The
                        high command is particularly vulnerable to defection and in some instances
                        defection in place is practically assured. The Minister of National Defense,
                            <persName>Jose Angel Sanchez</persName>, is opposed to Communist control
                        over <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> and is considered
                        inclined towards supporting any well-organized opposition movement. The
                        Chief of the Armed Forces <persName corresp="#p_DCCE1">Colonel Carlos
                            Enrique Diaz</persName>, is probably discredited and considered no
                        longer loyal to <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>. The Chief of
                        Staff, Colonel <persName>Enrique Parinello de Leon</persName>, has
                        repeatedly indicated his desire to see the end of the Communist-controlled
                        regime. The Chief of the Air Force, Colonel <persName>Luis A.
                            Giron</persName>, is believed disaffected. The Minister without
                        Portfolio, <persName corresp="#p_MCE1">Colonel Elfego Monzon</persName>, is
                        actively, covertly organizing within the Army for a coup [<hi rend="italic"
                            >less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. Plans are under
                        way to incorporate his assets with those of the Junta and a meeting is being
                        planned to effect this union. Thus, within the high command a definite
                        capability exists to defect in place sufficient numbers of influential
                        military leaders to ensure control over the Armed Forces before any overt
                        action is undertaken.</p>
                    <p>In furtherance of the objective to defect the Army, two distinct operations
                        are in progress; the Junta, through its military contacts and an independent
                        effort by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> targeted at key personnel. The
                        Junta leadership, being primarily composed of Guatemalan Army officers in
                        exile, has achieved certain success to date. The leaders of this
                        organizational effort have been examined by polygraph and cleared as to the
                        validity of their statements. The independent effort is now being carried
                        out by a case officer in the field following 60 days of intensive study of
                        the most promising targets of importance.</p>
                    <p>In addition, a military organization of younger officers positively pledged
                        to <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Calligeris</persName> is in existence. They
                        have been organized and contacted by <persName corresp="#p_CJH1"
                            >Calligeris</persName>’ military representative in Guatemala. The
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Calligeris</persName> organization presently
                        has four trusted military leaders in the four sectors of Guatemala City and
                        a leader in each of the nine target garrisons. These leaders estimate that,
                        on D-Day, they can capture from within all the garrisons except Quiche,
                        Mazatenango and San Jose, where added efforts to prepare capitulation are in
                        progress.</p>
                    <p>At best, the apparently “safe” garrisons will be taken without firing a shot.
                        Where this does not work, correct disposition of friendly elements plus the
                        denial of weapons and ammunition to enemy forces should quell opposition. If
                        necessary, civilian paramilitary units will step in to provide overwhelming
                        force.</p>
                    <p>As regards this civilian paramilitary organization, substantial numbers of
                        men in each of the nine garrison areas in Guatemala are already pledged. The
                        number of men available in each garrison area are listed <pb n="254"
                            xml:id="pg_254" facs="0284"/>below. Three columns are given to show the
                        various estimates, ranging from the most conservative to the optimistic.
                        Column I figures cannot, of course, be guaranteed but are the result of
                        checking <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Calligeris</persName>’ figures with
                        individual leaders who have been exfiltrated from Guatemala. These figures
                        have been sufficiently confirmed by questioning, where possible, that it is
                        the belief of the <persName>Lincoln</persName> staff that they are accurate.
                        Moreover, in no instance has questioning shown initial estimates to be
                        seriously erroneous.</p>

                        will be beamed at Guatemala from where it will be purportedly broadcasting.
                        Programs are planned for the next thirty to forty days and two weeks of
                        tapes are now ready for use. This radio will also provide the radio support

                        is undesirable in which case a contingency station fully under our control
                        will be used. Preparations for this installation are substantially
                        completed.</p>
                    <p>A writing staff of Guatemalans has been installed in safe houses near

                        which is providing substantial raw material for the writers. This is
                        supplemented by hourly FBIS service and the receipt within 18 hours of
                        publication of daily newspapers from Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua,

                        will be called the “Congress Against Soviet Intervention in Latin America”.
                        It will be attended by many prominent anti-Communists from every country in
                        Latin America and will have as its main object the focusing of the attention
                        of Latin Americans on the Communist situation in Guatemala thereby
                        constituting a call for all anti-Communists to aid in the struggle.</p>

                        that the U.S. would be accused of being the main sponsor of most if not all

                            >Arbenz</persName> regime. Written statements to this effect were
                        included in the report on Stage One written in December 1953;<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d133fn3">See <ref target="#d75fn1">footnote 1, Document

                        been numerous oral reports to the same effect. Moreover it has been
                        consistently assumed that in an operation of this scope some evidence
                        supporting the accusations would unavoidably be available to unfriendly
                        powers or individuals. Nevertheless it was concluded that there was
                        sufficient likelihood that no irrefutable evidence of a legal nature would
                        be discovered to justify the undertaking particularly when the risks were
                        weighed against the importance of the project.</p>

                        indicates that so far the estimates have been accurate and that security has
                        been as well maintained in this project as could reasonably be expected.
                        Consequently it is fair to assume that no irrefutable evidence tying the
                        project to the U.S. Government is in the hands of the enemy. It would of
                        course be as impossible in this case as in all others to guarantee this last
                        statement but it can be asserted that the risks of U.S. involvement today
                        are not such as to warrant, in our opinion, a termination or modification of
                        the project on security grounds, if it is otherwise desirable.</p>
                    <p>Added support in cloaking the U.S. hand exists in the number of other

                        affairs with the acquiescence of “the government of the North”. Much of the
                        “evidence” appended to the White Paper was quickly established as spurious

                        the North” was intended to mean Mexico or the United States. Consequently
                        nothing in the White Paper established official U.S. involvement. Continued

                        reinforced suspicions among all those previously inclined to suspect the
                        U.S. but was roundly disbelieved by the majority of anti-Communists in
                        Central America.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion the following observations on the question of U.S. involvement
                        seem appropriate: <list>

                            <item>Although a number of individuals in both the Nicaraguan and
                                Honduran Governments are personally convinced that the U.S. is
                                favorably disposed toward this operation and although the Guatemalan
                                regime may and probably does have indications to this effect,
                                plausible denial by the U.S. in response to any charges could still
                                be sustained. This would be especially true if the Guatemalan regime
                                had been effectively overthrown and its leaders scattered.</item>
                            <label>b.</label>
                            <item>There is not the slightest doubt that if the operation is carried
                                through many Latin Americans will see in it the hand of the U.S. But
                                it is equally true that they would see the hand of the U.S. in any
                                uprising whether or not sponsored by the U.S., particularly since
                                the U.S. has made it clear in many overt ways that it heartily
                                disapproves of the <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>
                                regime. In short it might be said that the only way to forestall
                                such a belief is for the U.S. to make sure that there is no
                                revolution, which we are in no position to do since there is good
                                reason to believe that some one of the other potential sponsors will
                                in all probability press for the revolution which under such
                                circumstances (a) would in all likelihood abort and (b) would be
                                laid at our door anyhow.</item>

                                shown, a serious question is raised as to whether any operation of
                                this kind can appropriately be included as one of the U.S. cold war

                            effort toward the earliest feasible conclusion. Some adjustment of the

                            developments. There would, of course, be an understanding that the final
                            phase would not be authorized unless and until the Director had
                            satisfied himself that conditions were favorable for the success of the

                            thereof, and postponing paramilitary action until October or later. This
                            would have to assume that there could be a vigorous and coordinated

                            overthrow the present regime. What is specifically proposed is to begin
                            with a strong official statement of the United States position toward
                            the present regime in Guatemala, followed by an attempt to secure the
                            support of the Caracas majority at an OAS meeting in September for the
                            application against Guatemala of the sanctions envisaged in the Rio
                            Pact. Essentially this would involve an economic and communications
                            blockade of Guatemala by OAS members or at least by those members
                            willing to support and join in the action.</item>

                        <item>The best chance of removing the <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1"
                                >Arbenz</persName> regime is to proceed as energetically as possible
                            along the lines of the present plan. There is evidence of political and
                            psychological unrest within Guatemala and of growing hostility to the
                            regime. A revolutionary potential exists in the Army. Continued
                            application of planned and integrated pressures should force
                            progressively greater unrest and defection while removal of such
                            pressures will greatly strengthen the opposition and discourage or
                            disaffect allies and potential allies.</item>

                        <item>It is fair to assume that no irrefutable evidence tying the project to
                            the U.S. Government is in the hands of the enemy. The security of the
                            project is as good as can be expected and fully in keeping with the
                            estimates made and reported on numerous occasions starting with the
                            beginning of the project. Any action against the <persName

                            would hesitate to support near its elections, even assuming it still has
                            a stable and friendly government; and Nicaraguan support would diminish
                            if it could be counted on at all; disruption of the present defection
                            program, both military and civilian, which is geared to early action;
                            loss of intelligence as a result of the effect of further evidence of

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> spoke first, saying that
                        “we have the full green light and the go ahead.” This was in regard to
                        policy and he indicated that he was not addressing himself to operational
                        considerations. With regard to flights, approach, etc.—it is all in the
                        affirmative. He mentioned there may be operational consideration requiring
                        that the program be shifted forward from the present date or other changes
                        and the staff should bear in mind constantly the importance of maintaining a
                        sufficient degree of flexibility in their approach to this thing so that the
                        program can be adjusted to fit the need.</p>
                    <p>It was strongly recommended that none of this relieved us of the
                        responsibility we owe to our government and ourselves to so conduct this
                        operation that there will be a minimum possible chance of it being pinned on
                        the U.S. officially and conclusively and so as to maximize the possibility
                        that when the blame gets around to being placed, such confusion will exist
                        as to who did it that it can’t be sorted out.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> did not think false
                        trails had been sufficiently developed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BTPWD1">Barnes</persName> stated that he considered
                        himself here largely in the capacity of a Headquarters representative. He
                        brings some of the Headquarters thinking here and will take back there from
                        time to time the thinking here. He stated that [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] had been chief of operations and will continue to be
                        but that he, <persName corresp="#p_BTPWD1">Barnes</persName>, will help in
                        any way that he can.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] then started a very general
                        briefing covering most of the aspects of <gloss target="#t_PBSPBSUCCESS1"
                            >PBSUCCESS</gloss> in general, reserving for various individuals
                        directly concerned the more specific aspects of KUHOOK, <gloss
                            target="#t_KUFIRE1">KUFIRE</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_KUGOWN1"
                            >KUGOWN</gloss> situation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> stated that the Director
                        is always going to reserve the final judgment as to when to pull the last
                        switch. He has to be satisfied that we have sufficient elements of strength
                        and status of readiness. He <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0293"/>is
                        interested only in the success of the operation. He is not interested
                        policy-wise. There is no operation regarded as being so important as this
                        one and no operation on which the reputation of the Agency is more at
                        stake.</p>
                    <p>The boss has to be satisfied that we have what it takes. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> stated that he did not anticipate
                        lengthy delays but there might be operational considerations which
                            <persName>LINCOLN</persName> would know more about than Washington which
                        would temporarily alter plans. He suggested that when
                            <persName>LINCOLN</persName> has something really good, Headquarters
                        should be told about it, slug it for the boss’ attention.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> requested documents which
                        are available at <persName>LINCOLN</persName> showing the internal strength
                        and what the opposition is. He stated that Headquarters had never received a
                        clear and concise statement of what the plans are with respect to what takes
                        place on D-day. He had thought that Headquarters had this but apparently if
                        they do no one can find it. He asked for about 2 pages on this subject.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] said that no detailed tactical
                        plan had been contemplated till it was known what we had. Now we were
                        concerned with the development of assets. [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] then proceeded with the general briefing, touching
                        briefly on Regional Command, <persName>LINCOLN</persName> set-up, etc. and
                        stated the fact that Security is here being used operationally.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> asked for information
                        about <gloss target="#t_SCRANTON1">SCRANTON</gloss>–<gloss
                            target="#t_SHERWOOD1">SHERWOOD</gloss>. The question of being sure about
                        communications between [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>], the
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Calligeris</persName>’ Command Post and
                        station was raised and discussed at length. Statement was made that two
                        lines of communications will be available—through the <gloss target="#t_CP1"
                            >CP</gloss> (indigenous) and through the station.</p>
                    <p>PT/16 discussion was reserved for afternoon discussion.</p>
                    <p>Intelligence breakdown of <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> net was
                        discussed. Development chart was displayed (and explanations given re
                        progress marked on same).</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> questioned what should be
                        told the Chargé in Guatemala about reporting on <gloss target="#t_SHERWOOD1"
                            >SHERWOOD</gloss> when it goes on the air.</p>
                    <p>It is felt that we have the capability of reaching operational readiness
                        during the month of June. Lots of factors have bearing on that and certain
                        operations may not develop as planned but we are aware of that. Though we
                        have a plan laid out, we know there can be changes and are prepared to be
                        flexible.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] asked that the KUHOOK briefing
                        be left till last in order that it could be properly seen in focus.</p>
                    <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0294"/>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] was asked to explain the PP
                        operations. He stated that their main asset is <gloss target="#t_SHERWOOD1"
                            >SHERWOOD</gloss> and that 6 days programs are already taped.</p>
                    <p>Issue was raised about possibility of substituting tapes in order to provide
                        current coverage of any developments of interest. Mr. [<hi rend="italic"
                            >name not declassified</hi>] mentioned that <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1"
                            >RUFUS</gloss> had a man with a good radio voice whom they proposed to
                        bring up and train and then send back for use in just such instances. [<hi
                            rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] disapproved this plan because
                        it is planned that no indigenous personnel from the <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJH1">Calligeris</persName> group will be used at the site.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> felt that the use of the
                        radio was a very important point and its effectiveness and impact is
                        proportionate to the speed with which it acts. He cited as an example Radio
                        Free Europe. A discussion on this subject between Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName>, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BRMLPE1">Bissell</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BTPWD1">Barnes</persName> and [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] followed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> was informed by [<hi
                            rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] of the possibility of using
                        Marine Air Force for special flights to Panama. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> said he would go to work on this
                        when he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRMLPE1">Bissell</persName> returned
                        to Headquarters, and that he would not need a follow-up cable on this.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_SHERWOOD1">SHERWOOD</gloss> is to be on the air two hours a
                        day as of 1 May and this will be lengthened to 4 hours a day. There is a
                        possibility of plugging this station’s program in on a government-sponsored
                        program eventually.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] discussed the military paper
                        now being published. The articles in this are being prepared by army
                        officers on <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss>’ staff. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LRG1">Leddy</persName> (<gloss target="#t_ODACID1"
                            >ODACID</gloss>) was concerned with the possibility that, if the tone of
                        this paper were not sufficiently modulated and if the paper should be
                        believed by the people to be published by an underground group within the
                        existing Guatemalan army, it might cause an early purge of the Guatemalan
                        army.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] said that this could not
                        happen because the army paper started in the exiles’ paper and the articles
                        are signed by the true names of the people writing them. Texts have so far
                        been restricted. Tempo has been gauged to the time and now articles are
                        moderate.</p>
                    <p><persName>Cruz Wer</persName> was brought up and the program against him,
                        with its results, was discussed.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">El Rebelde</hi> is being published again. The “32” program
                        is in action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> suggested
                        that Headquarters should propagandize the “32” campaign and <persName
                            corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>’ reaction to it and tell what the
                        “32” means. This should be circulated. “<persName corresp="#p_AGJ1"
                            >Arbenz</persName> is arresting patriots who are in favor of keeping out
                        foreign intervention.”</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] stated that currently rumors
                        are being circulated. Presently there is a rumor in the rural areas that
                        government leaders <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0295"/>have prepared
                        for flight abroad. On the other side, there is a rumor that <persName
                            corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> is on the way.</p>
                    <p>Mr. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] stated that <gloss
                            target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> is encouraged now. Our reasons for
                        delays have been kept from him. The political plan “Cruz y Quetzal” was
                        reviewed with <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> during [<hi
                            rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] visit with him. They (<gloss
                            target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss>) favor it but feel it is a bit flowery.
                        They feel that the idea of “Cruz y Quetzal” should be retained but want to
                        include the Plan of Tegucigalpa and the joint result would be “Cruz y
                        Quetzal”. They played down the Indian thing and also read out the part about
                        the U.S. having a commercial influence there.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> had three questions troubling him: 1.
                        What would be the Group’s attitude if a group of anti-Arbenz and
                        anti-Communist officers grab the ball and prematurely take over the
                        government? What would the Group’s attitude be in such an event? (Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> said we will stay on his
                        side. “He is our hero.”) 2. <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1">RUFUS</gloss> is
                        worried about the approaching elections in Honduras since
                            <persName>Galvez</persName>’ position weakens daily. (Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> said that <gloss
                            target="#t_SKILLET1">SKILLET</gloss> had briefed them on this and he is
                        worried about the local situation.) 3. <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1"
                            >RUFUS</gloss> is worried about his 80–100 trained men now in
                        Tegucigalpa over whom he virtually has no control until he gives the battle
                        cry. The town is full of Guatemalan agents. He is worried about getting them
                        out of Tegucigalpa. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName>
                        agreed that he had a problem there.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> suggested to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BRMLPE1">Bissell</persName> that with help from
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BTPWD1">Barnes</persName> a paper be prepared to
                        show <persName corresp="#p_HHF1">Holland</persName> which points out to him
                        the things done and being done which are exclusive of the PM aspect. He (Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HHF1">Holland</persName>) has been told about
                        certain things. The paper we have talks about assets and he wants to talk
                        about action. The manner of building up the stories on the police chief is
                        colorful—this shows results.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> said we have to make this
                        thing stick. <gloss target="#t_ODACID1">ODACID</gloss> admits they are at
                        fault in not having a program for making this thing sure and making it stick
                        once we have done it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName>
                        spoke of economic assistance, being prepared to recognize the new
                        government, making statements about it once it has been accomplished. We
                        should get credit for what we are doing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1"
                            >Wisner</persName> stated he was not sure <gloss target="#t_ODACID1"
                            >ODACID</gloss> would be kept up-to-date at all; but they needed to be
                        given something to tide this over. It is a privilege for <gloss
                            target="#t_ODACID1">ODACID</gloss> to be kept informed, not a right.</p>
                    <p>It was suggested that the Pastoral Letter be included in the paper for <gloss
                            target="#t_ODACID1">ODACID</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] was asked to give 5 minutes
                        information on EEIs gathered.</p>
                    <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0296"/>
                    <p>Mr. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] was asked to give a short
                        briefing on [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] mission. He
                        stated we gather intelligence from SEMANTIC and SECANT who are now back in
                        Guatemala.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> questioned if we were
                        getting anything from the military missions in the target country. If we
                        wait till the last minute to ask that they be withdrawn, they won’t do it.
                        He requested that <persName>LINCOLN</persName> advise what was desired to do
                        about the mission. Is it desirable that steps be taken now to prepare for
                        its withdrawal? (about 15 May). The withdrawal should be so designed that it
                        can be played up for propaganda purposes. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJE1"
                            >Peurifoy</persName> said that the Air Mission has not been doing what
                        was requested of it.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] stated that we are over 18
                        days behind on black flights. We feel that we should have an extra aircraft
                        added in order to make up this deficit. AMD, last week, assured him they
                        were able to provide this aircraft within a maximum of 7–8 days. This would
                        be plane and crew. Crew would have to use the same cover story as the others
                        have. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> was concerned with
                        the security angle with regard to extra crew rather than the plane. He said
                        he would take this matter up on his return to Headquarters. He would favor
                        an extra plane rather than the crew. It was requested that at least the
                        plane be procured since we are pressing luck in using only 2 aircraft.</p>
                    <p>There followed a general discussion of the labor situation. The Labor Board
                        wants to know everything. There is friction between the unions. This would
                        be a cold approach to the head of the Steel Workers Union. [<hi
                            rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] brought up the fact that we
                        have spotted and cleared an Aprista down there. He will work operationally
                        through [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]. The man who was
                        chosen was chosen because he knows the field and has the necessary
                        qualifications. Originally this approach was to be most informal—not to be a
                        firm proposition.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> requested information on
                        the deception program with the New Orleans angle. [<hi rend="italic">name
                            not declassified</hi>] had prepared a follow-up on this and would brief
                        him after lunch.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFHSW1">Wisner</persName> said he thought everyone
                        would agree that it was very important for [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] to have the talk with [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>], find out what is motivating him (is he abandoning
                        the ship or is it that he feels he has done all that he can usefully do?).
                            [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] was requested to assess
                        his reasons. Find out what it is that has caused him to take this move. If
                        he is getting out because he has lost confidence, find out why. If his
                        answer is negative, don’t accept it as a final answer; keep the issue open.
                        Tell [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] that you ([<hi
                            rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]) will have to come back <pb
                            n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0297"/>and talk to the Group. He has had
                        his feelings hurt. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] was
                        instructed not to let [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] break
                        the conversation finally. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRMLPE1"
                            >Bissell</persName> suggested that [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] attempt to get [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] to postpone the date he had given for severance. [<hi
                            rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] said [<hi rend="italic">name
                            not declassified</hi>] had put on paper several incidents which happened
                        after his trip to Mexico—but chiefly the fact of his poor health prompted
                        this move.</p>
                    <p>Meeting adjourned at 1230, with Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> scheduled
                        to give a briefing at 1400.</p>

                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WW1">Willauer</persName> proposed [<hi

                            do anything to stop the sabotage especially since he had a suspect in
                            view and that this gave little basis for hoping that a lone American
                            could do better. Mr. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]
                            raised the question as to whether <gloss target="#t_RUFUS1"

                        <item>As a general commentary upon this or any other proposed use of
                            aircraft, request that you consider the impression which will be created
                                <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0302"/>by and the conclusions
                            which will be drawn from, the obviously integrated use of aircraft in
                            conjunction with D-day operations. It seems to HQs that the addition of
                            this mechanistic refinement coming on top of the use of radio and other
                            intricate features of the plan will almost inevitably set upon this
                            operation the seal of a non-Latin product. This is entirely apart from
                            the strict question of security, the point being that even if we were
                            able to do this without security leaks and without any mishap, the
                            conclusion would nevertheless be drawn by our friends and foes alike in
                            the United Nations, etc. that this could not be anything other than what
                            it in fact is, and certainly could not be an indigenous uprising.</item>

                            communist purposes. One way of starting this might be to assert that
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCCE1">Diaz</persName> have consented to have the
                            Caribbean Legion supplemented not only by arms and equipment from the
                            regular Guatemalan Army but by regular army personnel as well. One of
                                <persName corresp="#p_FJM1">Manuel</persName>’s sources inside the
                            army (or inside some suitable government office) may have come across
                            evidence—a secret document, or the record of conversation between
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> and a likely communist
                            leader, presumably <persName corresp="#p_FJM1">Fortuny</persName>.
                            According to that document (it might also be presented as an interview),
                            Moscow is very dissatisfied with the failure of the attempt against
                                <persName corresp="#p_SGA1">Somoza</persName>, feels that the
                            Caribbean Legion will never fulfill its purpose unless it is bolstered
                            by regular, trained military personnel and demands therefore that
                            selected groups of officers and EM of the regular Army be assigned to
                            Legion “commando"-type enterprises, naturally not openly, but under
                            appropriate cover. (This theme lends itself primarily to dissemination
                            by rumors.)</item>

                        <item>The next step might be a direct, formal warning to all military
                            personnel against penetration of the Army by the Communist Party and
                            against political snooping by these cells. Based on the fact that all
                            Communist Parties anywhere, since the very foundation of the Communist
                            International, have been under the strictest orders to penetrate the
                            armed forces of their respective countries, it is only natural that the
                            Guatemalan <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss> follows the same pattern.
                            You might mention in this connection that Communist Parties have been
                            known to use the charms of the female members of their youth groups to
                            make contacts with military personnel (if you and <persName

                            against the AJDG will be believed, you might put this very specifically,
                            quoting actual incidents). He might also broadcast or print an interview
                            with a <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss> defector who discloses party
                            activities in forming cells inside the armed forces.</item>

                        <item>This campaign should reach its climax around 1 June with the
                            disclosure that <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> has
                            concluded a secret pact with the <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss>
                            (perhaps directly with an emissary from Moscow or at least in his
                            presence) about the bolshevization of the armed forces, providing for
                            the appointment of political commissars in all units and for the arrival
                            of a Red Army (possibly: Czechoslovak Army) training and the
                            indoctrination mission—perhaps to be disguised as a trade or “cultural
                            exchange” mission, but conceivably also quite openly. This development
                            would correspond to the changes which the armed forces underwent in all
                            countries in which the communists have seized power. You might add that
                            the pact also provides for an extension of military conscription and
                            that those conscripts for whom there will be no arms immediately
                            available (especially since the Caribbean Legion and other aggressive,
                            revolutionary <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0306"/>enterprises will

                            for the construction of military airfields, border fortifications and
                            other work resulting from a communist foreign policy for Guatemala. This
                            announcement should be made in a spectacular manner, based on either an
                            intercepted official document, the letter of a high <gloss

                    <p>49462. 1. Background: During past month Guat Govt overtly and covertly
                        eliminated all vestige free radio. Radio Voz de la Capital ceased
                        broadcasting after personnel attacked by masked persons. 5 April,
                            <persName>Oscar Conde</persName>, opposition radio commentator, was
                        arrested on return from Caracas. April reports from inside Guat indicated
                        all anti-Commie programs were clandestinely jammed by Guat police.
                            <persName>Roberto Vizcaino, owner</persName> of Radio Continental, which
                        also broadcast anti-Commie news, was forced out of Guat and station turned
                        over to Commies for use. (Disposition to “Tribuna Popular” Commies rumored.)
                        On 21 April, Radio Internacional was invaded by five masked, armed men and
                        all staff was tied, one brutally beaten and all equipment destroyed. Station
                        had been broadcasting “anti-Commie hour” sponsored by “student anti-Commie
                        assn.” Last week, Radio Telefunken canceled news program on grounds program
                        contained “political thoughts”. On 1 May, Guat Govt openly informed all Guat
                        stations that Article 37 of Congressional Decree 372 requires all privately
                        owned radio stations to record and submit all broadcasts re national or
                        international politics to Guat Min of Communications within 24 hours prior
                        to broadcast. Recordings be reviewed by Guat Minister <persName>Charnaud
                            MacDonald</persName> and be returned in “due course”.</p>
                    <p>2. Brief of May 5 special to <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> by
                            <persName>Paul Kennedy</persName> follows:</p>
                    <p>Guat Government has officially acknowledged existence clandestine radio
                        station broadcasting anti Communist material. Matter was brought to
                        attention of government by Commie controlled Confederacion General de
                        Trabajadores de Guatemala which claimed it had learned station located in
                        San Marcos Department of Guatemala near Mexican border. Police, however,
                        subsequently stated belief it behind Honduran border, according government
                        statement station called “voice of liberation”. This given in context of
                        reference to many Guat Govt acts suppressing freedom of speech, e.g.,
                        actions censoring and suppressing radios and newspapers.</p>
                    <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0308"/>
                    <p>3. Request implement and sustain above story. Emphasize station came up soon
                        after repression free speech by government and speculate it may be manned by
                        Guat radio personnel who joined forces opposing government when they
                        received advance warning of government repression.</p>
                    <p>4. Play following variations. Original information re location station within
                        Guat altered by police for following reasons. (1) They cannot stand admit
                        strength of opposition within country. (2) Government desires mount
                        provocation against Honduras to cloak possible overt acts against
                        Honduras.</p>

                        Communist controlled government. (3) Government reported planning confiscate
                        private radio receivers; people buying up spare receivers to have one in

                                        >Calligeris</persName> personality trait which is now
                                    clearly recognizable. He is a firmly stubborn man who in the
                                    face of indisputable evidence is prone to maintain his own point
                                    of view. The manner in which he defends his own decisions is
                                    interesting. Personal experience has shown that <persName
                                        corresp="#p_CJH1">Calligeris</persName> will yield readily

                                    promising that changes as suggested will be carried out.
                                    However, his execution of the details of any agreement will be
                                    as he sees fit. This completely modifies his original agreement
                                    with general plans. His geographical position plus the lack of a
                                    group contact with him who can effectively assure his completion
                                    of activities, has given him reason to believe that he can
                                    modify to suit his own desires any orders or instructions from
                                        [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] or the Group.

                                    increase his necessity to take the initiative when he, from his

                                    Group or subordinates in his group to examine more closely their
                                    loyalty—has become proportionately more loyal in defending the

                                    is the fact that both men in the past made many open and also

                                    still on the scene, he would undoubtedly be able to command
                                    certain support which would render the task of friendly forces
                                    more difficult. If the issue were in doubt, his personal ability
                                    and prestige could tip the scales unfavorably. An attempt should
                                    therefore be made to have victory grow out of the disposal of

                        <item>In any program of this sort, the possibilities of reprisals and their
                            damaging effect on the D-Day objective must be considered. The above
                            actions would undoubtedly invite some reprisals and lead to an attempt
                            on the part of the government to tighten security. However, such
                            government actions in the period D–14 to D-Day must be expected anyway.
                            On the other hand, successful accomplishment of the above actions should
                            cause panic among the government sympathizers and possibly negate their
                            increased vigilance. At the same time, friendly forces should be greatly
                            heartened and mobilized. The program as described above would give
                            enough time for both enemy disintegration and friendly mobilization
                            prior to D-Day. On balance, it is believed that these shows of friendly
                            strength and these efforts to “soften up” the enemy would be beneficial
                            and would decrease the risk of putting all <gloss

                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>We understand that the story of the unidentified submarine which
                            landed in Nicaragua, caching arms of Communist origin at the shore, did
                            not receive much, if any, publicity in the Guatemalan press. This story
                            however should not only interest Guatemalan newspapers because it
                            concerns a rather ominous event in a neighboring country, but most
                            specifically since certain communications implicate Guatemala directly.
                            The most specific of these clues were the cigarettes of Guatemalan
                            origin found together with the weapons: this has received ample
                            publicity in Nicaragua as shown by the attached masthead of <hi
                                rend="italic">Novedades</hi>, Managua, 7 May, which carries a
                            headline referring to those cigarettes, even above the masthead, across
                            the entire page.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>We suggest therefore that you make a cautious effort to obtain added
                            publicity for this story in the Guatemalan press and public opinion. We
                            would consider it particularly apt if you could induce one of the
                            oppositional members of the Guatemalan congress to address a letter to
                            the President, expressing concern about these clues, pointing at
                            Guatemalan complicity in this arms smuggling affair and demanding a
                            full, public investigation. He might add (if you consider that feasible)
                            that he is greatly concerned by the fact that the Guatemalan Army has
                            been receiving recently its arms and equipment in more or less
                            clandestine and illegal ways which are unworthy of the honor and proud
                            traditions of the Army. He might demand that the President make a full
                            report to congress on this matter, especially since a peaceful foreign
                            policy <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0323"/>of the country makes it
                            obviously easy to speak frankly about the very modest state of national
                            armament.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>If you should find it impossible to utilize a member of congress for
                            the above purpose, we suggest that you try using any of your available
                            press contacts. It might perhaps be possible to arrange for an interview
                            of any suitable traveler who happened to have been in Managua on the day
                            of President’s <persName corresp="#p_SGA1">Somoza</persName>’s press
                            conference on the subject and to tie the questions relative to the
                            Guatemalan cigarettes to that interview. Or, if any of the newspapers
                            with whom you are in contact, has a correspondent in Managua, they might
                            ask him (preferably by telephone) to send a special report on the
                            finding of those cigarettes and any other clues which might point,
                            directly or indirectly, to Guatemala.</item>

                        <item>Now this is where the inconsistency comes in: I maintain—so far a
                            priori—that the manifest threat of United States intervention is the
                            sole lever that might conceivably unhinge the allegiance of the “Anti
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Calligeris</persName> faction” to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> regime. Of course,
                            they wouldn’t cotton to the prospect of landing marines any more than to
                            that of invading revolutionaries. But—I maintain—the certain prospect of
                            a unilateral United States move would give them ample food for thought.
                            In an atmosphere of reflection, my message conveying to them an “Easy
                            way out” formula, would be bound to make an impact. In effect they would
                            be offered an opportunity to stave off intervention by the simple
                            expedient of overthrowing the regime and usurping power for themselves.
                            Of course, there would be some weighty political strings attached to our
                            countenancing this shift, but nothing that could possibly be construed
                            as an abridgment of Guatemala’s sovereignty.</item>

                            review of all available facts resulting from the SEMANTIC action and
                            from [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] are studied.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The main premise for any plan from now on should be the build-up of
                            pressures both internal and external on <gloss target="#t_WSBURNT1"
                                >WSBURNT</gloss> both because the internal situation is such that
                            anti-government action should result in continued tension and
                            uncertainty and because there should be fairly quick counter action to
                            avoid any inference that the SEMANTIC episode has caused any
                            problem.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The basic concept for any successful result is that the <gloss
                                target="#t_WSBURNT1">WSBURNT</gloss> army must move against the
                            regime—consequently the major issue is what action is necessary to
                            persuade the appropriate officers to move. It is felt that a carefully
                            integrated large scale action, as originally planned, would clearly
                            produce the result. Due, however, to unforeseen problems in material
                            movement, uncertainties as to the leadership of <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJH1">Calligeris</persName> and possible internal losses
                            via the SEMANTIC episode, the capacity for achieving the integrated plan
                            may have to be unduly delayed or actually substantially changed.
                            Therefore, a different stimulus to produce Army reaction should be
                            planned at least as a contingency alternative.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>The most promising alternative would seem to be the despatching of
                            organizers and RRUS as soon as the effects of the SEMANTIC episode
                            establish the proper method for doing it. Concurrently leaflet drops,
                            specific sabotage and possibly political assassination should be
                            carefully worked out and effected. Moreover, material should be moved
                            into <gloss target="#t_WSBURNT1">WSBURNT</gloss> and cached in all ways
                            possible. The hope would be that this approach might persuade the <pb

                            mentioned, could be assessed. If resistance potential develops, material
                            could be distributed either from internal caches, if developed, or
                            dropped by night flights and action comparable to the original plan
                            undertaken. If early action proves unwise, then a classical longer range
                            resistance build-up can be adopted with a view to action at the first

                                <gloss target="#t_UFCOUNFCUNIFRUIT1">UFCO</gloss> was unfortunately
                            timed since (whatever the merits of the case may be) it lent some
                            credence to the Guatemalan communist-government claim that U.S. policy
                            is being conducted in the interest of the “big capitalists.” Their
                            latest effort, as noted above, to imply that the U.S. would never take
                            such strong actions because of a paltry arms shipment if it were not to
                            exert pressure in the interest of <gloss target="#t_UFCOUNFCUNIFRUIT1"
                                >UFCO</gloss>’s claim for $15 million (or so), is a rather shrewd
                            diversionary maneuver—far superior to the obvious confusion in which the
                            Guatemalan government’s first statements concerning the arms shipment
                            were made—well designed to improve Guatemala’s case on the arms question
                            in the eyes not only of Guatemalan public opinion, but of a major
                            section of world public opinion as well.</item>

                            efforts to frustrate the “anti-imperialist” line of communist political

                            considering the desirability and timing of additional leaflet drops. He
                            explained we might wish to do this at any time and moreover that there
                            might be occasion to use [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] (who have been recruited on an unwitting
                            basis) for certain of these flights. But that the use of such pilots
                            would be reserved for flights involving the use of particularly
                            significant and important pamphlets and where accuracy of delivery is a
                            special requirement. W further stated that the operating headquarters
                            had been directed to explore fully and carefully the possibility of
                            using indigenously procured planes and indigenous pilots for certain of
                            the leaflet drops viz. those of lesser importance and of shorter length,
                            not requiring such deep penetration. H stated that he saw no objection
                            from a policy standpoint. [H recommended that we give further
                            consideration to the use of leaflet rocket bombs especially for the area
                            of the capital city. These are simple devices the release of which is
                            both easy and capable of accomplishment with little risk.]<note n="3"

                                could probably obtain special request. [Footnote in the source

                            do everything we can to procure documentary evidence of the purchase and
                            application for export license. Considered and rejected was the thought
                            of letting the shipment go through and then attempting to waylay it
                            shortly before arrival at destination. This course of action was
                            considered too risky and as involving unnecessary operational
                            difficulties as well as raising more policy problems than the course of

                            Department’s “case” against Guatemala. It was understood that the
                            possibilities of obtaining the documents would be explored by <gloss

                            be advised so that he can clear this with EUR. An important unresolved
                            question in this regard is whether the original documents are required
                            for presentation at the OAS meeting. If the method of obtainment is to
                            be clandestine then it would probably be an embarrassment to present the
                            originals at the meeting, since it would be more <pb n="309"

                        <item>Concerning one very sensitive type of treatment, which was raised
                            directly for the first time by TB in his memo prepared here, H
                            considered this and ruled it out, at least for the immediate future, on
                            the ground that it would probably prove to be counter-productive. This
                            decision was not conclusive and H suggested that he come up with more
                            plans both concerning the individual targets, the timing and the
                            statement of the purpose sought to be achieved with respect to each.
                            This would require a fairly solid showing of the advantage to be gained

                        <item>The petroleum supply situation was discussed at some length and H
                            reaffirmed his decision against efforts prior to the OAS conference to
                            prevail upon the suppliers by means of direct approach to them to delay,
                            slowdown and interrupt shipments. At the same time he approved of and
                            encouraged us to embark upon a carefully selected series of attempts
                            against certain installations. The hope was expressed that if results
                            can be achieved of the right kind, these results might in themselves
                            cause more general benefit by engendering disinclination on the part of
                            suppliers to ship the goods.</item>

                            communist and government media in Guatemala but in communist propaganda
                            everywhere, including virtual daily comments by radio Moscow. The

                            replied in principle yes, and since it was not appropriate to discuss
                            this matter before the group, conferred with Mr. <persName

                                >Holland</persName> would use this in connection with his attempts

                            <item>The government has been trying frantically during the last two
                                weeks to recover the initiative which it had virtually lost
                                before—as had been indicated by the profound effect of Archbishop

                            <item>The government’s initiative consisted primarily of mass arrests
                                and house searches, climaxed by the formal suspension of
                                constitutional liberties—which had been practically disregarded
                                already before (arrests without warrants, people held incommunicado,
                                etc.). At the same time, the communists issued publicly orders for
                                the arming of labor and peasants’ groups, thus admitting their
                                uncertainty as regards the political attitude of the army. In the
                                diplomatic field, the government tried to seize the initiative by
                                offering Honduras a non-aggression pact (an offer which has been
                                turned down in the meantime), by offering direct talks between

                        <item>This piece of <persName>Gruson</persName> reporting is about as
                            harmful as anything he has done. It places the entire emphasis upon the
                            line taken by the (known) Communist-inspired and Communist-organized
                            so-called Guatemalan Friendship Society in Mexico—giving the impression
                            that there is tremendous Mexican sentiment against the US position with
                            respect to Guatemala and implying that the Mexican Government had better
                            watch out if it is thinking about shifting its position in the direction
                            of what the United States wishes.</item>

                            me that if you do plan any further conversation—or if he should contact
                            you again—you might call his attention to this
                                <persName>Gruson</persName> piece and tell him how much we know
                            about the Communist origin of this whole friendship society charade. You
                            could then make the obvious conclusion that <persName>Gruson</persName>,
                            by his <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0359"/>writing, is putting a
                            lot of heavy water on the wheels of this Communist operation and that he
                            must be pretty naive if he is not aware of the significance of his
                                action.<note n="3" xml:id="d182fn3">Because of Agency complaints

                                    dependable source.” He continued: “No doubt there is going on
                                    somewhat of a reign of terror in Guatemala. There is no doubt in
                                    my opinion but what the great majority of the Guatemalan people
                                    have both the desire and the capability of cleaning their own
                                    house. But, of course, those things are difficult to do in face
                                    of the Communist type of terrorism which is manifesting itself
                                    in Guatemala and which is perhaps most dramatically expressed by
                                    the statement of one Communist member of the Guatemalan Congress
                                    that if there was a disturbance, that would mark the beginning
                                    of a beheading of all anti-Communist elements in Guatemala.”

                        it doesn’t happen now, it will. It is a very ticklish point.</p>
                    <p>AWD said he is seeing this morning men from Standard of NJ and they will lay
                        before him their position with regard to the small country down south. AWD
                        besides finding out their position will possibly slow things up without
                        formalized action.</p>
                    <p>The Sec. asked AWD if he thought <persName>Hickenlooper</persName> might
                        introduce some kind of a sanctions bill in the Senate. AWD said it is a good
                        idea, but will have to be phrased very carefully. The Sec. said we have a
                        draft drawn up, but he was not satisfied with it. AWD said it would help
                        their phase, though it would create problems here.</p>

                    <p>On June 17, 1954, at its 202nd meeting, the National Security Council
                        discussed a proposed anti-trust suit against the United Fruit Company, and
                        whether or not to proceed with the suit at the present <pb n="342"
                            xml:id="pg_342" facs="0372"/>time. The Justice Department proposed a
                        settlement but United Fruit continued to insist that the company had done
                        nothing wrong and refused to consider a settlement “unless the Government
                        revealed in advance’ its evidence of violations.</p>
                    <p>Both Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and President
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> saw no reason not to
                        proceed. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added: “on balance it
                        might be positively advantageous to U.S. policy in Latin America if the suit
                        were instituted. Many of the Central American countries were convinced that
                        the sole objective of United States foreign policy was to protect the fruit
                        company. It might be a good idea to go ahead and show them that this was not
                        the case, by instituting the suit.’ The Secretary was, however, concerned
                        that the suit might interfere “with certain activities of the Central
                        Intelligence Agency.”</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DAARA1">Allen Dulles</persName> responded that “given a

                        it.” He also advised a delay of one month “by which time the situation in
                        Guatemala would have been clarified.” (Memorandum of discussion; <persName

                        long haul. It is thus calculated risk but consciously undertaken as
                        providing only present hope of success while if unsuccessful losing nothing
                        of future value.</p>
                    <p>4. Moreover the move will provide evidence of active opposition regime and
                        its inability to maintain its position merely through unopposed police
                        methods.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> launched his attack on
                        June 18, 1954, at 8:20 p.m. after the “National Liberation Committee” had
                        consulted with the “Assembly of the People” the previous evening, according
                        to text prepared by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> for broadcast.
                        In the radio broadcast the people of Guatemala were told: “At this moment,
                        armed groups of our liberation movement are advancing everywhere throughout
                        the country…. The hour of decision has struck.” The message stressed the
                        indigenous nature of the “uprising”: “This is not a foreign intervention,
                        but an uprising of the honest, Christian, freedom-loving people of Guat
                        (sic) to liberate our homeland from the foreign intervention which has
                        already taken place, from control by the Soviet Union which has made Guat an
                        advanced outpost of international commie aggression, from rule by Soviet
                        puppets.” (Telegram from <gloss target="#t_PBSPBSUCCESS1">PBSUCCESS</gloss>

                                his plea for bombing is irrational now that capability to deliver
                                has been convincingly demonstrated. Agree question is not whether
                                his request is rational or moral but whether granting it will
                                actually induce him to move. Must rely heavily your judgment on this

                            Guatemala remains very much in doubt. The controlling factor in the

                            forces, and thus far this group has not given any clear indication of
                            whether it will move, and if so, in which way. If the Guatemalan army

                        <item>The action of <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Colonel Castillo
                                Armas</persName> is not in any sense a conventional military
                            operation. He is dependent for his success not upon the size and
                            strength of the military forces at his disposal but rather upon the
                            possibility that his entry into action will touch off a general uprising
                            against the Guatemalan regime. The forces of Armas entering Guatemala
                            from Honduras are estimated to number about 300 men. These have now been
                            joined by others from inside the country to make a total in excess of
                            600 armed men. (The majority of this number is equipped with rifles,
                            sub-machine guns and 50 mm mortars. These weapons are non-U.S.
                            manufacture.) Armas himself is expected to leave his command post in
                            Honduras today and join one element of his forces near Jutiapa by plane,
                            but thus far there is no word that an airfield has become available.
                            From the command post which he proposes to establish at this location,
                            he will endeavor to coordinate the activities of his other scattered
                            groups throughout the country.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>The entire effort is thus more dependent upon psychological impact
                            rather than actual military strength, although it is upon the ability of
                            the Armas effort to create and maintain for a short time the <hi

                                facs="0391"/>effort primarily depends. The use of a small number of
                            airplanes and the massive use of radio broadcasting are designed to
                            build up and give main support to the impression of Armas’ strength as
                            well as to spread the impression of the regime’s weakness.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>From the foregoing description of the effort it will be seen how
                            important are the aspects of deception and timing. If the effort does
                            not succeed in arousing the other latent forces of resistance within the
                            next period of approximately twenty-four hours, it will probably begin
                            to lose strength.</item>

                    <p>944. 1. May be only our own emotional pendulum, but believe govt, which
                        panicked 18 June, recovered 21 June, getting groggy again. <gloss
                            target="#t_PBPRIME1">PBPRIME</gloss> newsmen say govt reps they deal
                        with show renewed fear, jumpiness. SUMAC Chief of Protocol told press “there
                        is too much fighting going on at Zacapa”, echoing SUMAC view govt cannot
                        stand prolonged tension. Newsmen beginning feel anti-govt forces will win if
                        they combine hanging on in north with dramatic acts in capital.</p>
                    <p>2. Govt not telling people anything. Army communiqués mostly propaganda,
                        contain few facts, political not military in style.</p>
                    <p>3. Feel it significant govt has not tried stage mass rallies. <gloss
                            target="#t_STANDEL1">STANDEL</gloss>, Commies apparently fear take any
                        action precisely among the masses whose support they claim. Also no real
                        evidence workers being armed.</p>
                    <p>4. Have searched without result for signs Commies might be planning
                        desperate, last–ditch stand. Possibility remains, but at present appears
                        more likely alleged die hards will claim they never red when tide has
                        turned.</p>
                    <p>5. General impression is one of spongy, shapeless, gutless govt people. Among
                        these blind, myopic one–eyed man can be boss.</p>
                    <p>6. Where as dramatic strike against capital would have been less useful in
                        last few days, believe time for it, in view forgoing, rapidly coming again.
                        With wounded returning, rumors about front will thrive. If favorable to us,
                        we should reinforce them with air strikes; if unfavorable, we should counter
                        them. Suggest 24 or 25 June.</p>
                    <p>7. Know this hard to believe, but people sitting here like kids watching for
                        4th July firecrackers to go off. The popular imagination is fascinated by
                        the idea of bombs. To people, bombs will signify force majeure, turn of tide

                    <p>Title: <hi rend="italic">Kremlin Coordination of Guatemalan Moves</hi></p>
                    <p>Evidence that the Guatemalan incident is a carefully considered and precisely
                        coordinated Communist thrust at the Americas continues to mount.</p>
                    <p>The evidence that top-flight agents of the Kremlin are guiding all acts both
                        in the field and on the diplomatic front can be found in the fact that
                        events have a way of waiting on other events before they occur, plus the
                        fact that this interlocking of a grand design is not local, but coordinated
                        in all the Republics. This kind of an operation is beyond the scope of any
                        national Communist group.</p>
                    <p>Here are some examples:</p>
                    <p>Not only do the Communists form and finance the Societies of the Friends of
                        Guatemala, they work them like the pawns on a chess board. The entire
                        lecture circuit from Santiago to Mexico City is coordinated; a vote in one
                        society is instantly echoed in another; the wording of resolutions, although
                        seemingly sponsored by men and people thousands of miles away from each
                        other, is often absolutely identical. All these things are the mark of the
                        experienced agent, rather than the political amateur.</p>
                    <p>The same skilled hand can be found on still a higher level, the diplomatic
                        level. Guatemala’s insistence on bringing an American problem before the
                        United Nations’ Security Council is the right of any nation with any
                        problem, but the skill she has displayed in keeping the problem away from
                        the body most capable of handling it––the Organization of American
                        States––shows that there is an overall plan in this department too. Despite
                        the carefully laid plan, it was forced into the open when the Soviet
                        delegate <persName>Tsarapkin</persName> cast the Soviet veto against
                        transferring the Guatemalan charge to the OAS.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday, Americans were treated to a view of the apparatus at work from top
                        to bottom:</p>
                    <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0414"/>
                    <p>Guatemala bypassed the OAS.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union approved her bypassing.</p>
                    <p>The Security Council wanted the OAS.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union cast a veto to see that OAS did not get the problem.</p>
                    <p>That’s only in the past; now look at the pattern working yesterday:</p>
                    <p>Guatemala presses for still another meeting of the Security Council.</p>
                    <p>Even as she presses, pickets are marching in front of the UN headquarters,
                        carrying placards for Guatemala. The pickets organized by the American Peace
                        Crusade, a Communist-front organization.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>Henry Cabot Lodge</persName> agrees that Guatemala
                        should have another meeting of the Security Council.</p>
                    <p>Then comes the one slip of the day—the one which displays the coordination
                        behind all these Communist moves:</p>
                    <p>After—a few minutes after—Ambassador <persName>Lodge</persName> had sent out
                        the call for the new meeting of the Security Council, Soviet delegate
                            <persName>Tsarapkin</persName> put in his own demand for a Council
                        meeting “without delay.”</p>
                    <p>Just a few minutes time and there would have been no need of the
                            <persName>Tsarapkin</persName> demand; just a few minutes time and the
                        world would not have got this first-hand picture of how closely-knit the
                        overall plan is.</p>
                    <p>The hand within the glove had peeped out for just a second, and for a second
                        time—first the veto, and now the demand that the situation be kept within
                        reach of further Soviet vetoes.</p>

                            confusion. He strongly recommends early announcement of evacuation US
                            citizens from Guatemala as measure having profound adverse effect on

                            If he is unconcerned by the threat, he is not really our man. If he is

                            Guatemalan developments in US and foreign press. This distortion made
                            worse by apparent inability or unwillingness grasp true significance
                            these developments plus effects of iron clad press (both foreign and
                            domestic) censorship by Guat Gov’t. <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> cover
                            story this week excellent but almost unique job.</item>
                        <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0421"/>
                        <item>“2. Among distressing reports was an Agence France Presse cable which
                            completely missed the boat and was heavily picked up in Europe chiefly
                            Scandinavia.</item>
                        <item>“3. Because of former association and continued unofficial access to
                            facts and great personal concern over how this whole thing looked in the
                            newspapers, I have done some checking.</item>
                        <item>“4. If you consider advisable would appreciate your conveying
                            following as message from me to <persName>Fernand Moulier</persName>
                            which he can feel free to use in AFP provided no personal or official
                            attribution.</item>
                        <item>“5. The Guatemalan situation is not a banana republic fracas. It is an
                            actual Guatemalan uprising against a Communist regime and Communist
                            apparatus which is definitely linked to Moscow. That link is not a
                            casual ideological or intellectual link—it is an operational link with
                            the plays being called from Moscow both direct and via Mexico literally
                            on an hourly basis.</item>
                        <item>“6. The fact that the revolt apparently started outside Guatemala
                            proper and thereby handed the Communists the word ‘invasion’ on a silver
                            platter is a grave over-simplification. The people involved are in
                            absolute fact Guatemalans who happen to have had to seek sanctuary in
                            fear of their lives outside Guatemalan borders and always wanted
                            return.</item>
                        <item>“7. The ‘invasion’ label has been further emphasized by the apparent
                            loyalty to <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> regime of
                            Guatemalan army. The fact is that defections inside Guatemala have been
                            large scale. So much so that the relatively small band with which Armas
                            crossed the border is now three-to-four times its original size,
                            entirely due to defections within Guatemala. The Guatemalan air force
                            has virtually defected in toto, which accounts for what should have been
                            an intriguing journalistic fact; namely, that no Guatemalan regime
                            planes have been in action against the Armas forces.</item>
                        <item>“8. <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> regime statement
                            that churches have been bombed is completely false. Falsity established
                            by actual eyewitness testimony.</item>
                        <item>“9. Also false is <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>
                            statement that Guatemala City has been bombed. A barracks on outskirts
                            used as an arsenal was bombed but destruction of
                                <persName>Mendoza</persName> House within Guatemala City, which was
                            used by <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> as evidence
                            bombing, was according to several eyewitnesses and neighbors arsoned by
                            regime police in order provide an exhibit.</item>
                        <item>“10. The United Fruit Co. simply does not figure in this thing at all.
                            In fact expect Armas to make public soon his private determination not
                            to allow Fruit Company get away with traditional reactionary policies
                            labor and otherwise.</item>
                        <item>“11. The 2000 ton shipment of Czechoslovak arms shipped via Swedish
                            freighter out of Stettin, with false documents, was no invention. This
                            ten million dollar consignment of arms actually landed in <pb n="392"
                                xml:id="pg_392" facs="0422"/>Guatemala and was taken over by
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> and represents, in
                            relation to the size of the regime military forces, a colossal shipment
                            completely unbalancing the armament equilibrium of that area. This by no
                            means only such procurement of arms by Guatemala.</item>
                        <item>“12. <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> is using part of
                            these weapons to arm Communist-led civilian terror commandos who have
                            received secret instructions to prepare for wholesale civilian massacres
                            when the signal is given. In the meantime <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1"
                                >Arbenz</persName> has publicly announced that he will execute ten
                            hostages for every bomb dropped.</item>
                        <item>“13. Finally, and to repeat, this is a very serious business. The
                            stakes are not the dividends of the United Fruit Company. The stakes are
                            whether or not imperial Communism shall have a tactical command post in
                            Central America within a few miles of the Panama Canal and in position
                            undermine neighboring states. Instead of yelling about Yankee
                            imperialism and invasion the free world should be grateful that a
                            handful of brave but maybe pathetically comical exiles got the pitch and
                            decided decidedto do something about it.”</item>

                        would not fall flat on its face. After discussing the aforementioned with
                        the <gloss target="#t_WH1">WH</gloss> Division they recommended that
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCS1">Wellbank</persName>, presently residing in

                        and guidance.</p>
                    <p>Your attention also is being called to the fact that one of the conditions
                        for [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] to return to the group in

                            <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Calligeris</persName> and adopt a stronger
                        position in controlling him.</p>
                    <p>I feel that our endeavoring to control [<hi rend="italic">name not

                            corresp="#p_CJH1">Calligeris</persName> who undoubtedly will be
                        following all of [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] actions and
                        contacts on a constant basis. Furthermore [<hi rend="italic">name not
                            declassified</hi>] has not indicated any ability to wield influence; on
                        the contrary, he has reached his present position through the process of
                        elimination. We never have had any control over his actions nor has he any
                        reason to be obligated to us at the present time. I recommend strongly that
                        we make up our minds what phase of the govt we are planning to back and
                        follow this course inasmuch as the Latin mind is so suspicious and with such
                        a talent for intrigue that they will perceive immediately our two-pronged
                        device which to them will be very apparent and we will find ourselves in the

                        there is nothing in the middle, and so will really be playing against our
                        own interests. In Latin America you always have two powers: The party that
                        is IN power and the one intriguing to GET IN. We are IN power and I <pb

                                    of a premature D-Day, at the same time hoping that an organized
                                    D-Day could be launched when practicable.</item>

                                <item>Two days before D-Day, the decision to request permission to
                                    go was made. The facts bearing on the case were weighed and the
                                    field decision to request go was made in spite of the fact that
                                    in many cases we could not follow the original plan. One of the
                                    most weighing factors was the belief that the history of failing
                                    organizations is based more on failures to act than on failures
                                    from acting. A report on the factual condition of the situation
                                    was withheld with the realization that if the full situation
                                    were reported, pressure from above <persName>LINCOLN</persName>
                                    might have caused a delay in operations. A firm belief was
                                    shared by all that further delay would only call for a
                                    deteriorating situation.</item>

                        took Esquipulas with no fight. At this point we picked up 400 recruits for

                        to Guatemala City. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] captured

                        party into Gualan, which party became engaged with the opposition. He took
                        the remainder of his forces to support the engagement and after winning, he
                        remained in Gualan. The same day the La Ceiba boat, apparently off course,
                        as they were scheduled to land to a reception party near Santo Tomas, landed
                        above Puerto Barrios and immediately became involved in a fire fight. The
                        exact efficiency of this group can only be determined by the fact that every

                        27 men and grossly exaggerated their size. The last 9 men were captured on
                        the night of the 28th. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] and
                            [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] joined at Vado Hondo.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Calligeris</persName> joined them there, and
                        the FCP moved to Managua. The fighter aircraft ran their first tactical

                        toward the Zacapa area. Air search along the Puerto Barrios–Zacapa corridor
                        was made a daily secondary mission for fighter aircraft from this point
                        forward.</p>
                    <p>On the 25th the Zacapa Garrison counter-attacked Chiquimula. This
                        counter-attack was withstood by a junior officer, [<hi rend="italic">name

                            [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]’s weapons placement and
                        leadership won the day. The Guardia de Honor was reported moving from Ipala
                        toward Quezaltepeque. Air search and opportune flights were run on a
                        continuous basis from this point forward. A small drop was made to a group
                        at Jalapa. Immediately thereafter the recipients attacked the Jalapa
                        Garrison. The air hit four trains full of re-enforcements, destroying 3 of
                        them. Matamoros was hit. El Jicaro bridge was destroyed and the Zacapa to
                        Chiquimula road was strafed and bombed to prevent re-enforcement from
                        Zacapa. Two hundred fifty enemy troops were reported at La Union. Recruits
                        continued to flock to the Liberation Army. The reported strength was 1100 at
                        Chiquimula.</p>
                    <p>On the 26th the Zacapa Garrison again counter-attacked Chiquimula. On the
                        same day our air support surprised them assembling at the line of departure
                        and they were easily routed. The Jalapa group was resupplied and immediately
                        the enemy commander reported that he was under attack by 1500 rebels. It is
                        believed that the appearance and equipping of this group caused the
                        immediate holding up of the Guardia de Honor in its advance into our rear
                        from Ipala to <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0452"/>Quezaltepeque and
                        caused the enemy commander to delay throwing his reserves in at
                        Zacapa-Chiquimula. The air hit the Zacapa marshalling yards, hitting one
                        passenger train carrying troops, hit the Jutiapa bridge and strafed TGW.

                        that TGW went off the air at that time and that Quezaltenango radio shifted
                        frequency to TGW frequency, Quezaltenango radio ostensibly becoming TGW.
                        Through <persName corresp="#p_SGA1">Somoza</persName>, <persName

                        against Jutiapa from Salvador. He was lined up with an air drop which was to
                        occur on the night of the 30th. He was given operation money and dispatched
                        to Salvador to make the arrangements. (Eventually, when the final Junta was
                        formed, <persName corresp="#p_YFGM1">Ydigoras</persName> was informed that
                        he was not to cross the border under any circumstance.)</p>
                    <p>All radios were ordered to concentrate on communications cuts, as evidence
                        was on hand to substantiate the fact that PT/16 was causing confusion, which
                        was counteractable only by phone and telegraph. Proof that the teams must
                        have acted on orders comes from a Guatemalan Army emergency order the
                        following day to protect the lines against the rebels at all costs.</p>

                        back to Chiquimula. The fighter support assigned to hit the tanks at San
                        Jose struck a ship of unknown origin reported by <persName corresp="#p_SGA1"
                            >Somoza</persName> to be carrying arms to Guatemala.</p>
                    <p>On the 28th a 200-man feint was launched at Ipala for the purpose of
                        deception, and at total darkness all forces were pulled down to the road for
                        the final attack on Zacapa. The air that day hit the Zacapa fort, getting
                        secondary explosions, making us believe an ammo dump was hit. Matamoros was
                        bombed again. TGW was strafed and bombed. The Jalapa group was launched
                        toward Zacapa and [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] was
                        resupplied and instructed to move to Zacapa the following morning.</p>
                    <p>On the 29th all ground forces and air support commenced the attack on Zacapa.
                        The advance party entered Zacapa. Zacapa officers were conferred with and

                                a very few. Twenty men can easily think up more things to be done
                                than three men can put into practice. The end result is either a
                                necessary discarding of ideas or a valiant but imperfect
                                implementation of the plans handed down. In this case, because of
                                the loyalty and untiring devotion of KUHOOK field personnel to the
                                proj-ect at hand, the latter case proved true. In the event the

                                        in this writer’s opinion. The first leaflet drop caused the

                            <p>One major factor in the success of shock troop movement and combat
                                was the caliber of unit and sub-unit leaders. Our leaders proved
                                more effective than those of the opposition in the ground skirmishes
                                and in the two major battles engaged in. It is believed that this
                                effectiveness was gained in paramilitary training received under
                                    <gloss target="#t_PBPRIME1">PBPRIME</gloss> direction.</p>
                            <p>In addition to lifting the morale and confidence of the troops, the
                                military efficiency of the unit leaders was shown when the first
                                counterattack against our forces was withstood solely because of a
                                junior officer’s wise weapons’ placement and command presence under
                                fire. Although very seldom in the future will we be able to train
                                hosts of troops when working behind the Iron Curtain, it should be a
                                prerequisite of our KUHOOK programs that we withdraw unit and
                                sub-unit leaders for at least a month’s leadership training. By this
                                means we regain the edge lost through lack of capability to organize

                                    <item>The nature of the fighting was such that unstable
                                        positions, undefinable lines and the fast aircraft being

                            <p>It should be noted here that the sole close air support employed was
                                by a Cessna 180 and by a C–47 circling the combat area with 30 lb.
                                fragmentation bombs and home-made TNT—nail and scrap iron

                            <p>We were not prepared for a tactical communications net. Six tactical
                                radios and the FCP radio occupied a full schedule for the base setup
                                we employed. Team to FCP to team communications at times took 24
                                hours because of staff traffic and blanks in communications due to
                                atmospheric conditions. At times, the round trip traffic was only
                                two hours, but this was not dependable.</p></item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Use of code is impractical in a tactical net, due to the time involved and
                        also due to the garble factor. In this operation certain immediate action
                        messages, FCP to Air Support, were garbled. The most damaging were those in
                        which an error or a garble occurred in coordinates. An intelligent guess by
                        a commo officer or an air operations officer’s surmise as to what was meant
                        does not suffice. Resupply runs were made under just such circumstances when
                        time did not permit cable clarification. In at least one such instance, it
                        is known that the team was on the ground and that the drop occurred 9 miles
                        North of the team area. Usually, garbles were more prevalent when the
                        operator or commander was under fire.</p>
                    <p>Having the agent pads and Chief of Operations separated by radio from air
                        support was a serious error rectified early in the operation. Until
                        rectified, air requests were sometimes received after the ground action had
                        occurred. Allowances had been made for this possibility by placing special
                        air request pads in agent hands with the base pad at air operations, but
                        this left air operations working in the dark as to the ground situation.
                        When rectified, we were able to support the operation more properly.</p>
                    <p>Before rectified, however, we were forced to use voice code using [<hi
                            rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]’s personal communications to
                            [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]. In these cases, at
                        times, 6–8 hours could be cut from the time necessary for an air request to
                        be honored.</p>

                    <p>In every business there is a special group of persons who comprise the
                        “scoffers,” the disbelievers”—men content to bury their complete lack of
                        usefulness under the guise of lack of faith in success.</p>
                    <p>Our organization has its share. Some have drifted from project to project and
                        from division to division—confusing assumed “professionalism” with plain
                        lack of energy or ability to do more than point out weakness in other
                        people’s thinking.</p>
                    <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0456"/>
                    <p>In most cases these people are only dead wood. Usually, their most damage to
                        an operation is confusion of the issue for a short period. However, on this
                        project I can point out four specific instances in which support functions
                        were warned by such characters <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to offer requested
                        support as “this project is doomed to failure.”</p>
                    <p>The possible effects of tolerating such persons in an operational
                        organization are too obvious to list here.</p>
                    <p>It is hoped that this situation can be pointed out to <gloss

                        time, however, to place in the body of this report my personal opinion that

                        duty by <persName corresp="#p_PVC1">Pivall</persName> and it showed up in
                        the results of his work.</p>
                    <p>His professional knowledge and direct manner of dealing with the indigenous
                        personnel gained him, and <gloss target="#t_KUBARK1">KUBARK</gloss>, their

                    <p>In addition, <persName corresp="#p_PVC1">Pivall</persName>’s analytical and

                        recommended that KUHOOK staff consider him for training assignments or a

                        <item>Mr. <persName>Corcoran</persName> then got to what I am sure was the
                            main reason for today’s visit. He said he had never seen anything more
                            ill timed than the announcement of the anti-trust suit against the
                            United Fruit Co. as it weakened their bargaining position with the
                            Hondurans since it was announced prior to the settlement of the strike,
                            and would undoubtedly make things more difficult in Guatemala. He
                            compared the suit against the Fruit Co. at this time with the breaking
                            up of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire when there was nothing good to
                            replace it at the end of World War I. He indicated that the breaking up
                            of the Fruit Co. would leave a chaotic situation. He wanted to know what
                            guidance could be given to Mr. <persName>Montgomery</persName> because
                            of the political importance of all this in Central America, and Mr.
                                <persName>Montgomery</persName> added that <hi rend="italic">he</hi>
                            would like to know if the Fruit Co. were considered expendable. They had
                            heard on the Hill, prior to the uprising in Guatemala, that <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> would bring about the fall of <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> and then see that the blame fell
                            on the Fruit Co. I replied that the first I heard of the anti-trust suit
                            was when I read about it on the front page of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Washington Post</hi>, that nothing had come to me <pb n="431"
                                xml:id="pg_431" facs="0461"/>since, that I was sure <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had nothing to do about it, and I did
                            not believe the Fruit Co. was considered expendable. I asked Mr.
                                <persName>Montgomery</persName> whether he still planned to carry
                            out various of the steps he had promised to make in Guatemala if a
                            democratic government came into power. He replied that such was still
                            his intention, and among other things he had in mind turning over the
                            railroad. However, he did not wish to do this in such a way that
                            everyone would say the Fruit Co. was responsible for the revolution, and
                            that he was awaiting an invitation initiated by <persName

                            Another step would be to give Guatemala an increased share of the
                            profits. I stated that since he was in a frame of mind to be on the
                            giving rather than the collecting end I did not see why he was too
                            concerned about any charges of complicity in the revolution because it
                            would appear more natural, if that were so, for them to be receiving
                            rather than turning over the railroad. I said that there was a recent
                            cartoon (and described the one of 10 days ago) about second chances, and
                            that this seemed the opportunity they had long been waiting for to do
                            things with a reasonable government which we all hoped that of <persName

                            in the Caribbean. Mr. <persName>Corcoran</persName> then said he had not
                            been able to find out who was responsible for the suit, that <persName

                            with it, the Secretary of State said he was not responsible, that others
                            with whom he talked all declined to accept responsibility. I said that I
                            had no idea who was behind it except that I wished to repeat I was quite
                            certain the Agency had nothing to do with it because this was not our
                            business, and that if he wished to discuss the political implications in
                            other countries I felt the proper place to make his facts known was with

                        IN THE GUATEMALAN SITUATION</p>
                    <p>In concert with other departments and agencies and for the purpose of
                        supporting specified foreign policy objectives, the Agency began last
                        November–December 1953 to regroup its limited resources in an effort to meet
                        the growing crisis conditions in Guatemala and neighboring countries.
                        Unfortunately, the sharp cutback in Agency funds and personnel during the
                        summer and fall of 1953 had forced reduction of the already small operations
                        in the area, especially in various smaller countries where the programs
                        amounted to one-man holding operations. Actions taken by the Agency to
                        remedy these deficiencies and to carry out an effective operation may be
                        grouped under three time-periods: the six months prior to the communist arms
                        shipment; the crisis period of May–June; and the current post-crisis
                        period.</p>

                                to concern itself with the communist issue in Guatemala, either
                                regarding the <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> regime
                                as a “home-grown” revolutionary movement dedicated to improving the
                                lot of the exploited Guatemalans, or preferring to dwell on the
                                United Fruit issue and speculate as to United States motives of
                                economic imperialism.</p>
                            <p>In this context our principal information effort was directed toward
                                creating greater awareness throughout the Hemisphere of the real
                                threat to peace and security posed by the verifiable communist
                                penetration of the Guatemalan government. In accordance with
                                established policy at that time, this effort stopped short of
                                accusations, directly attributed to the Agency, against the

                                communist-dominated but did include the preparation and placement of

                                communists, and also labeling certain actions of the Guatemalan
                                government as communist-inspired.</p>
                            <p>Even though Guatemala alone voted against the anti-communist
                                resolution at Caracas, public attention in Latin America did not
                                begin to focus on the issue of communist penetration and resultant
                                threat to <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0463"/>peace and
                                security. With this in mind, the Agency intensified its efforts to
                                get irrefutable evidence publicized throughout the Hemisphere, again
                                short of directly labeling the <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1"

                            the Central Intelligence Agency. A new Public Affairs Officer was
                            appointed and provisions were made for such internal strengthening of
                            personnel and funds as events might require. In order to give direct
                            support to the Guatemalan program, long seriously handicapped in
                            operations through Guatemalan government restrictions, and to help meet
                            the problem of communist penetration in the Central American area, a
                            regional servicing operation was developed whereby USIS Mexico could
                            give program support to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua,
                            Costa Rica, and Panama. This servicing concentrates on anti-communist
                            materials produced by USIS Mexico in direct collaboration with the other
                            posts and tailored to meet specific needs in individual countries. A
                            third phase of organizational build-up was a considerably expanded 1955
                            budget projection, parts of which were to be initiated with 1954 funds,
                            especially the strengthening of the one-man holding operations in the

                    <p>Elsewhere in the Caribbean, and related to the Central American plan, a new

                        made for selected expansion.</p>
                    <p>Media and field operations were directed to intensify their efforts in the
                        collection, preparation, and placement of materials demonstrating communist
                        design on, and penetration of, the Hemisphere. A successful project in
                        January, for example, was the preparation here of a series of articles
                        exposing Guatemalan communists <persName corresp="#p_FJM1"
                            >Fortuny</persName> and <persName>Gutierrez</persName>; these were
                        planted in a Chilean newspaper and later reprinted in selected other
                        countries with Chilean attribution.</p>
                    <p>Throughout this period and on through the crisis itself emphasis was placed
                        on cross-reporting Latin American opinion which opposed the <persName

                        as taken at Caracas.</p>
                    <p>The Agency’s special coverage team at the Caracas Conference fed out a
                        continuous flow of news, backgrounders, photos, and tape recordings,
                        concentrating on the anti-communist resolution and Guatemala’s lone
                        opposition. Through direct Wireless File to all missions and fast pouch
                        these materials were disseminated by all field offices throughout the

                        film documentation was developed on the anti-communist resolution, including

                                Guatemala in mid-May marked a definite turning point: first, among

                                second, elsewhere in the Hemisphere a mixture of surprise, concern
                                and even alarm at this unexpected development; third, elsewhere in
                                the world as the issue became headline news and the communist
                                propaganda network openly took up Guatemala’s cause. Especially
                                significant was the attention given to the problem in Moscow radio
                                broadcasts which from the beginning had been high and became a

                                embarked upon an aggressive information effort, utilizing all
                                available resources, to expose and discredit the <persName

                                communist-dominated, to dramatize the threat to the peace and
                                security of the Hemisphere, and to encourage positive action by
                                other American Republics. This effort included use of direct
                                attribution but continued to emphasize cross-reporting of desirable
                                Latin American opinion. Strong advantage was taken of key
                                developments which helped swing Latin American opinion to our side,
                                such as the Soviet arms delivery and the Guatemalan-Soviet maneuver
                                in the U.N.</p>
                            <p>Output was directed not only to the hemisphere but also to other
                                parts of the world where, because of public unfamiliarity with the
                                Latin American scene, communist propaganda found ready acceptance.
                                Content was aimed at such attitudes as: skepticism or outright
                                disbelief regarding the U.S. position, ranging to public acceptance
                                of allegations that the U.S. engineered the revolution and that U.S.
                                officials had strong financial interests in the United Fruit
                                Company; public rejection of the premise that international
                                communism had in fact subverted the Guatemalan government; reaction
                                in principle to the U.S. stand on searching vessels in American
                                waters and to the U.S. opposition to U.N. Security Council

                            <p>Information treatment was complicated by censorship within Guatemala
                                which, for a period, gave the communist side a distinct advantage in
                                getting out its story first; also by the marked tendency of certain
                                foreign news agencies to cross-report reactions adverse to the U.S.

                        unattributed effort to an aggressive labeling campaign, more than 200
                        articles, backgrounders, and scripts were prepared and transmitted by
                        Wireless File, cable, and fast pouch during four weeks beginning the end of
                        May for press and radio placement abroad. These were developed partly from
                        public sources and partly from declassified intelligence from State and
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. Content ranged from coverage of
                        daily developments in Guatemala, Washington, the UN, and elsewhere in the
                        area, to original verified exposés of communist penetration. Illustrative of
                        numerous pamphlets prepared, a “Chronology of Communism in Guatemala”,
                        written here and printed in Habana in 100,000 copies, was distributed to all
                        posts in Latin America. In addition some 27,000 pieces of anti-communist
                        cartoons and posters were expedited to the field for selective placement.
                        Based on Agency materials WRUL broadcasts were stepped up throughout the
                        crisis period. Newsreel coverage of Guatemala’s action in the U.N. and the
                        emergency OAS meeting were released worldwide. Three special film subjects,
                        including the film “Caracas: Resolution and Reality,” were sent to all posts
                        in the area.</p>
                    <p>Not only posts in this area but selected posts around the world regularly
                        filed back useful stories for cross-reporting together with analyses of
                        local opinion trends. When it became clear from these reports and other
                        sources that censorship inside Guatemala was preventing foreign
                        correspondents from reporting the story, while at the same time Guatemalan
                        and allied sources were pushing their own version of the revolt, the Agency
                        detailed an experienced press officer to Tegucigalpa in Operation <persName
                            corresp="#p_BLJ1">Berry</persName>. This consisted of assembling daily,
                        from intelligence sources, a succinct account of events within Guatemala and
                        forwarding by cable to Embassy Tegucigalpa. The press liaison officer
                        informally passed this information along to selected correspondents.
                        Coverage immediately began to improve, helping also to offset
                        cross-reporting by foreign news agencies of anti-U.S. comment.</p>
                    <p>Field reports now coming in show effective use of materials produced here and
                        by the field posts themselves. Wireless File materials were well received by
                        both metropolitan and provincial papers as <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436"
                            facs="0466"/>timely and effective and were widely printed, frequently
                        without attribution to USIS. This was also true of the anti-communist
                        cartoon prints and plastic plates. Through well-organized mailing lists the
                        various pamphlets and posters were put into the hands of selected
                        individuals and groups. Local radio outlets likewise were successfully
                        brought into play. For example, the important CMQ network in Cuba early in
                        June agreed to use all hard-hitting commentaries on Guatemala at peak
                        listening hours, without USIS attribution. Selected films were redirected to
                        key groups throughout the area, including films exposing communist
                        activities in other countries clearly paralleling the Guatemalan
                        situation.</p>

                    <p>At the present time, the information treatment of the Guatemalan problem has
                        entered the phase of disseminating the documentation only now becoming
                        available from within Guatemala, which confirms the communist nature of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> government and
                        demonstrates the truth of the representations previously made by the United
                        States. In this task, the <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo
                            Armas</persName> government can be expected to help by exposing the
                        atrocities and the tactics of the previous administration. Since this is the
                        first time a communist government has been overthrown, a full case history
                        of “rise and fall” is available, pointedly useful on a sustained basis in
                        arousing Latin America to the methods and dangers of communist penetration.
                        This line is also being carried worldwide to offset the large measure of
                        skepticism which characterizes public reaction to the Guatemalan
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>As part of the basic job of getting verified facts on communist penetration
                        in Guatemala, the Agency detailed two cameramen to Guatemala as soon as it
                        was possible to enter the country. A considerable quantity of sound film
                        documenting communist atrocities is already on hand. Together with other
                        film materials this footage will be developed into two permanent film
                        records on communism in Guatemala, one short subject for immediate
                        theatrical release worldwide and one longer subject for continuing use. A
                        similar effort is being made with regard to still photos and recorded
                        interviews. These and other efforts are in addition to publicizing official
                        statements or reports as they become available for public use.</p>
                    <p>The Agency will continue to give high priority to Guatemala during what
                        undoubtedly will be a long period of rehabilitation. A long-range effort of
                        re-orientation seems indicated, at government levels and particularly in the
                        interior areas where land has been distributed and doubts about the future
                        persist. The Agency desires to play its part in a coordinated multi-Agency
                        effort and has informally exchanged views <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437"
                            facs="0467"/>with the Department of State on the type and size of
                        resources that might be employed.</p>
                    <p>In addition to efforts within Guatemala, there is urgent need for a marked
                        step-up in the information program for the hemisphere, for the two-fold
                        purpose of aggressively exposing communist penetration and bolstering
                        democratic forces. As in efforts directed toward Guatemala, this should be
                        part of a multi-Agency plan of action, bringing to bear on the hemisphere
                        greater attention and larger resources than the U.S. government has given it
                        in the years since the war.</p>

                    <p>A revolt of Guatemalan military cadets disturbed the tentative peace in
                        Guatemala City on August 2, 1954. <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo
                            Armas</persName> viewed the uprising as the precursor of a large-scale
                        army revolt by “unknown forces.” He told Ambassador <persName

                        city in the evening to regroup his liberation forces. (Telegram 116 to the

                    <p>The revolt faltered the same day and order was restored by nightfall. On

                        the National Security Council: “The revolt of the cadets was a natural
                        development from the possibility that the liberation army would secure all
                        the military positions which the cadets had hoped for. Everything was quiet
                        now that both the cadets and the liberation army had been disarmed.”

                    <p>By the beginning of September 1954 all the major documentary sources in
                        Guatemala, including the Foreign Ministry and the Communist Party, had been
                        explored, but few incriminating documents were found. The Station in
                        Guatemala concluded: “All sources agreed Commies and govt. implicated
                        officials either destroyed or personally took out damaging documents. For
                        example, <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Calligeris</persName> advised all Army

                        correspondence.” (Telegram 290 to the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>,
                        September 5, 1954; Central Intelligence Agency, Job 79–01025A, Box 168,
                        Folder 7. See also memorandum dated September 3; ibid., Folder 10)</p>
                    <p>According to a Summary Progress Report dated September 28: “The PBHistory
                        team reviewed more than 500,000 documents, not including several hundred
                        thousand duplicate copies and illegible or semi-destroyed papers and masses
                        of Communist propaganda, books, leaflets, and magazines.” But of that
                        number, only 2,095 were duplicated and a further 50,000 microfilmed. While
                        considering the overall mission a success, the report admitted that “very
                        few” “Communist damaging” documents had been found. (Report attached to
                        dispatch HGG–A–1375 from the Chief of Station in Guatemala to the Chief of
                        the Western Hemisphere Division, October 1; ibid.)</p>
                    <p>Exploitation of the documents included their release to the press. The
                        documents offered were printed by an “unusually cooperative” Guatemalan
                        press, but “the editors made little embellishment of even the most
                        provocative documents, unless suggestions, captions or stories written by
                        the <gloss target="#t_KUGOWN1">KUGOWN</gloss> officer went with the
                        photostatic copy.” (Ibid.) Attempts to publicize the findings throughout
                        Latin America, however, were unsatisfactory. The report noted that only one
                        news service had even carried the initial press release by the Minister of
                        Propaganda. The others “felt the story was not ‘spot’ news, and consequently
                        did not value it to the point of cable traffic.” (Ibid.) The conclusion
                        reached was that the bulk of the documents “may be of value for research

                    <p>In August 1953, the Operations Coordinating Board directed <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to assume responsibility for operations
                        against the <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> regime.
                        Appropriate authorization was issued to permit close and prompt cooperation
                        with the Departments of Defense, State and other Government agencies in
                        order to support the Agency in this task. The plan of operations called for
                        cutting off military aid to Guatemala, increasing aid to its neighbors,
                        exerting diplomatic and economic pressure against <persName
                            corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> and attempts to subvert and or
                        defect Army and political leaders, broad scale psychological warfare and
                        paramilitary actions. During the period August through December 1953 a
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> staff was assembled and operational
                        plans were prepared.</p>
                    <p>Following are the specific operational mechanisms utilized by the Agency in
                        the overall missions against the <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1"

                            <item>Paramilitary Operations. Approximately 85 members of the <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo Armas</persName> group received
                                training in Nicaragua. Thirty were trained in sabotage, six as shock
                                troop leaders and 20 others as support-type personnel. Eighty-nine
                                tons of equipment were prepared. The support of this operation was
                                staged inside the borders of Honduras and Nicaragua. [<hi
                                    rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]
                                There were an estimated 250 men in Honduras and El Salvador for use
                                as shock troops and specialists, outside of the training personnel
                                that had been sent to Nicaragua.</item>

                            <item>Air Operations. The planning for providing air operational support
                                was broken down into three phases; i.e. the initial stockpiling of
                                equipment; the delivering of equipment to advance bases by black
                                flight; and the aerial resupply of troops in the field. Thirty days
                                prior to D-day, a fourth phase, fighter support, was initiated.
                                There were approximately 80 missions flown during the 14–29 June
                                1954 period, by various type aircraft such as C–47’s, F–47’s and
                                Cessnas which were used to discharge cargo, distribute propaganda
                                and for strafing and bombing missions.</item>

                            <item>Clandestine Communications. A clandestine radio broadcasting
                                station was established in Nicaragua. The purpose of these
                                broadcasts was to intimidate members of the Communist Party and
                                public officials <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0479"/>who were
                                sympathetic to the Communist cause. The radio station, prior to
                                D-day, broadcasted programs on why they were on the air; dramatized
                                examples of Communist tyranny; the ideologies and aims of the
                                Liberation Movement and what effect was intended vis-à-vis each
                                individual who was listening; an aggressive program outlining the
                                activities which would ultimately bring down the Communist threat,
                                etc.</item>

                    <p>One of the propaganda ploys was to fabricate reports of Soviet arms
                        deliveries to Guatemala by submarine, and then arranging to have a <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> planted cache of Soviet arms discovered and
                        publicized. The mythical arms deliveries were superseded by the real thing
                        when a ship carrying 2,000 tons of Czech weapons and ammunition arrived.
                        This shipment created an international furor and provided clinching proof of
                        what had been the main <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> propaganda theme,
                        that Guatemala under <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> had
                        become a Soviet satellite.</p>
                    <p>The results of the operational efforts described above were positive, however
                        key Guatemalan Army officers wanted either official assurance of U.S.
                        Government support or an overt military incident which would demonstrate
                            <persName corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo</persName>’s power and
                        determination. On 1 June the <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>
                        regime began a wave of arrests which obliterated <persName
                            corresp="#p_CACC1">Castillo</persName>’s intelligence nets and action
                        assets inside the country and on 8 June a 30-day suspension of all
                        constitutional liberties was announced.</p>
                    <p>On 17–18 June five shock teams trained by the Agency crossed into Guatemala.
                        The turning point came on 25 June when <persName corresp="#p_CACC1"
                            >Castillo</persName>’s forces repulsed a counterattack and later bombed
                        a fortress in Guatemala City.</p>
                    <p>On 27 June <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName> resigned and turned
                        the government over to another Communist, <persName corresp="#p_DCCE1"
                            >Carlos Enrique Diaz</persName>, chief of the armed forces. Following
                        the resignation the Chief of Station and another agency officer held a
                        negotiating session with Guatemalan Army officers. The Agency
                        representatives argued that <persName corresp="#p_DCCE1">Díaz</persName> was
                        unacceptable [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>]. Following assurances from the U.S. Ambassador that
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCE1">Monzón</persName> was indeed the U.S.
                        choice, those present agreed that <persName corresp="#p_MCE1"
                            >Monzón</persName> would be the head of a junta. The agreement soon
                        broke down when <persName corresp="#p_DCCE1">Díaz</persName> doublecrossed
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCE1">Monzón</persName> by appointing him as
                        Minister of Government while <persName corresp="#p_DCCE1">Díaz</persName>
                        retained his position. <persName corresp="#p_DCCE1">Díaz</persName> caved in
                        following bombings by F–47’s.</p>
                    <p>Negotiations took place between <persName corresp="#p_CACC1"
                            >Castillo</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MCE1">Monzón</persName>,
                        President of the Junta, who agreed to accept <persName corresp="#p_CACC1"
                            >Castillo</persName> as a member. In early July <pb n="450"
                            xml:id="pg_450" facs="0480"/><persName corresp="#p_CACC1"
                            >Castillo</persName> became President of the Junta with Major
                            <persName>Enrique Oliva</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MCE1"
                            >Monzón</persName> as the other two members.</p>
                    <p>The budget allocation for this activity was $3,000,000 and the actual cost,
                        less recoverable assets, was just under the original allocation.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Background</hi></p>
                    <p>It was considered that Guatemala represented a serious threat to hemispheric
                        solidarity and to U.S. security in the Caribbean area. Guatemala was ruled
                        by anti-U.S. President <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Jacobo Arbenz
                            Guzman</persName> who was elected to office as a result of fraudulent
                        elections in November 1950. <persName corresp="#p_AGJ1">Arbenz</persName>
                        was supported by a leftist coalition government, with all key positions
                        below the cabinet level thoroughly controlled by a Communist-dominated
                        bureaucracy. The country also maintained the balance of military power in
                        Central America through the army of 7,000 men, the well-trained, hard-core
                        element of which was stationed in Guatemala City. Because of this Communist
                        influence and a hardening anti-U.S. policy, on the part of Guatemala, which
                        was targeted directly against American interests in the country, the U.S.
                        Government was forced to adopt a somewhat firmer attitude toward Guatemala.
                        Based on NSC 144/1 and <gloss target="#t_PSB1">PSB</gloss> policy guidance,
                        the Agency placed top operational priority in an effort to reduce and
                        possibly eliminate Communist power in Guatemala.</p>
