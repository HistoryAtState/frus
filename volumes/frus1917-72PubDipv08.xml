                <head>About the Series</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the Foreign Relations series. The staff of the Office of the
                    Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of the General Editor
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, plans, researches,
                    compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of State Frank B.
                    Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26, 1925. These
                    regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102-138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series, which was signed by
                    President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102-138
                    added a new Title IV to the Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956
                    (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume
                    meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and
                    editing.</p>

                    Series</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations </hi>statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government <pb facs="0005" n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV"/> agencies, departments,
                    and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in foreign policy formulation,
                    execution, or support cooperate with the Department of State historians by
                    providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign policy
                    decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records. Most of the
                    sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have been declassified and
                    are available for review at the National Archives and Record Administration
                    (Archives II), in College Park, Maryland.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and the memoranda of conversations
                    between the President and the Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the
                    files of overseas diplomatic posts. All of the Department’s indexed central
                    files for 1969-1972 are available at Archives II. Almost all of the Department’s
                    decentralized office (or lot) files covering the 1969-1976, period, which the
                    National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred to
                    or are in the process of being transferred from the Department’s custody to
                    Archives II.</p>
                <p>Research for <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes is undertaken
                    through special access to restricted documents maintained and preserved formerly
                    at the Nixon Presidential Material Project at Archives II and currently at the
                    Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library and at other agencies. While all the
                    material printed in this volume has been declassified, some of it is extracted
                    from still-classified documents. The staff of the Nixon Library is processing
                    and declassifying many of the documents used in this volume, but they may not be
                    available in their entirety at the time of publication. Presidential papers
                    maintained and preserved at the Nixon Library include some of the most
                    significant foreign-affairs related documentation from White House offices, the
                    Department of State, and other federal agencies including the National Security
                    Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the
                    Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance <pb facs="0006" n="V" xml:id="pg_V"/> from the General Editor and the
                    Chief of the Editing and Publishing Division. The documents are reproduced as
                    exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are
                    described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed according to
                    accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents within the
                    limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors for
                    each document included in this volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation
                    are retained as found in the original text, except that obvious typographical
                    errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in documents are
                    corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an
                    addition in roman type. Words repeated in telegrams to avoid garbling or provide
                    emphasis are silently corrected. Words and phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the original text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter
                    of each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for
                    declassification purposes have been accounted for and are listed with headings,
                    source notes, and number of pages not declassified in their chronological place.
                    All brackets that appear in the original text are so identified in footnotes.
                    All ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the source of the document,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarized pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provided references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic
                    Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the Foreign Relations statute, reviews records, advises, and makes
                    recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    <pb facs="0007" n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI"/> series. The Advisory Committee monitors
                    the overall compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all
                    aspects of the preparation and declassification of the series. The Advisory
                    Committee does not necessarily review the contents of individual volumes in the
                    series, but it makes recommendations on issues that come to its attention and
                    reviews volumes as it deems necessary to fulfill its advisory and statutory
                    obligations.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act
                    Review</p>
                <p>Under the terms of the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act
                    (PRMPA) of 1974 (44 U.S.C. 2111 note), the Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba
                    Linda, California, has custody of the Nixon Presidential historical materials.
                    The requirements of the PRMPA and implementing regulations govern access to the
                    Nixon Presidential historical materials. The PRMPA and implementing public
                    access regulations require the Nixon Library to review for additional
                    restrictions in order to ensure the protection of privacy rights of former Nixon
                    White House officials, since these officials were not given the opportunity to
                    separate their personal materials from public papers. Thus, the PRMPA and
                    implementing public access regulations require the Nixon Library formally to
                    notify the Nixon Estate and former Nixon White House staff members that the
                    agency is scheduling for public release Nixon White House historical materials.
                    The Nixon Estate and former White House Staff members have 30 days to contest
                    the release of Nixon historical materials in which they were a participant or
                    are mentioned. Further, the PRMPA and implementing regulations require the Nixon
                    Library to segregate and return to the creator of files private and personal
                    materials. All <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes that include
                    materials from the Nixon Library are processed and released in accordance with
                    the PRMPA.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 13526 on Classified National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this vol<pb facs="0008" n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII"/>ume,
                    which began in 2016 and was completed in 2017, resulted in the decision to
                    withhold 0 documents in full, excise a paragraph or more in 0 documents, and
                    make minor excisions of less than a paragraph in 0 documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and editorial notes presented here
                    provide a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of the public diplomacy of the
                    Nixon administration.</p>

                    VIII, Public Diplomacy, 1969–1972</p>
                <p>In 2007, historians at the Office of the Historian proposed a retrospective
                    series of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> (<hi
                        rend="italic">FRUS</hi>) volume designed to augment the series’ coverage of
                    U.S. public diplomacy. While the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> series began to
                    document the subject in a sustained and concerted way starting with the second
                    administration of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Richard M.
                        Nixon</persName>, previous <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> coverage of U.S.
                    public diplomacy efforts have been far less consistent. These retrospective
                    volumes will fill that gap, which stretches from the First World War to the
                    early 1970s. Resource constraints and the statutory requirement to publish <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes 30 years after the events that
                    they cover mean that compilations in this volume have been researched and
                    compiled piecemeal over a longer period of time than the typical <hi
                        rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volume. Fortunately, progress is being made. During
                    the fall of 2014, the Office released the compilation covering the U.S.
                    Government’s public diplomacy efforts from 1917 to 1919. Subsequent
                    compilations, which will document up to the end of the first Nixon
                    administration, will be published as they are completed.</p>
                <p>This compilation, covering the years 1969 to 1972, focuses on the Nixon
                    administration’s efforts to manage public diplomacy during <persName
                        corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName>’s first term in office. It describes how
                    the United States Information Agency (<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>)
                    worked to present U.S. foreign policy objectives to the world during a time of
                    social change within the United States and how <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                        >USIA</gloss> attempted to reach new audiences, specifically young adults.
                    The volume chronicles the development of new structures within <gloss
                        target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, including the Executive Committee (ExComm)
                    and the Young Officers’ Policy Panel (<gloss target="#t_YOPP_1">YOPP</gloss>).
                    It depicts how the Agency commemorated the Apollo 11 moon landing, took part in
                    the Women’s Strike for Equality, and planned for the U.S. Bicentennial
                    celebration. The compilation also illustrates how <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                        >USIA</gloss> and the Department of State pursued public diplomacy against
                    the backdrop of the Vietnam war, the President’s 1972 trip to China, and the
                    1972 Moscow summit. Additional documentation chronicles the Department of
                    State’s cultural exchange activities, including administration of the Art in
                    Embassies program and the Cultural Presentations program. The volume should be
                    read in conjunction with <ref target="frus1969-76v38p2"><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The Presidential papers of <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Richard M.
                        Nixon</persName>, housed at the Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library and
                    formally housed at the National Archives and Records Administration, are a key
                    source of high-level decision making documentation on public diplomacy. A number
                    of collections are relevant to research in this area. Within the National
                    Security Council Files, the most useful collections are the Agency Files,
                    Subject Files, Name Files, Haig Chronological File, and the Kissinger Telephone
                    Conversation transcripts. </p>
                <p>The National Archives and Records Administration also houses essential high-level
                    documentation on the implementation and management of public diplomacy during
                    the Nixon administration. Within the Department of State Record Group 59, the
                    records of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs are especially
                    significant, as they contain the files of the Assistant Secretary of State for
                    Educational and Cultural Affairs as well as the records of the Advisory
                    Commission on International Educational and Cultural Affairs. In addition, the
                    Subject-Numeric Indexed Central Files for 1967-1969 and 1970-1973 include a
                    variety of documentation on cultural programming and educational and cultural
                    exchanges. Of great importance is Record Group 306, the records of the United
                    States Information Agency. These collections yield a substantial amount of
                    documentation on <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s organizational
                    structure, as well as on program development, implementation, and evaluation.
                    The <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Historical Collection includes
                    Subject Files (containing records relating to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                        >USIA</gloss> function, mission, organization, and programs compiled by
                    former <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> archivist Martin Manning), Office
                    of the Director Files (containing biographical material on <gloss
                        target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> senior personnel and major speeches), and
                    Reports and Studies Files. The Records of the Office of Policy and Plans contain
                    both subject files and general subject files. The Office of the Director Files
                    (separate from those contained within the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                    Historical Collection) also include detailed subject files. The Office of
                    Research files contain a variety of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                    printed products, including the Research Reports and the Special Reports. The
                    Office of Research and Evaluation files contain program files, while the Office
                    of Research and Assessment files include documentation relating to the Advisory
                    Commission on Information and the Advisory Commission on International
                    Educational and Cultural Affairs.</p>

                            is Volume I. In a November 19, 1968, memorandum to agency officials,
                                <persName corresp="#p_PB_1">Posner</persName> indicated that the
                            briefing book consisted of information provided by “all Agency Elements”
                            regarding “policy and program issues.” He continued: “As anticipated,
                            changes in the world situation and the passage of time may make it
                            necessary to up-date some of the materials. We are prepared to make such
                            changes as elements, in their judgment, consider necessary to present a
                            current picture of Agency problems and conditions.” (Ibid.; INF 14–1

                        Concern</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. The Transfer of Power</p>
                    <p>A deliberate effort will be necessary to demonstrate to the world the process
                        of orderly transition. Such an effort could help offset any sense of hiatus
                        which might generate anxiety in countries relying on U.S. support, or
                        encourage adversaries to act on a presumed wavering in the U.S. resolve to
                        honor commitments of the past. The newly elected leadership should give
                        public assurance that, while it prepares to review U.S. foreign policy, it
                        will not unilaterally abandon or curtail any commitment affecting the rest
                        of the world. An early statement of cardinal principles would have an
                        excellent effect.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. The New Leadership</p>
                    <p>A comparable effort will be required to project the new leadership—President,
                        Vice President and cabinet officers as they are announced. After the
                        divisiveness of the campaign much of which was reflected in editorials
                        abroad, steps must be taken to develop sympathetic understanding and support
                        for the new personalities on the part of opinion leaders abroad.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Viet-Nam</p>
                    <p>This will probably continue to be the number one priority problem. Any of the
                        alternatives—escalation, withdrawal, or even a break-off of the Paris Peace
                            Talks<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2">The Paris Peace Talks, with

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. World Opinion and the Current Domestic Scene</p>
                    <p>Many foreign observers see the U.S. as torn by internal conflicts, between
                        whites and blacks, rich and poor, old and young. They see these conflicts
                        producing violence in a country already prone to violence. Commentators
                        speak frequently of the U.S. tradition of frontier violence and the use of
                        guns to settle disputes; in describing present conditions, they fall back on
                        the terms “malaise” and “sick society.” The general response is one of
                        anxiety, the prognosis varying widely between friendly and hostile critics.
                        Strong statements by the new U.S. leadership putting the situation in
                        perspective would be helpful with foreign audiences.</p>

                        Attention Within the Next Twelve Months</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Free World Opinion and the U.S. Role in World
                        Affairs</p>
                    <p>There is growing fear that the U.S., troubled by domestic problems and weary
                        of the costly Viet-Nam war, is ready to turn away from its far-reaching
                        international commitments. Talk of a possible neo-isolationism is
                        widespread. Hence the need for reassurance by the new leadership that—while
                        the U.S. will modify its policies as changing circumstances require—there is
                        a basic constancy in the U.S. participation in the world community of
                        nations.</p>

                    <p>As a corollary to point #1 above, an early reaffirmation of U.S. support to
                        the United Nations would have a salutary effect on world opinion. It should
                        include tangible evidence of U.S. commitment to the U.N., possibly in the
                        form of concrete suggestions on U.N. peacekeeping machinery or initiatives
                        in the disarmament field. And it should include reiteration of the
                        traditional U.S. support for the development of international law.</p>

                    <p>Another area for high priority attention is the relationship of the U.S. to
                        the developing world. Cuts in the foreign aid program and indications of a
                        trend toward protectionism provide a backdrop for deep questioning about
                        U.S. intentions. A major statement of the policy of the new administration,
                        early in 1969, could do much to clear the air.</p>

                    <p>The development of chemical-biological weapons and their potential use are
                        getting increasing public attention both at home and abroad. The question
                        may pose a psychological problem comparable to—though not so great as—the
                        problem of nuclear weapons. Again, psychological factors are a vital element
                        to be considered.</p>

                    <p>A serious and continuing problem is to assure world opinion of U.S. strength
                        to deter aggression and simultaneously of our dedication to peace. A
                        delicate balance must be maintained. Suggestions were made above for
                        reiterating the U.S. military commitment in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss>. At the same time, we must recognize that much of the
                        world, reacting emotionally to the situation in Viet-Nam, sees U.S. action
                        there as warlike and needlessly destructive. Hence the need also to
                        dramatize our deep national commitment to peace. This might be done through
                        new U.S. initiatives in the U.N.; through greater emphasis on disarmament
                        and arms control (exploiting the Disarmament Agency as an important symbol
                        of our practical aspirations for peace); through identifying the U.S.
                        tangibly with the search for solutions to the great common problems such as
                        health, education, and increased food production.</p>

                        “practical, powerful resource in enhancing our image abroad.”</p>
                    <p>“Truth has put America far ahead in the contest of ideas; let us keep her
                        there,” he said, adding:</p>
                    <p>“For those who, in troubled times, might doubt the wisdom of reporting the
                        bad in America along with the good, I offer two arguments <pb facs="0059"
                            n="7" xml:id="pg_7"/> against diluting the truth: first, from an open
                        society today, news radiates immediately to all parts of the world, and we
                        can be certain our enemies will emphasize and exaggerate the unfavorable.
                        Obviously, then, it behooves us to tell the whole story, but to give it
                        balance and perspective and depth, something which our detractors and the
                        commercial news media cannot be expected to do.</p>
                    <p>“Second, it is my conviction that the full news—the whole truth—from America
                        adds up to a positive, creditable and appealing picture. What we, in the
                        myopia of our daily pursuits, may regard as disturbing national problems can
                        be interpreted in proper perspective as challenges which a dynamic and
                        self-confident people expect to take in their stride. . .</p>
                    <p>“Today it does matter that Americans be regarded abroad as citizens of a
                        mature, responsible and right-minded society. This is a proper concern of
                        the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> information and cultural
                        programs—not to compete with the established media, but expertly to
                        supplement their output abroad. Headlines highlight the news of the moment.
                        It is <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s task to add balance and
                        perspective.”</p>

                    <p>Foreign and domestic policies are inextricably interwoven; indeed, it is
                        difficult to tell in many cases which is the warp and which the woof in the
                        fabric of our society. Of one thing, however, we can be certain. Each
                        influences the other. In short, we have problems at home and overseas. This
                        nation must engage in its problem solving—in part because we still have a
                        “decent respect to the opinions of mankind.”<note n="2" xml:id="d3fn2"
                            >Reference is to the Declaration of Independence.</note> Our information
                        and educational exchange programs are a manifestation of this continuing
                        respect.</p>
                    <p>In this, our Sixth Annual Report to Congress, we cannot dwell on the domestic
                        problems of riots and racism, ghettoes and transit systems, education and
                        urbanization. But we must recognize at the outset that the solutions to
                        these problems will make ever-increasing demands on the public purse and
                        hence may have a profound effect on international programs.</p>
                    <p>There are no quiet places in the world today. The nation must not deceive
                        itself into thinking that even when a peaceful and honorable settlement is
                        achieved in Viet-Nam, we shall be free of foreign entanglements, and our
                        frustrations with foreign affairs at an end. Still we must not let these
                        frustrations turn our attention from our real and permanent responsibilities
                        as we respond with our manifold international programs. In particular, this
                        Commission’s main concern is that there must be no further eroding of
                        programs of international educational and <pb facs="0061" n="9"
                            xml:id="pg_9"/> cultural exchange as a result of the general feelings of
                        frustration with things international. We assume that after 30 years of
                        Government-supported educational and cultural relations, this nation is
                        committed to such programs. If it is not, it should be.</p>
                    <p>In any case, the faith of this Commission remains steadfast in the
                        Government’s educational and cultural exchange programs as one way of
                        letting other nations witness our problem-solving and one significant
                        opportunity for cooperation with other peoples. And so it should. There has
                        recently been called to our attention a series of letters from 105
                        ambassadors and chargés d’affaires around the world. An analysis of these
                        letters shows that it is the overwhelming consensus of these U.S. mission
                        heads that the educational and cultural programs—</p>
                    <p>(1) Are an effective and significant element in our long-term foreign
                        relations with virtually every country replying. (The force and conviction
                        of the statements, many of them from veteran ambassadors, are striking.)</p>
                    <p>(2) Are an effective and essential tool to reach and inform national
                        intellectual and political leaders, and the press and other information
                        media on American character and policies.</p>
                    <p>(3) Have effectively contributed to removing misconceptions about, and
                        hostility to, the United States and its social, economic, and cultural
                        achievements; and, as a corollary, to offsetting pro-Communist propaganda
                        and predilections.</p>
                    <p>(4) Have significantly helped to develop education and to introduce new
                        educational approaches in many countries, with particular reference to the
                        developing nations.</p>
                    <p>(5) Provide an invaluable means for keeping channels of communication open in
                        both directions at times when and places where political tensions or
                        hostility block official diplomatic relationships.</p>
                    <p>(6) Are a significant method of reaching young people—especially potential
                        leaders in the emerging countries and the “new generation” which has come up
                        in Europe and elsewhere with little recollection of World War II and few
                        post-war associations with the United States.</p>
                    <p>Specific examples of effectiveness cited in the letters are many and
                        persuasive, namely:</p>
                    <p>(1) In most countries with long-standing exchange programs, an impressive
                        number of key people today at very high levels—in political and public life,
                        in press and information circles, and in education—are former grantees.</p>
                    <p>(2) In emerging countries the programs have been markedly successful in
                        selecting leaders and potential leaders.</p>
                    <p>(3) Strong, fruitful, and continuing relationships have been established,
                        through the exchange programs, with educational institutions, educational
                        policymakers, professors, and teachers</p>
                    <pb facs="0062" n="10" xml:id="pg_10"/>
                    <p>(4) The exchange programs have been a successful means of introducing
                        American studies abroad, especially in Europe, and of acquainting teachers
                        with the United States and its educational system.</p>
                    <p>This is not to say that these programs are perfect or that the ambassadors
                        had no criticism of them. On the other hand, it is difficult indeed to state
                        precisely what an ideal educational exchange program would be, just as it is
                        impossible for an educator to state what the ideal curriculum in any subject
                        is.</p>

                        and delegating authority under it to various Government departments and
                        agencies, the President reserved unto himself the right to receive
                        recommendations from the Commission. We intend, therefore, to transmit to
                        the President a copy of this annual report to the Congress.</p>
                    <p>We recommend:</p>
                    <p>(1) That the President personally and vigorously identify to the American
                        people and to Congress the crucial importance of international educational
                        and cultural programs and that he give continuous support to such programs
                        as a vital part of U.S. foreign relations and an indispensable sector of the
                        infrastructure of U.S. foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>(2) That the President establish an organizational structure within the
                        executive branch which will assure consistent and purposeful national action
                        in international educational and cultural affairs.</p>
                    <p>Some questions which would be answered in the implementation of these
                        recommendations are listed below:</p>
                    <p>What administrative pattern, both in Washington and in the field, can best
                        facilitate the Government’s performance of its role? Should all educational
                        and cultural activities supported by Government be directed by one agency,
                        or should they be dispersed among various agencies; and if the latter, how
                        can they be effectively coordinated? And how should the administration of
                        educational and cultural activities <pb facs="0063" n="11" xml:id="pg_11"/>
                        be related to that of similar activities such as economic development
                        assistance or trade?</p>
                    <p>To what extent should the international cultural programs of the United
                        States be deliberately related to those of other countries, and should this
                        be done primarily through multilateral means or through bilateral,
                        reciprocal means? For that matter, to what extent <hi rend="italic">can</hi>
                        cultural relations be made genuinely reciprocal?</p>
                    <p>What should be the magnitude of an adequate educational and cultural
                        relations program, and what should be the relative magnitude of each of its
                        component parts?</p>
                    <p>These questions, and many others like them, have been the subjects of
                        discussions in innumerable studies, reports, conference sessions, and
                        congressional hearings, as a conscious search for overall policy has
                        developed and become increasingly insistent.</p>
                    <p>Underlying all these questions, and in a sense conditioning the answers to
                        all of them, is the fundamental question: <hi rend="italic">How can
                            educational and cultural programs contribute to the advancement of the
                            basic objectives of U.S. foreign policy</hi>?</p>
                    <p>If the recommendations and the questions listed above seem familiar, so they
                        should. The recommendations are taken almost verbatim from a report of 1961

                        commitment to international educational and cultural exchange. If we choose
                        not to, let us say so. If we are committed, let us begin to move

                    <p>In short:</p>
                    <p>1. We reaffirm our belief that the educational and cultural exchange programs
                        of the Government have been and continue to be a success by any
                        measurement.</p>
                    <p>2. We assert that these programs and their place in the Government deserve
                        Presidential attention as one of the most important aspects of our foreign
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>3. It follows, then, that we feel the programs should be properly funded in
                        terms of the foreign policy-oriented purposes which underlie them. By this
                        we mean that the Congress should provide each year sufficient money to
                        maintain and improve such ongoing programs as the teaching of English as a
                        second language and American studies overseas as an integral part of a
                        comprehensive cultural and educational relations program. We would leave to
                        the judgment of the operators the exact amount to be requested each year,
                        but surely the amounts must not fluctuate over the decades as they have in
                        the past. These fluctuations, it seems to us, show the lack of a firm belief
                        in Government-sponsored international educational and cultural programs
                        which is simply unbecoming a great nation.</p>
                    <p>4. We repeat our <hi rend="italic">recommendation</hi> that the International
                        Education Act<note n="6" xml:id="d3fn6">Presumable reference to the
                            International Education Act of 1966 (P.L. 89–698; 80 <gloss
                                target="#t_Stat_1">Stat.</gloss> 1066), which <persName
                                corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> signed into law during a
                            ceremony at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok on October 29, 1966.
                            Additional documentation regarding the act is scheduled for publication
                            in <ref target="frus1917-72PubDipv07"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                    Relations</hi>, 1917–1972, vol. VII, Public Diplomacy,
                                1964–1968</ref>.</note> be funded as soon as possible and to the
                        extent feasible. Congress has authorized appropriations. It is time they
                        were made. The funding of this act will provide an educated and informed
                        generation which the country cannot afford to be without.</p>
                    <p>5. We intend to continue the dialog with our sister commission, the U.S.
                        Advisory Commission on Information, so that we may discuss in greater detail
                        the subjects that have already been broached in the meetings that we have
                        had.</p>
                    <p>6. We call upon the President and Secretary of State to seek the Advisory
                        Commission’s advice to a greater extent than previously. We feel that we are
                        knowledgeable about many of the problems in this field.</p>
                    <p>7. We feel that there must be a permanent evaluation staff for these programs
                        so that the Department will know of successes achieved or problems
                        encountered year in and year out and can thus constantly improve the
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>8. We feel especially strongly that after 30 years of Government-sponsored
                        educational and cultural programs overseas it is time that <pb facs="0065"
                            n="13" xml:id="pg_13"/> the Government and the nation, too, decide in
                        what agency these programs are to be located, how and to what extent they
                        are to be supported, and how their relationship to domestic international
                        educational and cultural programs, to information and propaganda, and to
                        intelligence gathering are to be ordered in the whole complex of Government
                        agencies.</p>

                        his prospects for dealing with them? Have their views changed since the

                        they expect him to do with respect to their countries and other areas of the
                        world?</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this study is to supply at least tentative answers to these
                        questions. It is based on an examination of foreign media content, reports
                        from U.S. diplomatic posts abroad and available survey research. It is
                        focused mainly on the period from the November 5 election to the week
                        following the Inaugural Address. Views expressed in communist countries are
                        treated separately at the end of the study.</p>
                    <p>There are a few generalizations that can be drawn from the study (none very
                        surprising).</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">First</hi>, President <persName corresp="#p_NP_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> is very widely seen as a pragmatic, professional,
                        highly experienced political leader. Words like “firm,” “serious,” “hard
                        lining,” “anti-communist” are frequently used to describe him, as are
                        “cautious,” “middle of the roader,” and sometimes “courageous.” In contrast
                        to descriptions of past Presidents and Presidential candidates, such words
                        as “idealistic,” “innovative,” “charismatic,” are virtually absent, nor is
                        the description “<persName corresp="#p_EDD_1">Eisenhower</persName>
                        Republican” often used. There are indications, however, that the tone and
                        substance of the Inaugural Address have led to a blurring of the earlier
                        image. Some commentators seem less certain that former characterizations
                        such as <pb facs="0067" n="15" xml:id="pg_15"/> “hard liner” hold true. For
                        example, a conservative Japanese newspaper predicted after the election that
                        the Nixon administration would favor the use of force. After the Inaugural,
                        it asserted that the Address’s calm and moderate tone indicated the
                        emergence of a new <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName>.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, across the spectrum of comment from friendly
                        to hostile, there are no widely accepted predictions of profound changes in
                        U.S. domestic or foreign policies. Possible shifts in attention from foreign
                        to domestic concerns or from Asia to Europe are often foreseen. But these
                        shifts are not expected to be drastic. Some West European left-intellectual
                        commentators predict the new Administration will not pay sufficient
                        attention to problems of youth and the poor. In Africa, some expect Black
                        America will be paid less heed.</p>
                    <p>The perceived catalog of U.S. problems remains unchanged: Viet-Nam, the
                        Middle East, superpower relations, arms limitation, the alliance system, aid
                        to the underdeveloped nations, the world monetary system, domestic
                        inflation, civil unrest, racial strife. As before, awareness and
                        interpretations of these problems, the importance attached to them, and
                        prescriptions offered for their solution vary enormously.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, expressions of confidence in the new
                        Administration’s capacity to deal with foreign and domestic problems tend to
                        vary both according to geographic area and political orientation. West
                        Europeans tend to see the choices open to the new Administration as limited
                        by prior commitments, domestic preoccupations and the world situation. Right
                        and center European opinion appear to have more confidence in the
                        Administration’s abilities. It is notable that some “independent” opinion
                        leaders such as the <hi rend="italic">London Times</hi> are cautiously
                        optimistic. By contrast, liberal to left opinion is more skeptical.</p>
                    <p>In other areas of the world—Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Middle
                        East—there appears to be far less awareness that the range of choice is
                        limited. Emphasis is not on the capacity of the Administration to resolve
                        problems but on its will to bestow or withhold attention and favor.</p>
                    <p>In East Asia most concern is focused on continued American resistance to
                        communist expansion, although Japanese opinion is somewhat preoccupied with
                        future trade relations. Opinion in the Arab world is totally preoccupied
                        with the new Administration’s intentions in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
                        Similarly, some Israeli commentators dwell on prospects for diminished U.S.
                        support while others hopefully predict no change. Indian comment often
                        indicates that the measure of the new Administration will be its aid program
                        while Pakistani opinion sees settlement of the Viet-Nam War and reduction of
                        East-West tension as criteria of success. In Latin America, commentators
                        concentrate on the hope for increased U.S. interest, attention and aid and
                        the fear of U.S. neglect. In Africa, too, aid and interest are often seen as
                        the yardsticks against which the new Administration will be measured.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi>, there is a pronounced tendency among
                        commentators in most countries to seek indications that relations with the

                    <p>R just heard that Frank Shakesphere was taking a trip to Beirut or someplace
                        like that and has his doubts about whether this is a good move. They might
                        think we have some sort of plan by sending Shakesphere.</p>

                        Center in which representatives of advanced nations on both sides of the
                        curtain might work together on some common problems of industrialized
                        societies. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Bundy</persName> held extensive
                        discussions with business and academic leaders here and abroad, and came up
                        with a proposal for an East/West Center, manned by academicians, scientists,
                        etc., from both East and West. The general purposes of the Center would be
                        to:</p>
                    <p>—study common problems of organization and management in fields such as
                        communications, urban organization, economic and industrial development,
                        higher education, and resource use;</p>
                    <p>—apply analytic techniques to these problems.</p>
                    <pb facs="0071" n="19" xml:id="pg_19"/>
                    <p>The U.S. share of annual expenses for the Center should not exceed $2.5
                        million. The over-all cost of the Center, including a core staff and
                        provision for special subjects, might be as high as $5 million, but U.S.
                        participation would not exceed 50% at a maximum, and ought to be kept at 40%
                        if possible. (Consultation with Congressional leaders has indicated that
                        they would be willing to go along with this level of expense.)</p>
                    <p>If the project is to stay alive, there needs to be some indication that you
                        are favorably disposed to studying it further, and all you would need to do
                        is mention to <persName corresp="#p_WH_1">Wilson</persName> that you are
                        still considering it.</p>
                    <p>My own feeling is that this is a project worth continuing. The cost is small
                        and the possible benefits fairly large.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. Its purpose is to bring the
                        insights of the Agency’s young generation to bear more actively on our
                        problems. I also hope that it will serve to give our young officers a
                        greater sense of participation in our common tasks.</p>
                    <p>The Panel will be composed of about a dozen young officers of the foreign and
                        domestic services. Members will be appointed for a year and serve on a
                        rotating basis. Their regular assignments will allow for a degree of
                        flexibility in working hours in order to enable them to participate in Panel
                        activities.</p>
                    <p>The Panel will report to the Deputy Director (Policy and Research).<note

                            leadership decided to remove the research function from the Office of
                            Policy and Research and establish an Office of Research and Assessment,
                            containing divisions and units from the Office of Policy and Research,
                            the Office of the Director, and Office of the Assistant Director for
                            Administration. At the time of this memorandum, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RHA_1">Ryan</persName> served as the Deputy Director for

                            assumed the position of Associate Director for Research and Assessment,
                            of the newly-created Office of Research and Assessment, in mid 1969. For
                            additional information, see <ref target="#d16">Document 16</ref>.</note>
                        I expect to meet with the group myself at an early date, and thereafter as
                        time permits.</p>
                    <p>The responsibilities of the Panel will be of three principal types:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">To receive and screen the ideas of all young
                            officers</hi> so that the best of these ideas may be transmitted to
                        Agency elements for action.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">To arrange for other young Agency officers to
                            participate in activities through which they can broaden their outlook
                            and contribute to Agency thinking and decision-making</hi>. These
                        activities wil include:</p>
                    <p>a. Attendance at debriefings of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and

                        productions and acquisitions;</p>

                            >PPBS</gloss> Working Group);</p>
                    <p>f. Campus recruiting.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">To keep open the Agency’s lines of communication with
                            college students and their organizations</hi>, and bring the insights
                        gained to bear on Agency policies, products, and programs. Panel members
                        will meet and correspond with student groups, and as a result of these
                        contacts will, for instance:</p>
                    <p>a. Make recommendations on Agency policies and plans;</p>
                    <p>b. Make suggestions for new Agency media products and field activities;</p>
                    <p>c. Select magazine reprints and other items for a quarterly youth packet,

                            of the meeting has been found.</note> an Executive Committee has been
                        established to advise the Director and the Deputy Director on major
                        questions regarding the use of Agency resources. The Committee will thus
                        replace the Program Review Committee and the system previously in effect for
                        media content decisions.</p>
                    <p>The Committee will initially be composed of:</p>
                    <p>Deputy Director, Chairman</p>
                    <p>Deputy Director (Policy and Research)</p>
                    <p>Assistant Director (Administration)</p>
                    <p>An Executive Secretary</p>
                    <p>Pending the appointment of the permanent Executive Secretary, papers should
                        be submitted to the Committee through ICP.</p>
                    <pb facs="0075" n="23" xml:id="pg_23"/>
                    <p>The Committee will meet as often as necessary and at least twice a week for
                        the immediate future. The initial schedule will provide for meetings on
                        Monday at 11:30 AM and on Thursday at 9:30 AM.</p>
                    <p>Any Agency element may submit any matter for the Committee’s consideration
                        that it deems appropriate. The Committee will also review subjects on its
                        own initiative. All parts of the Agency that have an interest in a subject
                        will be invited to submit their views.</p>
                    <p>The Committee, as it begins to function, will develop procedures to ensure
                        adequate staff work and expeditious handling of its business. Attached are
                        interim instructions for the submission of proposals.<note n="3"

                            proposal. The interim instructions read, in part: “The Committee will
                            consider a proposal only after full staff work has been completed,
                            permitting a thorough analysis of all pertinent data, including possible
                            alternatives. At the same time, it is important that items requiring
                            priority attention be identified and expedited, so that the Committee
                            may make decisions as promptly as required.” In an April 23 memorandum

                            fully coordinated with other elements involved, or omitted pertinent
                            information.” <persName corresp="#p_OJR_1">O’Brien</persName> attached
                            guidelines and a summary sheet, indicating that they replaced the March

                            28. The proposal outlined the coverage and handling of the Apollo 11
                            mission, scheduled to launch in July, listing approved projects, those
                            in preparation, and others under examination.</note> He pointed out the
                        need for keeping under review contingency planning in connection with Apollo

                            in which the astronauts in Houston (either during their quarantine
                            period or immediately after) would discuss their experiences via
                            satellite hookup with young people on all continents. One or two young
                            people speaking in the presence of a young studio audience would
                            participate from each location. The Agency would have to work this out
                            with U.S. and foreign networks and could probably recuperate some of the
                            costs. The dramatic use of space satellites in marking the first major
                            milestone in the exploration of space would be highly symbolic. So would
                            be also the concept of the first ‘envoys of mankind to the moon’
                            reporting to representatives of the ‘space generation’ of all mankind.
                            Total costs of such a telecast are estimated at $85,000 for a one-hour
                            show (including preparatory travel by the producer), but it will require
                            much preliminary work to find out what the actual cost that the Agency
                            itself would have to bear would be. For this preliminary work, the
                            Executive Committee’s approval of the project in principle is required.”

                    </list>
                    <p>I should like to propose that the President proclaim an annual AFRICA DAY, in
                        recognition of the special ties of heritage and culture which the U.S.
                        shares with the nations of Africa. The suggested date would be May 25, the
                        day on which the Organization of African Unity was instituted in 1963. This
                        is the only date which has virtual universal common significance for all
                        independent African-governed states, selection of that date would indicate
                        U.S. recognition and respect for the concepts of practical initiative toward
                        progress and spirit of common identity—both of which are embodied in the
                            <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the proclamation of a U.S. national AFRICA DAY would have
                        important beneficial effects, both immediate and long-range, on the
                        psychological climate which conditions U.S.-African relations. Such a step
                        would constitute formal, prideful acknowledgement of the unique relationship
                        existing between Americans and Africans . . . which the latter share with
                        the people of no other major power. Such a gesture would be particularly
                        useful at this time, where there is a deep-seated suspicion that the U.S. is
                        losing interest in Africa.</p>
                    <p>Although domestic considerations are not our concern, it is suggested that
                        the act of establishing AFRICA DAY would have considerable symbolic
                        importance as a measurement of the concern and respect felt by the
                        Administration for the heritage and special identity of Black Americans.</p>
                    <p>It is also to be pointed out that this gesture, with high potential
                        advantages, would cost nothing in terms of tangible resources. Also a
                        precedent exists for such a commemorative day: Pan American Day.<note n="2"

                    <pb facs="0081" n="29" xml:id="pg_29"/>
                    <p>If this recommendation is adopted and AFRICA DAY is proclaimed, it would be
                        most fitting to celebrate the first one at a Presidential reception for
                        African ambassadors and U.S. Negro leaders on May 25th. That reception could
                        be combined with the reception which African ambassadors propose to give to
                        celebrate the sixth <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> anniversary. (The
                        State Department has informed the White House of this proposal and
                        recommended that the President attend.)</p>
                    <p>The AFRICA DAY idea is being discussed with the African Bureau of State,
                        which has registered initial enthusiasm for it.<note n="3" xml:id="d14fn3"

                        proposes that:</p>
                    <p>—The U.S. Government give a quiet indication to the Soviets of support for
                        the project;</p>
                    <p>—We select an individual to be responsible for negotiations both in
                        Washington and abroad (including a check with appropriate members of
                        Congress to see that earlier indications of support still stand);</p>
                    <pb facs="0083" n="31" xml:id="pg_31"/>
                    <p>—We support, at a later time, an appropriation of up to $2 million for the
                        National Science Foundation (as the U.S. contribution to the project).</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Issues</p>
                    <p>We now need to make several decisions.</p>

                    <p>This memorandum presents conclusions we have drawn from the study. It also
                        sets forth our recommendations—first, in terms of the Agency’s psychological

                        action as a consequence of the study.</p>

                        Policy</p>
                    <p>1. Our evidence indicates that current foreign interest in Viet-Nam is not
                        very high and does not seem likely to become so as long as the Paris
                            talks<note n="3" xml:id="d17fn3">See <ref target="#d1fn2">footnote 2,

                        there is no major escalation of the war. At least at present, the U.S. is
                        not under heavy pressure to alter its course.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">We recommend that, from the viewpoint of the international
                            audience, the U.S. maintain its present relatively low level of public
                            treatment of Viet-Nam.</hi></p>
                    <p>2. Our study indicates that U.S. actions which can be seen as escalating the
                        conflict in Viet-Nam are very likely to have considerable psychological
                        repercussions in many areas of the world.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">If there should be a decision to resume bombing of North
                            Viet-Nam, or to take some other action interpretable as escalation, we
                            recommend careful advance psychological preparation of foreign opinion,
                            to seek acceptance of the U.S. action as justifiable and
                        necessary.</hi></p>
                    <p>3. An important exception to the general picture of current foreign interest
                        in Viet-Nam is that part of Asia which sees its own security tied to U.S.
                        firmness. Our study discloses fears of a softening U.S. commitment to Asia,
                        with the U.S. stand on Viet-Nam as a barometer of American intentions.
                        Reduction of U.S. strength in South Viet-Nam would almost surely intensify
                        Asian doubts about U.S. reliability. Pic<pb facs="0086" n="34"

                    <p>4. The present general state of world opinion—with the exceptions noted
                        above—does not now pose serious problems for the United States. But there is
                        a need to look ahead and begin preparing for the future—for the time when
                        the terms of a peace settlement may be a matter of keen public dispute.</p>
                    <p>From our analysis, it appears that—while media attention to Viet-Nam is
                        generally at a low level—there is no evidence that basic attitudes toward
                        the war have changed. Most of the public abroad simply wants it to end, and
                        would be inclined to applaud any settlement bringing the war to an end.
                        Furthermore, there is insufficient appreciation abroad of the role of the

                    <p>The following recommendations apply to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        Operations:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">1. Except in Asia, and in a few places like Sweden where
                            Viet-Nam is a continuing public opinion problem for the United States,
                            the current level of Agency treatment of Viet-Nam is adequate.</hi></p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">2. The Agency should make special efforts, in Asian
                            countries where reassurance is needed, to heighten confidence in the
                            reliability of U.S. commitments. Embodied clearly in these efforts,
                            however, should be continuing emphasis on efforts of the Asian nations
                            themselves to provide for their own defense.</hi></p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">3. The Agency should take additional steps to promote
                            foreign awareness of the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> as a
                            viable, broadly based, constitutional government. To promote awareness
                            of the successes of the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> in
                            shouldering its military and civil burdens is equally important. In the
                            latter effort, the most convincing voice would be the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>’s. Accordingly, the Agency should also
                            press the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> to improve and expand its
                            own overseas information activities. As the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1"
                                >GVN</gloss> does so, the level of the United States’ public
                            treatment of its role in Viet-Nam could be reduced.</hi></p>

                            Loomis</persName>, a meeting was arranged for Thursday afternoon May 1
                        to discuss State/<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> relationships in
                        terms of what was described as an “enlightened” interchange of personnel.
                        After noting the existence of such a program in the <gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                            >CU</gloss> and P areas, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        participants expressed the belief that there were other areas which could be
                        exploited to mutual advantage—both at State and in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>. The program in <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> (up to
                        40 persons from <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to man positions in
                            <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>) was one which gave some worry since
                        through the years it had been reduced to much smaller proportions than was
                        thought desirable. Rather than retrenching, it seemed that State and <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> ought to be expanding their
                        relationships. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> pointed out that the
                            <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> program was a natural focal point on
                        the domestic scene for returning cultural affairs officers.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that there were indeed areas other than in <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> and in P which could be examined to see
                        whether an expanded <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> representation in
                        State could be accommodated. Likewise, in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>, there were doubtless areas which could very profitably
                        absorb details of <gloss target="#t_FSO_1">FSO</gloss>’s from State.
                        Overseas the prospect seemed equally bright for both agencies, with the
                        suggestion underscored that where possible this interchange take place at
                        the same post. In the spirit of a positive approach by both sides it was
                        agreed that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and State would designate
                        officers to explore the ramifications of an expanded interchange program.
                        Both agencies would examine their position resources for the purpose of
                        identifying those most appropriate for an interchange. It was also agreed
                        that should an expanded program result, it would begin on a reasonable
                        scale—no mass movement of personnel.</p>

                    <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Special Factors</hi>—The Chinese have been exposed to
                        massive propaganda; they will be skeptical of anything with a propagandistic
                        flavor. The target audience is not thinking of destroying the system, but
                        turns to outside broadcasts for independent information and for release from

                        tries to act as a “window on the world.” The underlying purposes are:</p>
                    <p>1. to inform listeners of the real direction of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> policy.</p>
                    <p>2. to increase dissatisfaction with and distrust of Peking’s policies.</p>
                    <p>3. to stimulate a desire for a more realistic and reasonable stance by the

                    <p>D. <hi rend="italic">Themes</hi>—The <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> does
                        not threaten China; we seek a reduction of tensions. We retain our
                        friendship and respect for the Chinese people and look forward to an

                        will repel Communist aggression, but our purpose is defensive, and we seek
                        cooperation rather than hostility. We believe in the free flow of ideas and
                        people. Chinese Communist policies have interfered with China’s development
                        and have isolated China internationally. The great world problems transcend
                        national boundaries, and must be <pb facs="0090" n="38" xml:id="pg_38"/>
                        solved cooperatively. We wish to cooperate with all nations in programs of
                        mutual assistance. There are built-in fallacies in Communist ideology;

                    <p>The first Inter-Agency Youth Committee meeting since the change of

                    <p>The Counselor, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRF_1">Pedersen</persName>, who has

                        and the chairmanship of the inter-agency group, asked for a preliminary
                        discussion of objectives and operations in the youth effort. He urged that
                        these questions subsequently be reviewed in the bureaus and agencies. He

                        specific actions to increase emphasis on youth as a political factor.</p>
                    <p>A number of points threaded through the discussion, getting emphasis from
                        several speakers:</p>
                    <p>—The political necessity of our understanding the attitudes and values of
                        youth abroad;</p>
                    <p>—The need for more analytical reporting on the concerns felt by youth;</p>
                    <p>—The need to assign young officers to posts in countries where youth play a
                        critical political role, so as to establish contacts, develop relationships
                        and rapport, and produce the necessary reporting;</p>
                    <p>—The key role of the Ambassador in spurring an Embassy to the necessary
                        contact and reporting work, and the need for a periodic reminder to
                        Ambassadors of the importance Washington accords this work;</p>
                    <p>—“Influence” as a misleading and futile objective unless it is viewed as a
                        long-run by-product of individual relationships. <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> policy—as others see it—was cited as surely the prime
                        influencer.</p>
                    <p>—The desirability of “reverse influence”—the need to take into account in the
                        formulation of policy the concerns of youth as these become known through
                        political analysis and reporting.</p>
                    <p>Committee members generally reported that their bureaus and agencies are well
                        aware of the political importance of youth. However, <pb facs="0092" n="40"
                            xml:id="pg_40"/> most characterized performance in the field as spotty,
                        and dependent largely on the extent to which the Ambassador takes an
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRD_2">Cross</persName> opened the discussion by
                        tracing the evolution of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> objectives
                        vis-à-vis youth, beginning with the original impetus of the cold war
                        competition for the respect of the young elites of the Third World. What has
                        remained constant throughout, he said, has been the attempt to keep an
                        awareness in the foreign affairs agencies of youth as a political force in
                        their societies. Student uprisings last year in Paris,<note n="4"

                        this effort, and led to a call by two bureaus for a re-evaluation of the
                            <gloss target="#t_IAYC_1">IAYC</gloss> and its program. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CRD_2">Cross</persName> suggested that this, together with
                        the advent of the new Administration, offered an opportunity to rethink the
                        philosophy and the mechanism of the youth effort in order to make them
                        adequate to the needs of modern diplomacy in the Seventies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRF_1">Pedersen</persName> raised questions about
                        the nature of the phenomenon and its variations according to area; about
                        U.S. objectives—whether influence or understanding, and to what end, or
                        relationship with future leaders; about the degree of emphasis to be given
                        contact work, and whether more reporting is needed in order to develop a
                        better concept of what is going on in the world; whether it is sufficient
                        for the Embassies to develop these insights or whether it is necessary for
                        Washington to have them as well. (See attachment).<note n="6"

                    <p>Among ideas he has under consideration are a letter to new Ambassadors to
                        call their attention to youth as a political factor; a task force to update
                        the U.S. interest in students and youth abroad and to make recommendations
                        to the new Administration; a training seminar for <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                            >USG</gloss> personnel; and the possibility of earmarking certain funds
                        for U.S. purposes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_2">Sober</persName> said he considered the
                        various objectives suggested as all necessary and consistent with each
                        other. We need information that will tip us off to important changes in a
                        country. As to influence, it hangs largely on how youth abroad read U.S.
                        policies; despite our efforts to have our aims understood, there is a
                        fundamental difference of view about the validity of American activities.
                        This means there is a basic problem we cannot do much about. Nevertheless,
                        it is important to give periodic re-emphasis to the importance of contact
                        with youth, to analysis and reporting of their concerns, and to jacking up
                        the Ambassadors who tend to overlook its importance.</p>
                    <pb facs="0093" n="41" xml:id="pg_41"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WRL_1">Walkinshaw</persName> suggested that it is
                        necessary for us, relying largely on young officers in our Missions, to try
                        to understand the young people who are against the establishment, to observe
                        what is going on, express concern and establish rapport with them. Out of
                        this may come a continuing dialogue. He said the State Department needs more
                        analytical reporting on the changing attitudes and values of youth
                        abroad.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LPN_1">Lyman</persName> underscored the importance
                        of understanding youth as distinct from any attempt to influence them. We
                        must come to know what youth is concerned about; then, what may result is an
                        influence on our own policy. The kind of analysis and reporting that comes
                        from the field—on attitudes and emotions, frustrations and pressures, all in
                        the context of the particular economic changes underway in a given
                        country—is of extreme importance. To get such reporting, it is necessary to
                        have contacts with the youth in question. From there, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LPN_1">Lyman</persName> suggested, we can make decisions on
                        policy—changing ours or trying to change theirs.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman commended the existing instructions in the political affairs
                        volume of the Foreign Affairs Manual, covering what is expected of the field
                        in regard to youth and young leaders. However, he pointed out that they
                        place less emphasis on gaining an insight into current attitudes than on
                        working with future leaders with a view to the long run. Good instructions
                        notwithstanding, it was suggested, there remains the bureaucratic problem of
                        how to get the Ambassador and the Mission to do what they are supposed to
                        do.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRM_1">Beaudry</persName> drew a distinction
                        between cultivating future leaders in areas such as political parties or
                        labor movements, where so-called youth may be as old as 45 and where comers
                        generally are known to our Embassies, and in the more amorphous student
                        groups. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> must consider whether youth
                        are likely to affect the attitudes and policies of their own governments. We
                        can have little influence on student unrest in Europe, but political
                        reporting on students is important nonetheless. For the necessary contact
                        work, he said, Embassies are virtually limited to their officers under
                        30.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Ryan</persName> said <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has no illusions as to what is possible
                        in the way of influencing people. That Agency’s major goal is to provide
                        information. Reporting that shows why youth are unhappy with policies of the
                        U.S. or of their own country is particularly helpful to <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. We need to consider such attitudes when
                        we make foreign policy, but to get this reporting, it is necessary to keep
                        pressure on the Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PRF_1">Pedersen</persName> asked committee members
                        how much attention their bureaus and agencies and the Embassies give to
                        youth and students as a political force.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss>: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QTHE_1"
                            >Quimby</persName> reported his bureau has a high degree of awareness of
                        the problem. He suggested that we assign young officers to <pb facs="0094"
                            n="42" xml:id="pg_42"/> those countries where youth are evidently a
                        major factor, instead of relying on youth committees.</p>
                    <p>ARA: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRV_1">Bernhart</persName> said that ARA
                        officers have reason to be well aware of student problems. Nevertheless,
                        Embassy performance has been spotty, and this is largely a reflection of the
                        interest or lack of interest of the Ambassador. The ARA Bureau has been
                        reorganized and a State-<gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> office of
                        social and civic development has been set up to include youth. Some new and
                        interesting programs are underway.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_EA_1">EA</gloss>: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WRL_1"
                            >Walkinshaw</persName> said his Bureau is definitely aware of the
                        importance of youth, but the Embassies have an uneven record. When he
                        reviewed <gloss target="#t_EA_1">EA</gloss> policy assessment papers for the
                        past two years, he found not one had mentioned youth.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_EUR_1">EUR</gloss>: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRM_1"
                            >Beaudry</persName> said it is necessary to remember that radical youth
                        are a minority; he thinks the more accessible elements should be provided
                        with <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s factual information to counter
                        distortions resulting partly from hostile propaganda. The generation gap
                        that divides those who went through World War II and those who didn’t is
                        becoming apparent now in terms of concern about <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> and security. He feels we should support our friends among
                        the local leaders who are under attack by youth.</p>

                            >Sober</persName> said the limited access that prevails in a number of
                        countries puts the utility of a youth committee in question there. In
                        others, it may be a good time to encourage a renewed effort, now that the
                        bureau is changing a number of Ambassadors.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDN_1"
                            >Batson</persName> suggested that the best possible youth program would
                        be an increased <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> student exchange,
                        particularly where it is operated as a bi-national program. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CRD_2">Cross</persName> pointed out that while <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> exchanges are an important resource, some of
                        the youth who really count—in Ecuador, for example—would not come to the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> on a <gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                            >CU</gloss> grant.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_PC_1">PC</gloss>: Mr. Curtis said the Peace Corps sees
                        communication and influence as a two-way process rather than a means to
                        direct behavior. What is important is the mechanism that permits
                        communication to go on.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman asked whether the unequaled insights into attitudes acquired by
                        Volunteers abroad were funneled back to <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                        policy makers so that they might have an impact on this government. Mr.
                        Curtis explained that the departing Volunteer is debriefed abroad by two
                            <gloss target="#t_PC_1">PC</gloss> staffers whose report is sent to the
                        Peace Corps in Washington. The Chairman, upon learning that these reports
                        are not shared with the State Department, suggested this was an area that
                        might be examined. Mr. Curtis and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QTHE_1"
                            >Quimby</persName> warned that this might be mistaken for intelligence

                            >Pedersen</persName> said the question is one of getting better
                        guidelines for U.S. policies; he thought the Volunteers might well want to
                        have such an influence on government policy.</p>

                            >Ryan</persName> said <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has always
                        looked on youth as a major target. In Latin America, where there are
                        nineteen student affairs grantees, programs are extensive. Elsewhere, the
                        Voice of America has just developed a Saturday night “rock” music program
                        for Poland; exchanges in Eastern Europe and the American Cultural Center in
                        Paris focus on youth. A good deal of the agency’s research is directed at
                        youth. But the world-wide operation has been affected by the <gloss

                        often have been irritated by repeated appeals in the name of the youth

                        policy. Half of the several thousand participants brought here annually
                        under the program are under 30 or 35. In attempting to influence their
                        attitudes toward change and modernization, we indirectly affect their
                        attitude toward the U.S.</p>

                        generally good awareness of the political importance of youth, if “youth”
                        can be said to encompass something more than those under 30. Awareness is
                        good also throughout the military system. The Defense Department has come a
                        long way since 1964: The $42 million-a-year program to train foreign
                        military is now augmented by a $3-to-4 million “information program” that
                        grew out of an effort by the <gloss target="#t_IAYC_1">IAYC</gloss> five
                        years ago. The information program carries a wide range of objectives and
                        brings foreign trainees into touch with American labor leaders, press, the
                        racial situation, etc. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DHA_1">Dunlap</persName>
                        said he intends to shift more money to these efforts in coming months and
                        years. He finds the key to success lies with the Ambassador: If he is
                        enthusiastic, then the whole process is focused on bringing potential future
                        leaders rather than just on training in firing a gun or giving a trip to a

                        So does firmness in support of South Vietnamese self-determination.</p>
                    <p>The President’s statement is the most comprehensive definition so far of
                        American peace aims. It is also the most flexible program of ways to achieve
                        Vietnamese peace that has yet been proposed.</p>
                    <p>Only one of the principles underlying that program is immutable: That the
                        U.S. will not compromise on the right of self-determination for the South
                        Vietnamese people, and will stay the course until that right is
                        realized.</p>
                    <p>In the wake of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName>’s major
                        policy statement, U.S. officials emphasize these new initiatives:</p>
                    <p>—Provision for a peace achieved either by a formal negotiated settlement or
                        by an informal understanding. This is a new flexibility.</p>
                    <p>—Provision for a simultaneous start of mutual foreign troop withdrawals from
                        South Viet-Nam, for agreement on a mutually acceptable timetable, and for
                        rapid accomplishment. This would extend to withdrawal of North Vietnamese
                        forces from Cambodia and Laos too. It would effectively end hostilities.</p>
                    <p>—Provision for North Viet-Nam to remove its forces from the south without
                        having to admit that they are there now.</p>
                    <p>—Provision for U.S. participation in multilateral talks on political matters,
                        if South Viet-Nam invites this.</p>
                    <p>—Provision for a mutually acceptable supervisory body to verify withdrawals
                        and cease-fire arrangements.</p>
                    <pb facs="0097" n="45" xml:id="pg_45"/>
                    <p>U.S. officials point out that these proposals, like the entire statement
                        itself, were made after continuing and full consultation with South
                        Vietnamese President Thieu.</p>
                    <p>The American officials also underscore:</p>
                    <p>—The extreme flexibility of the President’s realistic and reasonable
                        proposals of a framework for serious negotiations.</p>
                    <p>—The willingness of the Nixon administration to hear and discuss
                        counterproposals from any of the parties at the Paris talks.</p>
                    <p>The tone of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName>’s policy
                        statement, and the flexibility of his peace proposals, are evidence of
                        sincere U.S. determination to bring about a mutually acceptable settlement
                        of the Viet-Nam war. It is emphatically not to be interpreted as a sign of
                        weakness—any lessening of U.S. firmness in support of South Vietnamese
                        self-determination.</p>
                    <p>It would be tragic for the North Vietnamese government to believe that time
                        is on its side—that prolongation of hostilities, or disagreement over
                        Viet-Nam within the United States, will force the U.S. to retreat. That
                        error of judgment could only bring more suffering and bloodshed to the
                        people of Viet-Nam in place of the peace that they desire. In President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName>’s words: “If the needless
                        suffering continues, this would affect other decisions. Nobody has anything
                        to gain by delay.”<note n="3" xml:id="d21fn3">The complete sentence reads:
                            “I must also make clear, in all candor, that if the needless suffering
                            continues, this will affect other decisions. Nobody has anything to gain
                            by delay.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_NP_1"

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName>’s studied proposals allow
                        all sides considerable room for accommodation. What the U.S. and its allies
                        seek is not a paper peace but a peace that is a fact. That real peace is
                        within range of the many possibilities encompassed in President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName>’s comprehensive and flexible
                        proposals. It is now up to the other side to decide what kind of

                    <p>On May 19, 1969, the United States Advisory Commission on Information
                        released its 24th report, covering the calendar year of 1968, and later
                        submitted the report to both the House of Representatives and the Senate
                        under a transmittal letter dated July 1, 1969. The members of the Commission
                        at the time of the report’s release were Chairman <persName
                            corresp="#p_SFN_1">Frank Stanton</persName>, <persName
                            corresp="#p_LSS_1">Sigurd S. Larmon</persName>, <persName

                            Vail</persName>. In the foreword of the report, the members stressed
                        that the Commission, established in 1948 to “watch over a communications
                        dialogue with the rest of the world,” had “arrived simultaneously at its
                        majority and an inescapable conclusion: Our national commitment is
                        incomplete.” Noting the disparity in funding between U.S. information
                        activities and defense and international affairs programs, the Commission
                        asserted:</p>
                    <p>“Our concern is a matter of record. ‘There are four channels through which a
                        nation may conduct its foreign affairs. The first is diplomacy. The second
                        is trade. The third is communication. The fourth is force. Three are
                        complementary, the last is alternative. Indeed, the last alternative. It is
                        indicative of the disordered priorities of our time that 95 percent of our
                        foreign affairs moneys are devoted to the channel that the other 5 percent
                        is dedicated to avoid.’</p>
                    <p>“But the essential problem is not in dollars. It is in direction.</p>
                    <p>“Which way best leads from where we are to where we want the world to be?</p>
                    <p>“How are the two hundred million of us to convince the thirty-three hundred
                        million of them that we are on the right path, and that it is wide enough
                        for all to travel.</p>
                    <p>“Eventually, if not now, it must be through knowing each other, then trusting
                        each other.</p>
                    <p>“And if eventually, why not now?</p>
                    <p>“That is the petition of the 24th Report.”</p>

                    <p>In the first paragraph of the body of the report, the Commission assessed the
                        United States’ global standing. It concluded: “The world’s curiosity about
                        the United States—about its policies and intentions, its actions and
                        capabilities—has increased in proportion to the growth of America’s power
                        and influence. The world’s <hi rend="italic">opinion</hi> about the United
                        States has fluctuated measurably. In recent years, the trend has been <pb
                            facs="0099" n="47" xml:id="pg_47"/> down.” (Ibid., page 5) The
                        Commission noted that a number of opportunities “remain unexploited” and
                        that “some past gains must be consolidated,” linking these statements to
                        nine areas for improvement regarding the United States Information Agency
                            (<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>): research, Voice of America

                        techniques, the connection of private resources to the U.S. communications
                        program, foreign journalists and news organizations, representation
                        allowances, and the career corps for Foreign Service Information Officers
                        (FSIOs). (Ibid., pages 5–6) The Commission ended the report, stating:</p>
                    <p>“One basic theme is common to this and the 23 earlier reports prepared by
                        this Commission for the Congress and the President: that America’s foreign
                        policy must be strengthened by the infusion of psychological or
                        communications factors. This can occur only if <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> is permitted to play a role where the action is—in the
                        National Security Council, with the Secretary of State, with Ambassadors
                        abroad, and wherever feasible in the Cabinet. The past 20 years have seen
                        tortured, though discernible, progress toward that end. It is our hope that
                        the reluctance of the past will be overcome by the enthusiastic endorsement
                        of the future.” (Ibid., page 9)</p>
                    <p>The Commission members included an afterword in the 24th Report, referencing
                        a recommendation made in the previous year’s report regarding a “major
                        review,” predicated on 11 questions, of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> and “the governmental context in which it operates.” Such
                        questions, the Committee conceded, “are still worth asking:</p>

                            activities. Please destroy this as I am sure Henry would be upset if he

                            Czechoslovakia,<note n="3" xml:id="d26fn3">See <ref target="#d1fn3"

                        jamming which has continued up to the present.</p>
                    <p>It is difficult to prove categorically that Soviet electronic interference
                        “recently intensified,” in part because of the practical impossibility of
                        accurately measuring reception of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        programs in all parts of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and in
                        part because of the use of differing types of jamming.</p>
                    <p>At least for the area of Moscow, where—because of the presence of the
                        American Embassy—we are able to get regular reports on <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> reception, the Soviet jamming effort
                        appears to have become less selective and more continuous in recent months.
                        A rough estimate would be that 80–85% of the 13 hours per day of <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> programs beamed to <pb facs="0107" n="55"
                            xml:id="pg_55"/> the Moscow area (central European Russia) are now
                        subject to a significant level of purposeful interference.</p>
                    <p>It is harder to give an estimate for outlying areas, where U.S. travel is
                        relatively less frequent, and travel by technical personnel capable of
                        making accurate measurements is quite rare. But certainly there is less
                        jamming in peripheral areas than in and around Moscow. For some reason, for
                        example, we know of no attempt to block <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        programs in the Baltic languages (Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian).
                        However, all other non-Russian broadcasts to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> have been targets for jamming along with our Russian
                        programming.</p>
                    <p>The jamming has taken various forms. Our programming in the 25 meter band and
                        above is generally blocked by superimposition of a strong local Soviet
                        station (Radio “Mayak,” which means “beacon”), broadcasting light popular
                        music, commentary, and news. Below the 25 meter band, <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts are generally subject to the
                        traditional, harshly unpleasant electronic buzz of the jammer.</p>
                    <p>We made an early diplomatic protest, but have taken no action since, in large
                        part because we have expected that the jamming would be stopped after the
                        reconsolidation of the Soviet position in Czechoslovakia. On September 19,

                        and reacted defensively; one muttered that “this sort of thing reflects
                        special circumstances.” The <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officer
                        got the impression that the time might be ripe for a new diplomatic démarche
                        on the subject.</p>
                    <p>We have other options as well. We might raise the Soviet jamming formally
                        through <gloss target="#t_ITU_1">ITU</gloss> channels, but the practical
                        effect would probably be only to increase publicity. Much the same could be
                        said of the suggestion of bringing the matter to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                            >UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Our ultimate—and I think undesirable—option would be to retaliate in kind by
                        reactivating a powerful long wave <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        transmitter near Munich, Germany, which when used, effectively blocks out
                        Moscow Radio broadcasts to Eastern Europe. Our use of this transmitter
                        caused the Soviets to protest through the <gloss target="#t_ITU_1"
                            >ITU</gloss> several years ago and we ceased operations, but the
                        equipment is still in place.</p>
                    <p>My personal opinion is that the jamming has probably outlasted its usefulness
                        even in Soviet eyes, but once this sort of thing is set in motion, it is
                        difficult bureaucratically to stop it, unless the order comes from the very
                        top. The jamming is of course indefensible and contradicts the Soviet
                        assertion that they favor increased exchanges of information. I think that
                        if we make real progress on preparations for <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss>, we should point out the incompatibility of their
                        continued jamming with U.S.-Soviet cooperation on disarmament.<note n="6"

                        safe to say that no past event has been seen on television or followed by
                        radio by so large a proportion of humanity. Partly, as a result of this,
                        partly because of the magnitude of the event itself, no comparable number of
                        human beings has ever had as deep a sense of participation in a news story
                        or as deep a feeling of identification with two men as they did with

                    <p>Of the currently estimated total television audience of 650 million which
                        watched the moon walk as it happened, 500 million were abroad, 320 million
                        in Western and Eastern Europe, 75 million in Latin America, and most of the
                        rest in Japan and elsewhere in Asia. The Japanese audience at the time of
                        the moon walk was estimated at 70 to 80 million. In Italy, some 40 million
                        watched the telecast. According to our present information, of the countries
                        of Western or Eastern Europe, only the Soviet Union, East Germany, and
                        Iceland failed to relay the <gloss target="#t_Eurovision_1"
                            >Eurovision</gloss> coverage of this event. Tape coverage was, however,
                        included in regular Soviet <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> newscasts.
                        Elsewhere in the world, all countries which had the technical capability of
                        telecasting Apollo 11 live did so. Thanks to last-minute arrangements by
                            <gloss target="#t_NASA_1">NASA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_COMSAT_1"
                            >COMSAT</gloss>, this included all Latin American countries, with the
                        exception of Paraguay, Ecuador, and Cuba. (Venezuela and Colombia sought
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> help and went to great expense
                        themselves to lease a portable ground station for live <gloss

                        Tunisian, and Libyan television were part of the worldwide circuit. Finally,
                        television stations in Asia—Japan, Australia, the Philippines, Thailand, and
                        Korea—covered the event simultaneously and as fully as it was covered
                        anywhere. All other television stations around the world (outside Communist
                        China, Russia, and East Germany) may be assumed to be carrying taped or
                        filmed reports as fast as they can get them.</p>

                    <p>The Voice of America, relayed by both the domestic and external services of
                        the <gloss target="#t_BBC_1">BBC</gloss>, as well as by All-India Radio and
                        at least 22 other national networks around the world and by well over 1400
                        individual radio stations in Latin America, calculates its audience during
                        the moon landing and walk to have been over 500 million. Jamming of Russian
                        language broadcasts in the Soviet Union continued uninterrupted but English
                        transmissions to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and two channels
                        in Mandarin beamed to Red China were clear.</p>
                    <p>Well over 800 foreign correspondents and media men covered the mission from
                        Cape <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> and the Houston Manned
                        Space Center in a total of 33 languages. The Japanese, 120 strong,
                        represented the largest single national contingent. There were 200 media
                        representatives from Latin America, and some 300 from Europe.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps more important than all these figures has been the depth and
                        seriousness of coverage in many countries. Most radio and <gloss
                            target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> stations abroad prepared their audiences for
                        the Apollo 11 mission for weeks, by broadcasting documentaries on past space
                        exploits, interviews with experts, and detailed explanations of the mission
                        plan. Newspapers in many countries have devoted a page a day to the
                        preparations for the moon landing mission, and there have been impressive
                        special space issues of mass publication periodicals in Italy and elsewhere.
                        They have generally drawn the bulk of their source material from our own
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> output.</p>
                    <p>As for comment on the mission, the reactions flowing in indicate that the
                        impact was great. Apart from the Communist Chinese press in Hong Kong (and
                        presumably in Mainland China itself)—which speaks of this exploit as the
                        last gasp of American imperialism—reporting has been positive and
                        enthusiastic, with of course an occasional negative comment. The Arab world,
                        the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> included, joined in the general
                        mood of euphoria. Communist papers in the West, like <hi rend="italic"
                            >L’Humanite</hi> in France and <hi rend="italic">Unita</hi> in Italy,
                        echoed the chorus of approval resounding around them, only gently expressing
                        their preference for the Soviet approach of unmanned space probes. Some
                        papers in both the industrialised and underdeveloped world (e.g., the <hi
                            rend="italic">Times</hi> of London and <hi rend="italic">Addis
                            Reporter</hi> in Ethiopia) mentioned the contrast between the billions
                        spent for space exploration and lack of success in dealing with urgent
                        problems facing humanity here on Earth—but many (e.g., <hi rend="italic"
                            >Rheinische</hi> Post in Germany and <hi rend="italic">Ittefan</hi> in
                        Pakistan) answered such criticism by noting that this great undertaking of
                        man does not hinder human progress, but in the long run helps humanity
                        marshal its talents and resources in solving age-old problems. Most papers
                        were simply lost in awe on this “day in our history, the like of which none
                        of us has ever seen or will live to see again” (<hi rend="italic">Daily
                            Mail</hi>). They saw “the feat of all time . . . accomplished” (<hi
                            rend="italic">Figaro</hi>). They commented that “the <pb facs="0114"
                            n="62" xml:id="pg_62"/> consequences of this first step are beyond
                        imagining” (<hi rend="italic">Die Welt</hi>). They noted that “Man knew he
                        would conquer (space) not for the sake of conquest, not for self, but for
                        freedom of spirit and humanity.” (<hi rend="italic">Working People’s
                            Daily</hi>, Burma)</p>
                    <p>Evidence of the profound impact of the moon landing from all corners of the
                        world is copious and often moving. It ranges from the Pope’s hailing the
                        astronauts as “conquerors of the moon” and Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_WH_1">Wilson</persName>’s stating his profound admiration
                        for them, to the Pakistani newspaperman’s expressing gratitude that he
                        belongs to the generation which has witnessed an event of this magnitude.

                        spite of the modest coverage of the flight by Soviet media, Americans living
                        there were congratulated by Russian friends and even by chance
                        acquaintances. The Moscow Embassy received congratulatory telegrams, as well
                        as a number of telephone calls inquiring about the progress of the mission.
                        The President of Chile<note n="5" xml:id="d29fn5">Frei.</note> called on
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KEM_1">Korry</persName> to say how pleased
                        he was. He, as well as a number of other chiefs of state, declared July 21 a
                        national holiday. School children in Bavaria and students in Mexico were
                        excused from classes that day. Many world capitals were deserted at the time
                        of the launch or during other daytime events, as people stayed near their
                        television sets. Church bells rang out and fire sirens screamed to announce
                        the moon landing in various Latin American cities. Laplanders followed the
                        flight on their transistor radios while pasturing their reindeer.</p>

                    <p>Following guidance received from Presidential party and given to <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> media:</p>
                    <p>1. The Nixon administration intends this to be an era of negotiations in
                        which American Foreign Policy will not be based on the assumption of
                        intrinsic hostility, unless such hostility is demonstrated by specific
                        action.</p>
                    <p>2. Peace in Asia—which is a precondition to peace in the world—cannot result
                        primarily from American conceptions but has to involve Asian initiatives and
                        regional and sub-regional arrangements that have an Asian origin.</p>
                    <p>3. The United States would be prepared to support such regional
                        Arrangements—especially in the economic field—if American assistance were
                        requested and, in the U.S. view required.</p>

                            >Jack Crockett</persName> has given us an excellent, almost verbatim
                        report of the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> Conference which will be
                        very helpful to us in future planning. Since it is over sixty pages long, we
                        are sending you a summary of the main points discussed.</p>
                    <p>If this summary stimulates further discussion at your post of some of the
                        main issues we faced at Manila, it will have served its main purpose. We
                        have not attempted here to underline points of particular favor here in the
                        Agency. Rather, we have tried to reflect as accurately as possible the gist
                        of our remarks and the trends in the participants’ thinking.</p>
                    <p>Some of these opinions—and our own policy decisions—will be incorporated in
                        the 1969 Area Plan and possibly in other communications from <gloss

                        <p>PAOs and Acting PAOs from 14 <gloss target="#t_IAF_1">IAF</gloss> posts
                            met in Manila for three days of discussion. Deputy Director <persName
                                corresp="#p_LH_1">Loomis</persName> and representatives of <gloss

                            Okinawa were accompanied by military representatives from <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCPAC_1">CINCPAC</gloss> and 7th <gloss
                                target="#t_PsyOps_1">Psy Ops</gloss> Group, Okinawa. (Since Deputy
                            Director <persName corresp="#p_LH_1">Henry Loomis</persName>’s remarks
                            were taped and sent to each <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>, they
                            are not included in this summary.)</p>
                        <p>I. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_PPBS_1">PPBS</gloss>:</hi> We
                            agreed that despite some usefulness, the total exercise as presently
                            constituted has not been worth the effort. But some regular analysis of
                            our programs is needed, possibly not annually. Exposures as a main
                            pillar of <gloss target="#t_PPBS_1">PPBS</gloss> should be dropped.</p>
                        <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Attitudes Towards America:</hi> Asians are, to
                            varying degrees, America watchers. America’s domestic problems are,
                            however, first viewed in terms of their possible influence on <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policies and actions towards Asia. Many
                            PAOs saw little evidence of intellectual interest in <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> racial, urban and student disorders and
                            their causes. But there was general agreement that <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> prestige is diminished when we are not
                            able to solve our own problems at home.</p>
                        <p>PAOs emphasized that the image of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            usually depended more on the state of bi-lateral relations (security
                            treaty, Okinawa, Korean military modernization, trade restrictions) than
                            on developments within the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>PAOs agreed that evidence of progress in solving our domestic problems
                            was needed. It was suggested that the Agency summarize more frequently
                            progress in integration, the elimination of poverty, etc.</p>
                        <p>III. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Policy in
                                Asia:</hi> It was also suggested that posts should plan Americana
                            programming after first analyzing local interests and objec<pb
                                facs="0118" n="66" xml:id="pg_66"/>tives of the host country, then
                            selecting information about the American experience which can be made
                            relevant to those local interests.</p>
                        <p>To meet field needs dealing with the United States, the Agency must take
                            into account divergent levels of understanding, even within one
                            geographic area. This has been a problem with world-wide films. PAOs
                            were full of praise for films on the Apollo project, but wished for
                            faster delivery. More acquired films should be offered the posts (copies
                            of <gloss target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss> acquisitions were
                            distributed.)</p>
                        <p>It was also suggested that the Agency prepare a regular feature on “what
                            Americans are thinking,” based on numerous domestic polls, and that the
                            Agency cover more fully favorable comment about the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> from well-known foreign specialists.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ODP_1">Oleksiw</persName> described Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GM_1">Green</persName>’s emphasis on
                            “modesty, mutuality and multi-lateralism” and suggested that these
                            themes should be applied to <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> work
                            as well as to <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> foreign policy in Asia.
                            He also suggested that, as <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policies
                            are reassessed and newly articulated, <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                                >USIS</gloss> posts must find ways of demonstrating continued <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interest in Asia. Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_GM_1">Green</persName>’s emphasis on Asian
                            initiatives and cooperation was noted, and it was suggested that there
                            needs to be more stress on Asian commitment to Asian progress. Many PAOs
                            reported uncertainty as to the direction of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> foreign policy and especially the strength of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> commitments in Asia.</p>
                        <p>There was general agreement that while regional cooperation is desirable,
                            its development would be difficult in the absence of a <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> defensive umbrella. Furthermore, the
                            chances for an Asian regional security system appeared to the conferees
                            to be slim.</p>
                        <p>IV. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and National
                                Development:</hi> While there was general agreement that <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts in developing countries should
                            be involved in national development (where national development was a
                            goal of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>), there may be a lack
                            of precision in understanding the overall <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> objective and in defining the best areas for <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> concentration. To a large extent,
                            the role of <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> in national
                            development must be shaped by the differing situation in each country.
                            Thus there must be flexibility in the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                                >USIA</gloss> approach to nation-building. An overall, governing
                            policy from Washington would probably be impractical.</p>
                        <p>Posts should avoid national development programs which get ahead of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> national interests; posts should
                            not imply that we have all the answers to another country’s
                            developmental problems. But we should be thoroughly involved in <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> programs, especially dealing with
                            communications, and develop appropriate <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                                >USIS</gloss> efforts which are coordinated with <gloss

                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> national goals in the host country.</p>
                        <p>Discussion of <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> development activity

                            these particularly important points:</p>
                        <pb facs="0119" n="67" xml:id="pg_67"/>
                        <p>1. Through the communications media, the educational system, and
                            community organizations, <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> can
                            stimulate discussion and foster actions supporting national
                            development.</p>
                        <p>2. In most cases, <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> is a catalyst,
                            bringing people and ideas together, sharing both <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> and other relevant experience and scholarship. Our
                            purpose is to foster a climate conducive to the growth of free
                            institutions, social/economic progress and national unity.</p>
                        <p>3. In some instances, especially in insurgency-threatened situations and
                            especially where host governments are ill-prepared, <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> can contribute effectively to
                            training in information skills of host country officials.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> can also sometimes provide
                            useful information advice, where host governments welcome this
                            assistance, and information equipment as well, working with <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>. But an objective should be to
                            strengthen host government ability to operate its own information
                            programs, not to reinforce dependence on <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                                >USIS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. In support of national development goals, <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                                >USIS</gloss> posts need to identify the “agents of change,” those
                            in and out of government, often not among the top leadership, who are
                            advocating and carrying out significant changes likely to promote
                            national development. These “agents” may be at the bureau level within
                            ministries, among student leaders, within the political opposition,
                            among religious leaders or young, upcoming journalists. They are often
                            not among the elite, who often tend to be more satisfied with the status
                            quo.</p>
                        <p>6. Key obstacles to national development are: a) unfamiliarity of urban
                            leaders with conditions and attitudes in rural areas; b) insufficient
                            local media understanding of national development; c) traditionalism; d)
                            inadequate exchange of information and experience with other developing
                            countries.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Seminars</hi></p>
                        <p>Seminars, both single-country and regional, can be useful if: they are
                            well-planned; there is sufficient local interest and indigenous
                            sponsorship; there is careful selection of participants; and there is
                            imaginative follow-up. Seminars provide an excellent means of targetting
                            ideas to the right people; they can provide a focus for multi-media
                            support from Washington and locally; they facilitate exchange of views
                            among Asian leaders and hence encourage regional ties and cooperation.
                            One caveat: <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> visibility should be
                            low.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Books and Libraries</hi></p>
                        <p>It is important for <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts to help
                            strengthen indigenous libraries and to provide them with essential books
                            about the United States and supporting <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> foreign policies. We should not be satisfied with <pb
                                facs="0120" n="68" xml:id="pg_68"/> the reading room syndrome, but
                            should get the right books to the right people, through their own
                            institutions where possible. Our own libraries can be very useful in
                            some countries. In others, we should work to turn the books over to
                            local libraries, as we have done in Australia, concentrating our own
                            effort on stronger reference collections. As <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                                >USIS</gloss> posts improve their reference service and focus more
                            sharply on targetting books to selected audiences, they will need better
                            trained library personnel.</p>

                        <p>Bangkok has developed very extensive commercial distribution of Agency
                            books in Thai through promotion of sales of <hi rend="italic"
                                >Seripharb</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Horizons</hi>). A new title a
                            month is published, and 6–9,000 copies are sold commercially. Each title
                            is offered to <hi rend="italic">Seripharb’s</hi> 43,000 subscribers at a
                            special rate (about $.20). Each issue of <hi rend="italic"
                                >Seripharb</hi> sent to subscribers included a promotional flyer.
                            The books are also sold over the counter. Post funds were involved
                            originally in establishing a revolving fund for the distributor who now
                            makes a steady, small profit. There are no distribution costs to <gloss

                        <p>China will probably step up its diplomatic activity around the world and
                            continue its support of insurgent groups in Thailand, Burma, India and
                            elsewhere. At home, China is still in the throes of the cultural

                        <p>Hong Kong would like posts’ usage reports of China material, especially

                        <p>By the end of the summer, there will be another <gloss target="#t_FSIO_1"
                                >FSIO</gloss> list which will include lateral entries. Some
                            officers, upon entry as FSIOs, may have to pay into the Foreign Service
                            Retirement Fund for any time they were uncovered, or where their
                            contribution under different systems was not equivalent to the <gloss
                                target="#t_FS_1">FS</gloss> one. There is no requirement to pay for
                            service credited while in the military. Whether it will be to an
                            officer’s advantage to pay for uncovered years will depend on each
                            individual case.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the new Evaluation Reports, it was emphasized that no rating
                            form could replace an officer’s frequent discussions with his
                            subordinates on the work they were doing.</p>
                        <p>The Phase II Program was explained. The program is designed to bring
                            junior officers back to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> at an
                            earlier, critical stage in their career for three years, to update
                            personnel in their own culture, prepare them for later assignments in
                            the Agency and provide additional area <pb facs="0124" n="72"
                                xml:id="pg_72"/> and language training. A course in communications
                            is being developed and will be included in Phase II.</p>
                        <p>Some PAOs expressed concern that the Agency had become so dependent on
                            JOTs for its new talent and that, because of <gloss target="#t_BALPA_1"
                                >BALPA</gloss>,<note n="8" xml:id="d31fn8">See <ref target="#d20fn7"

                            outside the Agency had been suspended. It was explained that this
                            suspension was only temporary. Some PAOs also did not think that the
                            resignation rate of 200 out of a total of 600 JOTs (since the program’s
                            inception) spoke very well for the <gloss target="#t_JOT_1">JOT</gloss>
                            program.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Foreign National Employee Training</hi></p>
                        <p>The function of the new Regional Local Employee Training Officer was
                            explained. He is available to posts to: 1) help explain the role of
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> in each country; 2) update
                            employees’ knowledge of current developments on the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> scene; 3) organize (or arrange for
                            others to provide) training programs in the area for key local
                            personnel. The Regional Training Officer, Charles Vetter, would spend up
                            to three weeks in a country and would be prepared to visit branch posts
                            as well.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Research</hi></p>
                        <p>There was strong opinion favoring restoration of the recently <gloss
                                target="#t_BALPA_1">BALPA</gloss>’d Regional Research Officer. The
                            general outlook for research in the Agency appears promising, but it
                            would take time to recruit good people. Emphasis on research should
                            shift from “interesting” surveys to partly qualitative studies with
                            program implications. PAOs agreed that they needed more research on
                            programs and related products. The most effective research for <gloss
                                target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should not only tell us where we
                            have been but also indicate future directions for <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> programming decisions.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Horizons and Dialogue</hi></p>
                        <p>PAOs were generally satisfied with both publications as is. More
                            sophisticated articles on national and regional development might be
                            printed in separate pamphlets for limited, more targeted distribution.
                                <hi rend="italic">Horizons</hi> was praised highly by many PAOs.
                            However, the magazine has less appeal in the more sophisticated
                            countries, such as Japan. It was suggested that <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>2. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> and I, <persName
                            corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Frank Shakespeare</persName>, and our Ambassadors
                        believe these exchange activities contribute directly and importantly both
                        to the achievement of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policy objectives
                        and to the enhancement of our image and influence all around the world. The
                        programs have suffered badly in recent years from both neglect and meat axe
                        budget cuts. We, in the Department of State, are determined to see them <pb
                            facs="0126" n="74" xml:id="pg_74"/> reinvigorated and in some instances,
                        redirected. We are confident that <persName corresp="#p_RJ_1">John
                            Richardson</persName> will provide the necessary strong and imaginative
                        leadership.</p>
                    <p>Such early and tangible evidence of Presidential interest and support would
                        be of enormous help to him and to us in rebuilding morale and restoring
                        momentum in the responsible bureau. Further, if the Senate does restore the
                        funds (as appears unlikely without this intervention), we will have the
                        elbow-room so urgently needed to revive the programs and to restore
                        confidence in these important aspects of our relations with other countries
                        all around the world.</p>
                    <p>3. The timing for such an initiative in support of the “<persName
                            corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName> Exchange Program” seems
                        especially auspicious just now following the moon landing and the
                        President’s trip.<note n="5" xml:id="d32fn5">In addition to his state visit
                            to Romania (see <ref target="#d28fn4">footnote 4, Document 28</ref>),

                        emphatically but quietly signal to anxious academic, cultural and
                        intellectual constituencies here and abroad this Administration’s serious
                        interest in developing these constructive means of international
                        communication. The action will be especially welcomed now because it is
                        widely believed that lack of Presidential support in 1967 and 1968 was the
                        prime factor in the 42% nose dive in appropriations for these programs which
                        occurred in that period. The response should be equally favorable whether or
                        not the Senate restores the funds.</p>
                    <p>The last such Presidential intervention was through a similar letter from Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> to Senator <persName

                        House cut in the summer of 1964. The Senate did, in that case, respond.</p>

                            appropriate to hold the first rest day somewhere other than Lima. If
                            possible we would suggest rest days both at Quito and Rio de Janeiro. We
                            realise that makes three rest days in the first nine days of the trip,
                            but to avoid fatigue at the outset that might be useful. If only one
                            rest day is desired we would recommend Rio de Janeiro, since Quito has a
                            relatively high altitude, which could fatigue the Astronauts
                            otherwise.</p>
                        <p>3. Similarly, Canberra is not as interesting a place for a rest day as
                            Tokyo and we would suggest moving that rest day to Tokyo.<note n="6"

                        <p>4. There is some question as to whether the airport at Rawalpindi is
                            adequate to receive the Presidential jet aircraft and that it might
                            prove necessary to land at Lahore or Karachi. In that connection we
                            would suggest moving that rest day to either New Delhi or Tehran. There
                            will be an Asian fair at Tehran when the Astronauts arrive and that
                            might make an enjoyable rest day.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Staffing</p>
                        <p>We will be happy to provide a State Department staff assistant for the
                            trip. We would also suggest that a Protocol officer from State would be
                            useful. (We have a Protocol officer who has been on Astronaut trips
                            before). In addition the staff assistant for the Department’s Astronaut
                            Travel Committee is already familiar with the preliminary planning for
                            the trip. Furthermore, he is a former <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                                >USIA</gloss> staffer and has had public affairs experience at
                            State.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> would probably want to put a
                            Voice of America regional staffer on the plane, changing him as the trip
                            moves from one area to another. We would recommend a spare seat be kept
                            for this and suggest another spare seat be kept in case it was necessary
                            to pick up additional secretarial or other help from the posts for brief
                            periods as the trip progresses.</p>
                        <p>6. You may wish to consider adding State, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                                >USIA</gloss> or White House personnel to the advance trip. State
                            has no preference in this matter. I believe <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                                >USIA</gloss> would like to have one person on the advance
                            party.</p>

                    <p rend="center">SUMMARY</p>
                    <p>U.S. standing in science and the exploration of space advanced considerably
                        after the successful completion of the Apollo 11 mission, according to
                        surveys conducted immediately before and after the flight in Great Britain,
                        France, India, Japan, the Philippines and Venezuela.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d34fn2">Germany was included in the survey but is not included
                            in the report since post-Apollo 11 data had not been received at the
                            time of writing. In Britain and France, findings were based on national
                            adult samplings. In India, only literates in four major cities were
                            surveyed. The figures in Venezuela, Japan and the Philippines are based
                            on samplings of adults in the capital cities. Pre-Apollo interviewing
                            was conducted in early July; post-Apollo interviewing between July 25
                            and August 7. [Footnote is in the original.]</note> Opinion of U.S.
                        military strength rose slightly in three of these countries—Britain, France
                        and Japan—and increased moderately in Manila. The moon landing improved
                        considerably general opinion of the United States in France, but had a
                        barely significant effect in Britain, Japan, or the Philippines.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d34fn3">The question was not asked in India or Venezuela.
                            [Footnote is in the original.]</note></p>
                    <p>More people abroad knew which country had conducted the Apollo 11 mission,
                        and could give the name of the mission or spaceship than recalled such
                        information about the mid-May Apollo 10 flight.<note n="4" xml:id="d34fn4"
                            >See <ref target="#d25fn2">footnote 2, Document 25</ref>.</note>
                        Practically all those interviewed after the landing knew that the United
                        States had landed men on the moon. At least eight out of ten could name the
                        mission or its craft.</p>
                    <p>The Apollo 11 moon landing seemed to leave a strong immediate impact upon an
                        overseas audience already generally impressed by the earlier Apollo 10
                        flight. At least 80 per cent in all surveyed countries were impressed to
                        some degree with the moon landing as a scientific development; 60 per cent
                        or more expressed themselves as being “very” or “extremely” impressed.
                        People everywhere were more likely to judge a manned landing on the moon
                        important after the accomplish<pb facs="0131" n="79" xml:id="pg_79"/>ment
                        than before. In France, the percentage who thought it important increased by
                        24 percentage points (from 47 to 71 per cent). After the mission, the belief
                        that a moon landing would benefit other countries increased by at least ten
                        percentage points in each country, and by as much as 16 points in France and
                        Venezuela. Except in Japan, respondents exhibited a slightly greater
                        interest than before the moon landing in having the U.S. continue its space
                        efforts. At the same time roughly one-half of the sampled populations
                        (somewhat more in France, fewer in India) felt the U.S. should devote more
                        time and money to problems here on earth.</p>

                            the features of the U.S. presence there which was most strongly
                            criticized by the Thai was the extent to which the U.S. information
                            program is carrying on activities which more properly belong to the Thai
                            and which in effect put the United States in the position of acting as a
                            special pleader on behalf of the Royal Thai Government to the Thai
                            people. In particular, the operations of <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                                >USIS</gloss> Mobile Information Teams were cited as a case in

                        <p>I believe it would be a comparatively simple process to withdraw the

                            operations and activities of the sort which have brought criticism from
                            the Thai. We could anticipate quick dividends in improving U.S.-Thai
                            relations and in making the United States presence in Thailand more
                            tolerable. In addition, we would be responding to your guidelines on
                            giving the Thai the primary responsibility for coping with subversion in

                        International Educational and Cultural Affairs, the Board of Foreign
                        Scholarships, and the American Council on Education. At the opening session
                        the group discussed the question of organization of the U.S. Government’s
                        educational and cultural programs overseas. Focal point was the proposal,
                        made in recent years by the Advisory Commission and several other academic
                        groups, to create a new quasi-public body akin to the British Council<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d36fn2">Founded during the 1930s and granted a Royal

                            nations.</note> for administering these programs (including <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s cultural activities). Proponents of
                        this approach decided not to push it at the present time, but to concentrate
                        instead on strengthening <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>’s programs
                        within the Department of State. The reasons were: (1) greater confidence in
                        the leadership of <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> under the new
                        administration, and (2) realization of the difficulties of getting
                        legislation to set up a new body.</p>
                    <p>There was also considerable discussion of the purposes of international
                        educational and cultural exchange; several participants felt that a new
                        rationale was necessary. While some feeble pleas were made in favor of
                        individual grants to promote pure scholarship for the sake of scholarship,
                        there was a clear consensus that the thrust of the program should be
                        directed to institution building. Most of those present seemed to feel that
                        university-to-university arrangements should constitute the major part of
                        the exchange program. Though the issue of “relevance” was recognized, there
                        was a clear consensus that the fields of study included in these
                        institution-building programs should be allowed to <pb facs="0135" n="83"
                            xml:id="pg_83"/> cover a far broader range than in the project-oriented
                        programs of the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>There was an astonishing atmosphere of realism in the discussions regarding
                        the fundamental rationale of the government’s international educational and
                        cultural programs. One of the working papers by <persName corresp="#p_HRA_1"
                            >Richard A. Humphrey</persName>, of the American Council on Education,
                        had stressed that the government could not be expected to finance such
                        programs other than to serve the “public interest in the setting of our
                        relations with other countries.”<note n="3" xml:id="d36fn3">Not found and
                            not further identified.</note> It is reported that Assistant Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RJ_1">John Richardson</persName> had made the same
                        point before the Board of Foreign Scholarships on the previous day. In any
                        case, the conferees of September 12th clearly accepted this as a basis of
                        their discussion.</p>
                    <p>In the final session there was quite some discussion on whether the
                        government’s “propaganda agency” ought to be involved in cultural affairs.
                        Beyond some objections to the fact that the exchange program is administered
                        by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officers in the field there were
                        also suggestions that libraries should be detached from the Agency and
                        attached to <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>. The chairman<note n="4"

                        emphasized that the purpose was not to dismantle <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> but entertained with interest the remark that films were
                        no less cultural than libraries. Some of the scholars present clearly had
                        difficulty in understanding the finer points of the organizational <hi

                        expressed the view that informational and cultural activities are not
                        incompatible. Some of those present nodded sympathetically. <persName

                        University, formally withdrew some of his reservations about <gloss

                            >Steven Muller</persName>, of Cornell, predicted that universities would

                        officers. Still, at the end of the session it appeared that none of the

                        role of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>Recognition of existent diversity in international cultural affairs programs,
                        the timeliness of new perspectives, need for new ideas and approaches, the
                        existence of probable bureaucratic slippage, the difficulty of measuring
                        effectiveness, the volatile nature of some artists and their disagreement
                        with Federal policy, need for support from the Secretary of State and the
                        Executive Branch of Government—and consequent hoped-for Congressional
                        support which might follow—were fundamental discussion points. The need to
                        articulate for ourselves and Congress the significance of the vague area of
                        cultural affairs important to world peace and security was also considered.
                        These factors were directed toward the major question of how this group can
                        help to shape contemporary cultural policy which will be instrumental in
                        building a positive future. Integral to these deliberations is the objective
                        of cultural inter-change.</p>
                    <p>This group will address itself as agreed to in the terms of reference “To

                    <p>In line with this thought, as an example of how the group might participate
                        in shaping policy, the question was raised as to whether the <gloss

                        communication with Arab countries during this period of interrupted
                        diplomatic relations. Has the approach been primarily negative? Could we
                        break existent barriers? What could be the role of Government cultural
                        programs in this and similar situations?</p>

                        itself to determining what information is required by whom to make what
                        decision. The need for research and priority determination is motivated by
                        the realization that what is fundamentally important are methods of

                            <persName corresp="#p_BWF_2">Buckley</persName> said he thought the
                        conservative group in this country was becoming increasingly concerned about
                        Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_BWF_2">Buckley</persName> feels that in about

                        Administration. He felt the reason for this was the group’s feeling that the
                        Administration wasn’t being strong enough. In response to a query by
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName>, <persName
                            corresp="#p_BWF_2">Buckley</persName> had said the two-month timetable
                        was pretty definite.</p>
                    <p>(2) <persName corresp="#p_BWF_2">Buckley</persName> had told <persName

                        he had received <persName corresp="#p_BWF_2">Buckley</persName>’s ideas on

                            <persName corresp="#p_BWF_2">Buckley</persName> wondered how his role on

                    <pb facs="0141" n="89" xml:id="pg_89"/>
                    <p>(4) <persName corresp="#p_BWF_2">Buckley</persName>, at the time of their
                        dinner, was anxious to have a chat with K because he said he was puzzled—he
                        had, in response to K’s suggestion, come up with a certain plan of action on
                        the matter discussed by K with him. K had said it wasn’t a good plan of
                        action. K said he planned to take this up with <persName corresp="#p_BWF_2"
                            >Buckley</persName> at dinner.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName> then said he wanted to
                        mention one final piece of intelligence. When he was in Vietnam, he was
                        immensely disturbed at the caliber of the reporters, and the reporting,
                        going on. He felt at that time that the Laos and Thailand situations were
                        going to blow as a result of conversations he had. When he got back, he told
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFN_1">Stanton</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_BWF_2">Buckley</persName> as members of the Advisory
                        Commission to take a look at Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. They both agreed to
                        do it. Now <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName> has <persName
                            corresp="#p_BWF_2">Buckley</persName> locked in—he is going to visit the
                        three countries November 28 through December 5; and <persName
                            corresp="#p_SFN_1">Stanton</persName> will probably be put on the same
                        trip. In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1"
                            >Shakespeare</persName> asked K’s advice as to who they should talk
                        with. K said he would put something together on that, and that he would give
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWF_2">Buckley</persName> total support. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName> said he knew K would; and he
                        had felt safe in posturing it.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName> said he was making a
                        speech tomorrow, and one of the things he is going to talk about is the
                        Voice of America, touching on what they are doing in Eastern Europe—the
                        Munich transmitter and its value since they are jamming us, and since it
                        will also come in on the Moscow wavelength in Eastern Europe. He asked K if
                        he thought it would be safe to say that. K suggested he take it fairly
                        easy—not make a big issue of it; especially with the new government in
                        Germany he might get into severe trouble with them.<note n="7"

                    <p>On October 13, 1969, the United States Information Agency (<gloss

                        entitled “October 15 Moratorium on the Viet-Nam War.” The Note, drafted in

                        Assistant Cultural Affairs Adviser <persName corresp="#p_GG_2">Geoffrey

                            corresp="#p_PJ_2">John Pauker</persName>, outlined the nature of the
                        nationwide protest called for by the Vietnam Moratorium Committee (<gloss
                            target="#t_VMC_1">VMC</gloss>) and specified the guidelines for <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> treatment of the moratorium:</p>
                    <p>“It is no secret abroad that within the United States there is opposition to
                        U.S. policy in Viet-Nam. We have reported manifestations of that opposition
                        before, matter-of-factly and in perspective in order to balance sensational
                        commercial coverage. The coming moratorium will be another manifestation of
                        that opposition, and should be treated in the same way.</p>
                    <p>“Specifically, we want foreign audiences to view the activities relating to
                        the moratorium in light of the many positive efforts of the U.S. Government,
                        and of the President himself, to reduce the violence in Viet-Nam and end the
                        war.</p>
                    <p>“You should gear the volume of output about the moratorium to the
                        requirements of credibility and the newsworthiness of the developments,
                        bearing in mind President <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName>’s
                        recent call for national unity in support of the Administration’s Viet-Nam
                        policy. In original comment, to set the stage for the moratorium and also
                        while it proceeds, make the following points:</p>
                    <p>“With the President, all Americans want to end the war:</p>
                    <p>“‘I want to end this war. The American people want to end this war.’ (Address
                        to the nation, May 14, 1969.)</p>
                    <p>“The question is how this can best be done. Organizers of the <gloss
                            target="#t_VMC_1">VMC</gloss> propose speedier unilateral withdrawal of
                        U.S. forces. Others—most recently Senators <persName corresp="#p_GB_1"
                            >Goldwater</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TJ_2"
                        >Tower</persName>—advocate intensified conventional military pressures on
                        the enemy. Many other Americans have varying views between these
                        positions.</p>
                    <p>“The President has stated that ‘we have ruled out attempting to impose a
                        purely military solution on the battlefield.’ In his efforts to arrive at a
                        disengagement, the President has put forth only one condition which is not
                        negotiable: the right of the people of South Viet-Nam freely to determine

                        people is met, the President has publicly set forth these three criteria for
                        the disengagement of U.S. troops from Viet-Nam:</p>
                    <p>“(1) Progress at the Paris talks.</p>
                    <p>“(2) Reduction in the intensity of combat.</p>

                    <p>“The rights of free speech, assembly and petition are guaranteed and
                        protected by the U.S. Constitution and by American democratic traditions. It
                        is clear that the Federal Government will not interfere with the protests as
                        long as they are peaceful and do not interfere with the right of other
                        citizens to pursue their own activities.</p>
                    <p>“If violence should occur it will be detrimental not only to the aims of the

                            corresp="#p_RJ_1">John Richardson</persName>, who raised the question of
                        what more we can do to draw <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> closer together.</p>
                    <p>We agreed that a most important step was better joint planning of our
                        programs. For example, the <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> budget
                        presentation made to the Bureau of the Budget last week should have been
                        discussed with <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. We should also
                        reciprocate and keep <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> informed of our new
                        priorities and major program decisions. Coordination should be both at an
                        area level and between <gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> and the
                        Assistant Secretary’s office.</p>
                    <p>(On this point, I understand that the Bureau of the Budget asked <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> whether its proposals had been cleared with
                        us, and asked our Area Directors the same question at their presentations
                        this week. The answer was no; the Areas will pursue this with their
                        counterparts in <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>, and Ken should pursue it
                        with <persName corresp="#p_IF_1">Fred Irving</persName>.)<note n="3"

                            with the word “Areas.”</note></p>
                    <p>We mentioned <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s plans for <gloss

                        and the likelihood of having one or more pilot posts as the systems develop.
                        John said he would like to include <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> in
                        these pilot projects.</p>
                    <p>We also discussed the possibility of having a single country plan for <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts, broad enough to encompass both
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                            >CU</gloss> objectives. I suggested that it might be useful for a small

                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> to spend a day talking about the formulation

                            <persName corresp="#p_SIL_1">Irving Sablosky</persName> to draw up a

                    <p>We also discussed briefly the need to reduce <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"

                    <p>II. The group agreed that the Asia Foundation is worthy of continued

                    <p>III. The group supported the concept that there should be dramatic evidence
                        of the President’s concern with the quality of living as expressed through

                        formulate what is to be said.<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">The agenda for the
                            November 3 International Cultural Strategy Group meeting indicated that
                            the Group would address several items discussed during the October 20
                            meeting, including the development of an administration policy on
                            cultural affairs. Attached to the agenda is an October 22 memorandum

                                >CU</gloss>, adding that the “public support” for these programs
                            “has come from citizens in all walks of life who give a high priority to
                            efforts to improve the quality of life in America and for efforts to
                            improve the image of American life among peoples in other parts of the
                            world.” He proposed a “<hi rend="italic">dramatic</hi> increase” in
                            funds for these programs, an expansion of the Department of State’s
                            cultural activities, and development of “some sort of formula” in order
                            to direct a fixed amount or percentage of money for these activities.
                            Concerning the latter, <persName corresp="#p_MCK_1">McWhorter</persName>
                            stated, “It may well be that the Administration would want to come up
                            with some descriptive phrase or slogan for this new emphasis such as

                        if it would be favorable, by all means do it. S said they could carefully
                        select the people who would appear. K asked if S had read the speech. S read
                        the first draft and thought that it would be a good speech.</p>
                    <p>#2 S was leaving tomorrow (Friday) for India and West Germany. <persName

                        mission in New Delhi—about 80–90 people also talk to Mrs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GI_1">Gandhi</persName>. Was there anything S should know in
                        speaking to Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Gandhi</persName>. I indicated
                        that S should tell her not to be mislead by the press on Vietnam. The
                        President has come as far as he is going, he is very determined, it is now
                        necessary for Hanoi to make a move. Told S to be tough with no apologies. S
                        agreed completely with that. K added that the President will be in office
                        for three more years no matter what happens. S asked if he could refer to
                        this conversation with K in his discussion with Mrs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GI_1">Gandhi</persName>. K asked if there would be an
                        Embassy man there and S said only <persName corresp="#p_KKB_1"
                            >Keating</persName> and he would follow any rules S set up. K indicated
                        that in that case S could mention the conversation but <persName
                            corresp="#p_KKB_1">Keating</persName> should leave his name out of his
                        reports.</p>
                    <p>#3 He is going to Germany to look over their facilities. He will go to Berlin
                        to discuss Radio Free Europe with his counter parts (Alles). K said he was a
                        friend of his and S should pass on his regards. S asked <pb facs="0148"
                            n="96" xml:id="pg_96"/> if K recalled S’s talk with the <gloss

                        will probably bring it up with the West Germans. There is also increasing
                        unhappiness with DOA. Since there are no trade discussions between East
                        Germany and Poland, S thinks it is almost certain that the continued
                        existence of transistors on German soil will come up.<note n="5"

                        said he would sit tight and listen. K said S should tell them these things
                        as if they were every day issues and very natural and that we have no

                    <p>As part of its work, the Commission has heard detailed presentations from
                        three major cities—Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.—which seek the

                        the opportunity for a similar presentation. Meanwhile, the Commission is in

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">PURPOSE</p>
                    <p>The Media Review Committee as part of its continuing effort to review,
                        analyze and evaluate media output of the Agency, has completed a survey of
                        the Agency treatment of the Vietnam Moratorium of October 15. The Committee
                        concerned itself with two main issues: (1) The adequacy of the Agency Policy
                        directives as they affected media coverage of the event, and (2) the
                        adequacy of the Media Elements in covering the event within the framework of
                        Agency Policy.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">PROCEDURE</p>
                    <p>The Committee studied the <gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> News Policy
                        Note issued October 13<note n="2" xml:id="d47fn2">See <ref target="#d40"
                                >Document 40</ref>.</note> and an extensive (almost all-inclusive)
                        sampling of Agency media output on the Moratorium.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">CONCLUSIONS</p>
                    <p>Though some members of the Committee felt that more specific and explicit
                        directive in the News Policy Note may have improved media compliance with
                        Policy, the majority opinion was that the Policy Note gave adequate guidance
                        on the one hand, and sufficient leeway for creative interpretation by media
                        professionals on the other.</p>
                    <p>The Committee was of the unanimous opinion that, while the <hi rend="italic"
                            >extent</hi> of Agency media coverage of the Moratorium was somewhat
                        lacking, the major problem was the almost total lack of <hi rend="italic"
                            >depth</hi> in the existing coverage.</p>
                    <p>The Committee was of the unanimous opinion that any failure to provide the
                        foreign audience and the Post with adequate coverage, background and
                        information was not due to restraints imposed by Policy, but rather to a
                        lack of initiative within the Media Elements.</p>
                    <pb facs="0155" n="103" xml:id="pg_103"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">RECOMMENDATIONS</p>
                    <p>1) Those Agency Media Elements geared toward instantaneous release and
                        distribution of information (<gloss target="#t_IBS_1">IBS</gloss> and parts
                        of <gloss target="#t_IPS_1">IPS</gloss>): (A) Provide more in-depth coverage
                        for their <hi rend="italic">general</hi> audience by utilyzing on-the-spot
                        reporters, news documentary-style wrap-ups, extensive articles (Agency
                        authored or commissioned), interviews with non-government public figures,
                        and more use of Editorial Roundups from various U.S. Newspapers. (B) Provide
                        more extensive and in-depth information and background for <hi rend="italic"
                            >staff</hi> use at Posts.</p>
                    <p>2) Those Agency Media Elements not concerned primarily with instantaneous
                        distribution: (A) Plan for future use of materials, at least in a general
                        way, by recording some of the events of the day (B) Outline future use so
                        that specific events, interviews, etc. relevant to a final product or
                        viewpoint may be obtained.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is the Analysis section of the report.]</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">SUMMARY</p>
                    <p>The Committee has attempted to study the Agency coverage of the October 15th
                        Moratorium primarily from the standpoint of the News Policy Note which
                        states in part: “You should gear the volume of output about the Moratorium
                        to the requirements of credibility and the newsworthiness of the
                        developments . . .” As stated above, our criticism is only slightly directed
                        toward the “volume” of Agency coverage, but definitely toward its
                        fulfillment of the “requirements of credibility.” It is the judgement of the
                        Committee that more in-depth coverage of the Moratorium would have reversed
                        the negative reports received from some Posts.</p>
                    <p>In a cable from Moscow, for example, it was related that <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> was rated third by Russian newspapers
                        comparing coverage of the Moratorium by West German Broadcasting, <gloss
                            target="#t_BBC_1">BBC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>.
                        A similar report was received from Warsaw.<note n="3" xml:id="d47fn3">The
                            cables were not found.</note></p>
                    <p>These Post responses are mentioned at the end of this study because they open
                        the door to other problems. Every Media Element does not always take
                        advantage of the potential for extensive coverage and creative
                        interpretation provided by an objective, open Policy Note. Nor does every
                        Post receive all of the materials which are initiated by the Media Elements
                        in Washington.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Agency media coverage of the October 15 Moratorium, the
                        distance between Policy and Post was not bridged as well as it should have
                        been by the Media Elements.</p>

                    <p>You will recall that the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars was
                        established by Act of Congress last year to be “a living institution
                        expressing the ideals and concerns of Woodrow Wilson . . . symbolizing and
                        strengthening the fruitful relation between the world of learning and the

                    <p>Congress placed the Center in the Smithsonian Institution under the
                        administration of its own Board of Trustees who were appointed subsequently
                        by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> and yourself as
                        listed below. I was designated Chairman of the Board.</p>
                    <p>Your own message to Congress on District of Columbia affairs last April gave
                        us a strong start by declaring that “an international center for scholars to
                        be established as a living memorial to Woodrow Wilson . . . could hardly be
                        a more appropriate memorial to a President who combined a devotion to
                        scholarship with a passion for peace. The <pb facs="0157" n="105"
                            xml:id="pg_105"/> District has long sought, and long needed, a center
                        for both men of letters and men of affairs.<note n="3" xml:id="d48fn3">In
                            his April 28 special message to the Congress on the District of
                            Columbia, <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName> stated: “One of
                            the most significant additions to Pennsylvania Avenue will be an
                            international center for scholars, to be established as a living
                            memorial to Woodrow Wilson in the area just north of the National
                            Archives. There could hardly be a more appropriate memorial to a
                            President who combined a devotion to scholarship with a passion for
                            peace. The District has long sought, and long needed, a center for both
                            men of letters and men of affairs. This should be, as it was first
                            proposed, ‘an institution of learning that the 22nd Century will regard
                            as having influenced the 21st.’” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers:

                    <p>Because of the generalized nature of the statute creating the Center and its
                        legislative history, the Board and its staff spent seven months in extensive
                        correspondence and discussions to determine the needs of scholars visiting
                        the District and how best to fulfill a unique and useful public purpose
                        within the broad goals of the presidential memorial institution framework. I
                        personally devoted considerable time to this effort in correspondence and in
                        discussions here and abroad. I think we have obtained substantial
                        Congressional support.</p>
                    <p>At our Board meeting last month, at which Secretaries <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FRH_2"
                            >Finch</persName> were ably represented, the Trustees approved the
                        opening in October of 1970 of new international fellowship and guest scholar
                        programs in prime space which has been offered to the Center in the newly
                        renovated original Smithsonian Institution building. Those programs and
                        plans are described in the attached brochure, which includes the above quote
                        from your April message to Congress.<note n="4" xml:id="d48fn4">Not found
                            attached.</note> The brochure has been mailed to a large number of
                        institutions and individuals in this country and elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>I think the fellowship program we have designed [is] unique and desirable in
                        scope and purpose. When the program is fully operational, up to forty
                        distinguished scholars—approximately half from the United States and half
                        from other countries—will be selected to work and study here for periods
                        ranging from a few weeks to several years. They will be chosen—again in
                        approximately equal measure—from many traditional academic disciplines and
                        from a variety of non-academic occupations and professions such as
                        government, law, business, journalism, etc.</p>
                    <p>The theme of the program is designed to accentuate those aspects of <persName
                            corresp="#p_WH_1">Wilson</persName>’s ideals and concerns for which he
                        is perhaps best remembered a half century after his presidency—his search
                        for international peace and the imaginative new governmental approaches he
                        used to meet pressing issues of his day. We are determined to concentrate
                        our efforts here on studies of some of the big issues of our times which are
                        simply <pb facs="0158" n="106" xml:id="pg_106"/> not getting the attention
                        they deserve in governments or in the institutions of higher education.</p>
                    <p>For these purposes we have submitted a modest and carefully reviewed budget
                        estimate for fiscal year 1971 totalling $900,000, including $400,000 for
                        equipping the Center and administrative support and $500,000 to finance
                        twenty fellowships. We have set our sights on raising from private sources
                        at least another $500,000 to finance the other twenty fellows, and if we do
                        better than that we will be able to reduce the federal sums requested for
                        this purpose accordingly. We are setting up a bipartisan outside advisory
                        committee to assist us in this development effort.</p>
                    <p>We were advised today of the tentative decision of the Bureau of the Budget
                        to provide no funds for the Center in the coming fiscal year and informed
                        that this issue would be presented to you in a few days. I do not know the
                        Bureau’s reasoning, and obviously there is no point in my addressing this
                        issue in terms of dollars and cents.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, I am convinced that we have laid the groundwork here to create
                        something of significant national and international import which will have
                        value in terms of cultural exchanges and education, and, most importantly,
                        in new approaches to some of the staggering problems confronting all
                        advanced societies today. I ask your support in reinstating the original
                        budget request submitted by the Board of Trustees of the Woodrow Wilson
                        International Center.</p>

                        your November 3 speech. This film has aroused considerable press and

                    <p>Through the Board and Executive Committee meetings so far held, and extensive
                        staff work, progress has been made in delineating functions of the Center
                        and planning an opening in the Fall of 1970 in temporary space offered to
                        the Center in the original Smithsonian Institution building.<note n="8"
                            xml:id="d51fn8">Reference is to the Smithsonian Institution building
                            known as the “Castle,” designed by architect James Renwick Jr. and
                            completed in 1855.</note> This progress can continue only as funds can
                        be made available.</p>
                    <p>The Department believes the consideration of funding for <gloss

                        opportunity this project, already well begun, provides to contribute to our
                        foreign relations, to wit:</p>
                    <p>1. A national memorial to Woodrow Wilson can appropriately serve the
                        interests of international scholars. <persName corresp="#p_WH_1"
                            >Wilson</persName>’s memory is most closely identified with
                        international peace and scholarship.</p>
                    <p>2. International scholarly efforts, encouraged through such a center, can
                        contribute to new cooperative approaches to human problems common to more
                        than one continent—among them, the basic issues raised by illiteracy,
                        hunger, overpopulation, urban problems, et al.—as well as in fields of
                        lesser urgency but nonetheless affording the basis for significant scholarly
                        cooperation and communication.</p>
                    <p>In view of the plans so far made and already given wide circulation, and the
                        Executive endorsement given last April to this memorial,<note n="9"

                    </list>
                    <p>Recent internal and external criticism of Agency book selection procedures
                        points out a serious shortcoming in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        policy which has disturbed younger officers for some time: The Agency is not
                        helping <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Posts obtain as varied a
                        selection of its books as they should have. The Agency has unnecessarily
                        shied away from controversial books, conservative as well as liberal. While
                        we can not carry all books, the Posts should be able to demonstrate to their
                        audiences the great range of thought in America, and the confidence we have
                        that free expression of ideas—even if these ideas are offensively stated or
                        radical departures from current norms—is central to the democratic
                        process.</p>
                    <p>We believe that adoption of the following suggestions would substantially
                        improve the Agency’s book selection procedures:</p>
                    <p>1) Criteria for selecting “program books” should include: The book’s utility
                        to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> objectives in different countries;
                        the importance of a book as representative of the views of a significant
                        group in America; the book’s relevance to concerns of people in other
                        countries; the book’s prize and literary significance (Pulitzer Prize,
                        National Book Award, the review of major journals can be useful in this
                        respect.)</p>
                    <p>2) <gloss target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss> should inform PAOs of all books
                        reviewed by the Agency.</p>
                    <p>3) <gloss target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss> should continue to send out “program
                        books,” but PAOs should be allowed to select books from all these reviewed
                        by <gloss target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss>—or from other sources—without <gloss
                            target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss> veto, and without justification. The
                        Agency should rely on the judgments of its PAOs in those matters (if
                        necessary Post-<gloss target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss> differences of opinion
                        should be reviewed at the Area Director level.)</p>
                    <p>4) The Agency should seek advice from scholars and professional people in
                        various fields to assist in selection of titles and improving selection in
                        special areas. Liaison with the Agency “Campus Representatives” might be
                        improved for this purpose.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The National Bicentennial Plan</p>
                    <p>The Commission organized a meeting for the preparation of the American
                        Revolution Bicentennial Plan at Williamsburg November 17–18. Besides the
                        staff of the <gloss target="#t_ARBC_1">ARBC</gloss> and a few private
                        consultants, the participants included representatives of the White House,
                        the several Federal agencies whose heads are ex-officio members of the
                        Commission, and other Federal agencies that have an especial interest in the
                        program. <persName corresp="#p_CPJ_1">Phil Conley</persName> represented the
                        Agency.</p>
                    <p>It was clear from the meeting that the Chairman of the Commission, <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJEW_1">John E. Wallace Sterling</persName> and the
                        Executive Director, <persName corresp="#p_SML_1">Melbourne L.
                            Spector</persName> are worried over the great amount of work yet to be
                        done by the <gloss target="#t_ARBC_1">ARBC</gloss> in the remaining few
                        months. They are prepared to step up pressure on all responsible parties to
                        get the job done properly and on time.</p>
                    <p>The main topics discussed at the meeting were:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Outline of the Commission’s Plan</hi>. The
                        Commission’s staff presented a draft outline of the National Bicentennial
                        Plan. In general terms the outline was approved by the meeting’s
                        participants. In the outline the staff took its lead from several points
                        that President <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName> has emphasized
                        on various occasions. The Bicentennial is an occasion for celebration of the
                        past, but more important it is an opportunity for the American people to
                        rededicate themselves to the ideals of the past and to gird themselves for
                        greater achievement in the future. The report, therefore, will try to give a
                        new interpretation of the Declaration of Independence in terms that are
                        meaningful today and will set national goals for the years between now and
                        1976 and for the century <pb facs="0169" n="117" xml:id="pg_117"/>
                        following. The President has mentioned particularly several areas in which
                        the country can make great progress by 1976: management of our growing
                        abundance, making real our ideals of full opportunity, cleaning up our air
                        and water, balancing our system of transportation, improving our systems of
                        education and health care. Above all, following the President’s injunction,
                        the Bicentennial plan is to concern itself not only with material
                        development but especially with the spiritual quality of American life. The
                        celebration and the search and striving for new goals will involve not just
                        the Federal Government but all the states and local communities, all parts
                        of the society, indeed every person in the country.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Organization for the future work of the Commission</hi>.
                        The Commission now has five Committees: Media; Arts, Humanities, and
                        Science; Commerce and Labor; Events and Exhibitions; and Voluntary, Military
                        and Service Organizations. The primary function of these Committees is to
                        stimulate early planning and programming by state, local, and private
                        organizations and institutions in their respective fields. In the nine weeks
                        the Committees were in existence before the Williamsburg meeting only one
                        had been active. The Williamsburg meeting agreed that each of these
                        Committees needs a full-time assistant, if it is to accomplish its task and
                        the Commission’s Executive Director will examine this question. As a result
                        of his assessment, it is possible that the Commission or the White House
                        will request certain agencies to detail an officer full time to the
                        Commission until July 1970.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Young People and the Bicentennial</hi>. Remarks of
                            <persName corresp="#p_AJD_1">Jim Atwater</persName> of the White House
                        staff led to much discussion of how the Commission can assure that the young
                        people of the country will fully participate in both the celebration and the
                        rededication. There was general fear that unless they have a significant
                        role in planning the program, many important elements in our youth may
                        consider the celebration not “their thing” and stay aloof from or even
                        hostile to the whole program. A Committee of three, including <persName
                            corresp="#p_CPJ_1">Phil Conley</persName>, was set up to advise the
                        Executive Director on this point.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Planning within Departments and Agencies</hi>. Each
                        Agency represented at the Williamsburg meeting was asked to present to the
                        Commission its program for the period from now to 1976. From the discussions
                        at the meeting, it is clear that a great deal of planning and budgeting is
                        going on in various agencies, e.g., Commerce, Interior (National Park
                        Service), Smithsonian, and the Library of Congress. The Smithsonian and the
                        Library of Congress, at least, have set up special staffs solely to plan
                        their institution’s role in the Bicentennial.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">International Aspects of the Bicentennial</hi>. The
                        Department of State was asked by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SML_1"
                            >Spector</persName> to take the lead in developing the international

                        international planning.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s Role in the
                        Bicentennial Period</p>
                    <p>As indicated in the attached outline, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        will have a major role in publicizing and interpreting Bicentennial programs
                        and projects in the U.S., helping in negotiations involving foreign
                        governments or institutions, and carrying out special <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> projects.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations</p>
                    <p>1. The Agency should set immediately adequate machinery for internal
                        planning, coordinating and executing its role in respect to the
                        Bicentennial. The machinery could consist of the following:</p>
                    <p>a. A planning task force should prepare the Agency’s preliminary Bicentennial
                        Plan. The membership of the Bicentennial task force could be similar to the
                        Apollo XI Task Force<note n="2" xml:id="d56fn2">See <ref target="#d25"
                                >Document 25</ref>.</note> and include representation from <gloss
                            target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_IOA_1">IOA</gloss>, and
                        each medium and area office. In order that the Agency’s plan be considered
                        in the National Bicentennial Plan, it should be submitted to the <gloss
                            target="#t_ARBC_1">ARBC</gloss> by February 29, 1970.</p>
                    <p>b. Upon completion of its report, the Bicentennial task force as a formed
                        body can be disbanded, but each Agency element represented on the task force
                        should designate one person to continue to be responsible for stimulating
                        and coordinating all its programs relating to the Bicentennial.</p>
                    <p>c. At some time in the future when the volume of Agency programming and
                        production will have reached a certain height, it will probably be necessary
                        for the Director to appoint an Agency Coordinator for the Bicentennial
                        Celebration.</p>
                    <p>2. If the Agency is called upon to detail an officer to the <gloss
                            target="#t_ARBC_1">ARBC</gloss> staff, it [should] do so.</p>
                    <p>3. The Director in a meeting with his senior staff make clear the following
                        points: a. The importance of the Bicentennial Celebration, b. The tremendous
                        opportunity the Bicentennial offers the Agency to present America’s past,
                        present and future society in favorable light, c. The need for all elements
                        of the Agency to buckle down and develop their recommendations for the
                        Agency’s participation in and exploitation of the Bicentennial during the
                        budget years from now until 1976.</p>

                            Celebration</hi></p>
                        <p>The total number of projects or programs that will be carried on
                            throughout the United States during the period of the Bicentennial
                            Celebration will be beyond counting. Some programs will be frivolous and
                            of only local and ephemeral significance. But a good number will be of
                            international and lasting importance. Only some that are under
                            consideration, study or even negotiation are: Olympics in Denver, Los
                            Angeles, or both; major expositions at Boston, Philadelphia, and/or
                            Washington; international symposia; major music, dance and film
                            festivals; artistic and historical exhibits; competitions in literature
                            and all other arts; commemorative stamp, medals, and coins; 76 or 200
                            new cities; establishment of a national theater; special research and
                            publications programs; international scholarships; a chair of youth
                            hostels.</p>
                        <p>Many of these programs will be occasions of festivity and pride. The
                            Agency will have much to do in publicizing them. But surely <gloss
                                target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s great opportunity lies in seizing
                            upon these occasions and this era to emphasize the ideas and ideals that
                            lay behind this country’s foundation and growth, in presenting to the
                            world the new dedication the President urged upon the nation, the search
                            for new short-term (till 1976) and long-term (1976–2076) goals, and
                            above all programs that will be set in motion to achieve the short-range
                            goals.</p>
                        <p>The Agency’s tasks relating to the Bicentennial can be grouped under five
                            headings:</p>
                        <p>I. Advising <gloss target="#t_ARBC_1">ARBC</gloss> and other agencies on
                            actual or potential foreign opinion in relation to the Bicentennial or
                            specific projects.</p>
                        <p>II. Publicizing and interpreting events of the Bicentennial. This will
                            involve not only publicizing the events to overseas audiences but
                            bringing out their significance.</p>
                        <p>III. Assisting other Federal Agencies, states, municipalities or private
                            institutions in carrying out the international side of their programs.
                            Any <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> program will, of course, be
                            administered in the field by <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>.
                            Furthermore, other Federal agencies, certain state and local
                                governmen<pb facs="0172" n="120" xml:id="pg_120"/>tal or private
                            institutions or organizations will seek the help of the State
                            Department, the Agency, or Embassies in various matters such as
                            borrowing materials from foreign institutions in events to be held in
                            the U.S., negotiation for gifts or other tokens from foreign countries,
                            suggesting that foreign institutions hold exhibits, music festivals, or
                            other programs in their own countries to celebrate our Bicentennial.
                            Regardless of whether the original approach is made to the Department,
                            the Agency, or an Embassy the burden of handling the request in the
                            field will fall on <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>IV. Adaptation or expansion of continuing <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                                >USIA</gloss> programs. Some of these programs may also fit under V
                            below. The following suggestions have already been made by various parts
                            of the Agency:</p>
                        <p>Special <hi rend="italic">Forum</hi> programs<note n="4" xml:id="d56fn4"
                                >Program of broadcast lectures on a variety of subjects.</note></p>
                        <p>Special issues of <hi rend="italic">Dialogue</hi></p>
                        <p>Bibliographies or appropriate subjects</p>
                        <p>A special book translation program for at least all the major languages
                            (French, Spanish, Arabic). The program should cover all periods and all
                            major problems or themes of American history.</p>
                        <p>Series of educational films for high school or college level on American
                            history.</p>
                        <p>V. Special <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Programs. Several
                            suggestions have already been made:</p>
                        <p>A cluster of multi-media programs on such subjects as advancement (and
                            retreat) of individual liberties in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>U.S. concern in the past for liberty and for improvement of the quality
                            of human life outside its own borders.</p>
                        <p>Contributions U.S. has received from abroad—institution, ideas, mores,
                            culture, and financing (railroads, canals, ranches,) etc.</p>
                        <p>U.S. contribution to mankind’s culture.</p>
                        <p>Development of the ideal of free education for all children.</p>
                        <p>Development of the arts in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Awards for the best foreign books or university theses in American
                            history, government, political system, etc.</p>
                        <p>Establishment and strengthening of research or documentation in centers
                            overseas, drawing upon the new library techniques.</p>
                        <p>International, regional or national conferences on various themes
                            relating to the American Revolution.</p>
                        <pb facs="0173" n="121" xml:id="pg_121"/>
                        <p>Publications of collections of essays by distinguished foreign leaders
                            and intellectuals on the American contribution to the world, especially
                            in the spiritual and cultural realms.</p>
                        <p>The Agency should also back appropriate projects that <gloss
                                target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> may propose, such as, at least one major
                            bicentennial festival of the performing arts in each area and
                            establishment of commemorative chairs in American studies at foreign
                            universities.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">OBJECTIVE 1: Builds an understanding of contemporary
                        America presenting balanced, multi-faceted views of American
                        culture—encompassing its history, institutions, achievements, aspirations,
                        and problems.</p>
                    <p>Agency field personnel should have an intuitive, almost instinctive grasp of
                        this objective. And it is particularly imperative that stateside Agency
                        employees, especially those directly involved with media output have a fine
                        sensitivity for this objective and implement it daily.</p>
                    <p>The dramatic events and happenings of modern America are highlighted all over
                        the world in a multitude of ways by non-<gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> sources. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is
                        responsible for interpreting the modern American scene so that foreign
                        audiences can place events in proper historical and contemporary
                        perspective. Because the United States is a major world power in the
                        political, economic, and military spheres, American culture—its dynamism as
                        well as its weaknesses—is felt in most areas of the world. <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s presentation of American society must
                        reflect that very diversity from which the United States derives its
                        strength. And in selecting those elements of American life to portray to
                        foreign audiences, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        <pb facs="0174" n="122" xml:id="pg_122"/> should seek out and present the
                        views of responsible prominent persons outside the Agency, and indeed
                        outside the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Presenting a balanced and multi-faceted view of the United States means that
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> recognizes the pride Americans
                        take in their society’s open nature which stimulates dissent and diversity
                        and encourages or even invites self-criticism. The essence of America’s
                        strength is that there is no single government approved version of the
                        United States. Striving to portray balanced views of contemporary America
                        does not mean to suggest that everything the Agency does must reflect
                        perfect harmony and balance on every side of an issue or that output must be
                        weighted to the ideological ounce. On the contrary, <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should avoid this dull bland fudge which
                        tries to offend no one and succeeds admirably in boring everyone.</p>
                    <p>If discussion, sharp clear dialogue, and dissent are recognized as among
                        America’s more prominent assets, then they should be presented as such in a
                        lucid, coherent manner to foreign audiences. It must be emphasized that the
                        above refers to a presentation of domestic American life and not to foreign
                        posture or policy which <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has to
                        portray in a unified manner speaking as the official voice of the American
                        government. Where a conflict exists between the proper portrayal of domestic
                        American events and the expediencies of U.S. foreign policy, where there is
                        a conflict between this goal and the goal calling for the defense of U.S.
                        foreign policy, the approach must be left to the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1"
                            >PAO</gloss> given his understanding of the special forces coming into
                        play in the host country. Material fulfilling both objectives should be
                        supplied by the Agency.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">OBJECTIVE 2: Encourages understanding and support by
                        other nations of United States foreign policy objectives as enunciated by
                        the President and the Secretary of State.</p>
                    <p>The wording of the above mission statement is designed to correspond to the
                        realistic possibilities of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> operations
                        affecting foreign attitudes or actions relative to U.S. foreign policy
                        objectives. The tone “encourages” signals modesty, modesty in that <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> probably can do little more in its

                        specific foreign policy issue. The goal implies a whole range of
                        possibilities, from the simple presentation of information to the hope that
                        “understanding and support”, as revealed in attitudes and actions, will

                    <p>The foreign policy interests of nations cannot always be expected to
                        coincide, but there are basic human concerns that do. Humanity faces common
                        problems—violence, poverty, overpopulation, depletion of natural resources,
                        the destruction of the environment, to name the major ones—that must be
                        solved in common. Communication has a limited role to play in the solution

                        agency goal.</p>
                    <p>In the past we have always regarded development as a need of the
                        underdeveloped world, and thus have directed our “National Development”
                        activities to those countries only. If the Agency is to <pb facs="0176"
                            n="124" xml:id="pg_124"/> continue to play a role in development, it
                        must recognize that development is a world-wide problem, not only because
                        the problems of the poorer nations affect the rest of the international
                        community, but because the industrialized nations themselves have reached a
                        new level of technology which has created a whole new set of developmental
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>In contributing to the exchange “of information, skills and experience to

                        appropriate fields, such as health, demography, urbanology; in general, all
                        areas of activity from the cultural to the social and physical sciences
                        which relate to development and the improvement of the quality of life.</p>
                    <p>This is not to say that the Agency officer, in order to function properly
                        within this goal, must be a developmental expert. It is, however, important
                        and reasonable to assume that officials whose commodity is their country’s
                        culture should be aware of the problems their country faces, and efforts
                        made toward their solutions.</p>
                    <p>Besides being a point of contact between the U.S. and the other countries in
                        these various fields—an area where our cultural exchange program must play a
                        very important role—<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should be a
                        conduit for information from governmental and non-governmental sources which

                    <p>This demands an understanding on the part of every <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> officer of the problems of the host country, the

                        international community and the United States in political, economic and
                        cultural affairs; in other words, an extremely perceptive officer, and an
                        intelligent listener able to act on what he has heard, able to pull together
                        many resources in the country in which he works as well as his own

                    <p>Mutuality of interest can only be achieved through genuine dialogue. Often in

                        local customs. This superficiality has especially repelled the intellectual
                        leaders <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has tried to reach. A genuine
                        sensitivity to, and appreciation of the social, scientific and cultural
                        achievements of the host country will help foster the mutual respect so

                        closely a desired state of affairs than a current reality.</p>
                    <p>That this is the case is due to factors beyond and within the Agency’s
                        control. Of the former, the attitudes of the President and the Department of
                        State are the most crucial. That is, both must want the kind of counsel that
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is capable of providing. This
                        implies more than just a close relationship between the Agency Director and
                        the President. Personal friendship and political ties are no guarantee of
                        systematic policy involvement. On the inter-agency level, the Department of
                        State has frequently either ignored or remained hostile to the consideration
                        of psychological and public opinion factors in foreign policy
                        decision-making. Too often, the Department’s concern with foreign public
                        opinion has occurred only in crisis situations—when foreign emotions are
                        high and when communications with foreign audiences are often least
                        effective. In the last analysis each President structures the policy process
                        to suit his own preferences, and without a clear indication that the
                        Agency’s counsel is both a desirable and necessary part of that process,
                        maximum realization of this objective at all levels is impossible.</p>
                    <p>But to a significant extent the existing situation is also a result of
                        factors which are within the Agency’s control. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> has developed a high degree of professionalism and
                        expertise in its communications to foreign audiences; it has not done so in
                        the area of policy formulation. Emphasis on overseas activities and on
                        providing administrative and program support for them has resulted in a
                        failure to develop the requisite amount of skilled personnel necessary to
                        enable the Agency’s leadership to fulfill its counseling function. In
                        addition, the Agency has all too often had little of relevance to
                        contribute. In large part this has been a consequence of inadequate
                        research. Opinion surveys which were not always analyzed in depth, a
                        tendency to conduct surveys oriented to worldwide comparisons rather than
                        issues pertinent to particular regions or countries, and the subordination
                        of country and area expertise to survey research techniques have lead in the
                        past to <pb facs="0178" n="126" xml:id="pg_126"/> research findings which
                        were frequently superficial and lacking in guidance on long-range trends in
                        foreign public opinion.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> also has not consistently sought to
                        place experienced officers in positions to offer counsel at key points and
                        at the highest levels in other departments and agencies dealing with foreign
                        affairs. Too frequently Agency personnel are assigned to Office of Public
                        Information where their knowledge and sensitivity to foreign opinion have
                        little or no impact on policy as it is being formulated. If maximum
                        effectiveness is to be achieved, Agency officers must be strategically
                        placed to deal with problems and issues before, rather than after, they
                        reach communications channels.</p>
                    <p>Broadening of the Agency’s counseling role is as desirable in the field as it
                        is in Washington. This means, in addition to a close working relationship
                        between the Ambassador and the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>, that a
                        continuing dialogue be maintained between Agency officers at all levels and
                        other members of the Embassy staff. Not only will this lead to the more
                        effective carrying out of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s own
                        programs, but officers representing other agencies and functions can benefit
                        if they are kept constantly aware of information opportunities, the
                        communication channels open to them and the potential consequences of their
                        actions on foreign public opinion.</p>
                    <p>It is a truism to state that cross cultural communication and public opinion
                        are important components of modern diplomacy. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> possesses a legitimate competence in these areas and this
                        competence should be as much a part of the policy process as the more
                        traditional military, economic and political influences. The Agency’s
                        participation in policy formulation should be more than to act simply as a
                        conduit for a specialized kind of intelligence. Its information and counsel
                        on the psychological dimension of foreign policy should be an integral part
                        of the policy formulation process at all levels both in Washington and in
                        the field.</p>

                    <p>It is evident that careful criteria governing the selection of books for our

                        instance, it has come to my attention that in the case of some books,
                        Country Public Affairs Officers cannot obtain them unless they justify their
                        requests in each case. I find that certain books by eminent Americans, such

                    <p>In handling the results of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>-sponsored
                        opinion polls conducted abroad, we are committed publicly and on the record
                        to three policies:</p>
                    <p>1) Poll results while still classified as “Confidential”, will be made
                        available upon request to the chairmen of the appropriate Congressional
                        committees and subcommittees and to the ranking minority members of these
                        committees, with the understanding that the results will not be made
                        public.</p>
                    <p>2) Polls classified as “Confidential” will be automatically declassified two
                        years after their completion, and those classified “Limited Official Use”
                        one year after completion, unless at that time the interests of national
                        security requires them to remain classified.</p>
                    <p>3) The Agency will not engage in selective release of poll findings.</p>
                    <p>The first two of these policies were worked out between <persName

                        Subcommittee on International Organizations and Movements of the Committee

                                >Scott</persName>.</note> The Senator had requested that the Agency
                        cancel the agreement between <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and the
                        House Government Information Subcommittee on the delayed release of U.S.
                        Government polls. He <pb facs="0184" n="132" xml:id="pg_132"/> based his
                        demand on the charge that the Agency had leaked results of a Confidential
                        poll to <gloss target="#t_AP_1">AP</gloss> because the poll showed U.S.
                        prestige to be high in Europe. Senator <persName corresp="#p_SFA_1"
                            >Scott</persName> urged “immediate publication of all prestige polls”,
                        but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> politely stuck by the
                        new policy.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">The reasons for delaying public release of our poll
                            results</hi> were well stated by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER_1"
                            >Murrow</persName> in his testimony before the Subcommittee on
                        International Organizations and Movements. Said Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName>: “These polls are only valuable if
                        they represent an honest count. For this reason we use indigenous
                        organizations to conduct the polls. The polls are not identified as being
                        done for the U.S. Government. Such identification by release too soon after
                        their being taken would inhibit an open and candid response for those
                        interviewed next time around. Also, there could well be embarrassment to the
                        government of the country in which the poll was taken. Indeed, the release
                        of certain information could seriously compromise our diplomatic
                        position.”</p>
                    <p>To the question on <hi rend="italic">why we do these polls</hi>, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> said: “the purpose of the
                        research is to try to determine to a large measure the areas of suspicion,
                        confusion, uncertainty, in order that we can better tailor the output of our
                        various mediums to meet these criticisms or misunderstanding.”</p>
                    <p>To sum up, the Moss Agreement does not prevent us from releasing polls before
                        the two years are up. But the pledge given to Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_SFA_1">Scott</persName>—not to mention the possible
                        reactions of other Congressmen—argues against using poll data to show how
                        well we are doing unless we are prepared to release all poll results from
                        these countries relevant to U.S. standing. This might be advantageous in
                        view of the generally favorable tenor of the results obtained in our recent
                        surveys. But it would set a precedent which could force the Agency to
                        publish results the next time we do such surveys even if such results might
                        reflect unfavorably upon the Administration. In the long run, the present
                        arrangement would seem to serve better the interests of the Agency and of
                        the Administration in power.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DK_1">Douglas</persName>’ plan is basically to
                        establish a firm well organized tour that would have permanence over a

                        trips and successes particularly with overseas students. He feels rather
                        frustrated with the “ad hoc” arrangements of the past whereby his trips
                        materialized only because he personally made the effort and not because of
                        U.S. Government awareness of the potential of such programs.</p>
                    <p>He is opposed to Film Festival participation because “they are considered

                    <p>Circular Infoguide No. 69-22. Subject: The Path to Peace</p>
                    <p>1. The path to peace in Viet-Nam has been charted in a series of recent
                        statements by President <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName>. In
                        discussions and output, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should
                        reflect realistically the progress achieved toward peace, and confidence in
                        the course that has been chosen. Our tone should be one of cautious
                        optimism.</p>
                    <p>2. The President, in concert with the Republic of Viet-Nam, has outlined
                        alternate plans to achieve a just peace: through a negotiated settlement if
                        possible, or through continued Vietnamization if necessary. He ruled out a
                        precipitate withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Viet-Nam.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d63fn2">Reference is to the President’s November 3 address; see
                                <ref target="#d45fn2">footnote 2, Document 45</ref>. The President
                            addressed the nation on December 15 regarding progress on Vietnamization
                            and the troop withdrawal program; for the text, see <hi rend="italic"
                                >Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName>,
                                1969</hi>, pp. 1025–1028.</note></p>
                    <pb facs="0188" n="136" xml:id="pg_136"/>
                    <p>3. Even though debate over the best means to achieve peace will continue, as
                        is inherent in a democratic society, the unity of the nation and its leaders
                        in their desire to end the conflict is not open to question.</p>
                    <p>4. To promote a better understanding abroad of the key issues of peace and
                        war in Viet-Nam, Agency media should give increased attention to these major
                        points:</p>
                    <p>a. The Republic of Viet-Nam is continuing to show substantial progress in its
                        economic, social and political development. These accomplishments—in
                        addition to growing South Vietnamese military strength—enhance South
                        Viet-Nam’s status as a sovereign, independent and viable state.</p>
                    <p>b. Hanoi has miscalculated the desire of the South Vietnamese people for
                        self-determination. Evidence of that desire is readily apparent in the
                        persistence of South Viet-Nam’s nation-building efforts while engaged in a
                        stubborn defense of its freedom.</p>
                    <p>c. Hanoi and its supporters have misread minority agitation in the U.S. They
                        appear to think that a vocal minority can bypass the processes of American
                        democracy, including an open society’s primary means of political
                        expression—the ballot box. The strength of our society is built on freedom
                        of expression. This means that any American has the right to express,
                        without fear, opinions that differ from those held by others, including his
                        elected leaders. President <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName>
                        sympathizes with the idealism of critics at home and fully shares their
                        desire for peace. Under his oath of office the President must act in
                        accordance with his best judgment of the interest of the nation as a whole.
                        He cannot permit a vocal segment of the population to sway this judgment,
                        particularly when it has been endorsed as sound by a majority of the
                        people.</p>
                    <p>d. While Communist prisoners of war have access to the resources of the Red
                        Cross and other rights to which they are entitled, American POWs held in
                        North Viet-Nam are denied the humane treatment required by international
                        conventions to which Hanoi has subscribed.</p>
                    <p>e. For years Hanoi has followed a deliberate policy of using assassination
                        and other forms of terrorism against civilians in its attempt to deprive the
                        South Vietnamese people of their independence. This policy is abhorrent to
                        the United States. Accusations of isolated instances of atrocities by
                        Americans have created grave concern in our nation, beginning at the highest
                        levels, and the individuals involved are brought to trial. Americans
                        withhold judgment of the accused, however, until a verdict is returned
                        indicating guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This is in accord with the Code
                        of Military Justice and the U.S. legal system, under which the individual is
                        presumed innocent until found guilty.</p>
                    <p>f. The United States stands for freedom of choice for the people of South
                        Viet-Nam. In most parts of the nation—in those not controlled <pb
                            facs="0189" n="137" xml:id="pg_137"/> by the National Liberation
                        Front—local government officials have been elected to office in free
                        elections. National leaders, including the President, Vice President and
                        members of both houses of the National Assembly, were chosen by the people.
                        The <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss>, on the other hand, has never put
                        its claim of legitimacy to the test of the ballot box.</p>
                    <p>g. The path to peace is a two-way street. The President has set forth the
                        record of U.S. good faith in the quest for a negotiated settlement. Hanoi
                        has offered nothing in return. Despite the discouraging lack of progress in
                        efforts to negotiate, the U.S. will continue to do everything possible and
                        consider any proposal that might advance this means of bringing the conflict
                        to an end.</p>
                    <p>h. In continuing the reduction of our troop commitment (by 115,000 this year)
                        the President has clearly shown the U.S. determination to end the conflict
                        and to take risks for peace.</p>
                    <p>5. Agency media will continue to give a balanced presentation of support for
                        U.S. policy and of dissent in United States, as well as divergent viewpoints
                        and interpretations.</p>
                    <p>6. In sum, the United States will continue along complementary tracks of its
                        clearly-defined path, rejecting a precipitate, immediate withdrawal from
                        Viet-Nam. The U.S. Government has made clear its confidence that these
                        tracks—negotiation preferably, Vietnamization as necessary—will lead to a
                        peace that will preserve the fundamental right of the people of South
                        Viet-Nam to determine their own future.</p>

                            subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations: “This was a
                            1-hour program, with <gloss target="#t_CBS_1">CBS</gloss> sending over a
                            group of cameramen and people headed by Charles Collingwood. They spent
                            6 weeks in Vietnam. They came up with a documentary called ‘Timetable
                            for Vietnam’ which in my judgment was very forceful in presenting the
                            American position in Vietnam and the validity of it. It had a very high
                            credibility factor because it was not made by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                                >USIA</gloss>.” He continued: “Normally a documentary of that sort

                            throughout the world. In this case they gave us the direct projection

                        makes clear, the Agency attaches particular importance to this film. May I
                        ask you please to give it your personal attention.</p>
                    <p>A number of you have noted in the past that Viet-Nam was not a lively issue
                        in your country, and that for <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> to do
                        much programming on the subject was only to risk focusing attention on it
                        where now there was little or none, possibly with unfavorable results as far
                        as attitudes toward the U.S. were concerned. If this is still your judgment
                        of the situation, you may choose not to program this film, or at any rate to
                        program it only to a very limited degree.</p>
                    <p>But I would like to be very sure that you are sure of this—you, your
                        Ambassador and other members of the Country Team. My own impression, I must
                        say, is that Viet-Nam is on people’s minds almost everywhere these days,
                        with the U.S. role not widely understood or respected, to put it mildly, and
                        that effective programming by <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                        <pb facs="0191" n="139" xml:id="pg_139"/> to correct misimpressions is
                        therefore very much needed almost everywhere.<note n="5" xml:id="d64fn5">An
                            unknown hand underlined this sentence.</note></p>
                    <p>If effective programming on the topic is indeed called for in your country of
                        assignment, then <hi rend="italic">A Timetable for Viet-Nam</hi> should be
                        useful to you. It strikes us, at any rate, as being an unusually effective
                            <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss>-style report on how South Viet-Nam
                        really is becoming a viable entity politically, socially, economically and
                        militarily, and on how the President’s plans for U.S. military disengagement
                        therefore stands a reasonable chance of success—and not just as a disguised
                        defeat.</p>
                    <p>The report is not in any sense an official briefing. <gloss target="#t_CBS_1"
                            >CBS</gloss> made it, and aired it to the American people, quite
                        independently of any element of the U.S. Government. It is frankly critical
                        of some aspects of the U.S. and South Vietnamese performances. It is not
                        dogmatic; it acknowledges uncertainties, problems, dangers. Its predictions
                        of success are heavily qualified. Its handling of the Viet Cong and North
                        Vietnamese is measured, not shrill. All of this makes its basic points the
                        more persuasive, we find.</p>
                    <p>Would you in due course please give me your evaluation of the usefulness of
                        this film. If there were differences of opinion about it, within the Country
                        Team, what were they? How did you try to program the film, if at all? (Note
                        in the circular that television rights have been obtained for several
                        African <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> posts; <gloss target="#t_CBS_1"
                            >CBS</gloss> withheld these rights only for those countries where it
                        felt it could market the program commercially.) What were the results?—how
                        many showings, where, to what kinds of audiences, with what reactions from
                        them?</p>

                            he has in this memorandum. I think the President has quite clearly, and
                            certainly you have, broadened the Nixon Doctrine beyond the confines of

                    <p>The President, in his memorandum of November 5 calling for proposals for the

                                <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName> outlined what would

                    <p>The President, in his press conference on February 6, 1969, said, “I think
                        you could describe me best as not being a half-worlder with my eyes looking
                        only to Europe or only to Asia, but one who sees the <pb facs="0193" n="141"

                    <p>The impression is rather widely held, however, that Viet-Nam and related
                        Asian issues have preoccupied the Administration and have overshadowed the
                        problems of our relations with other areas. The news media, both American
                        and foreign, by their own concentration on the war, the peace efforts and
                        the demonstrations, have contributed to this view and to obscuring the fact
                        that our new Asian policy is closely related to the policies developed for
                        other areas.</p>
                    <p>Contrary to the misunderstanding of some of the press and public, a close
                        examination reveals that there is an impressive, compelling consistency and
                        logical imperative between the Nixon Doctrine for Asia and the President’s
                        statements of U.S. policy toward Europe, Latin America and Africa. While it
                        has gone largely unnoticed by the press, the underlying principles are the
                        same, the style and approach to be followed are identical, and the
                        long-range objectives for those areas are consistent and mutually
                        supporting.</p>
                    <p>The fact that the President does see the world “whole,” and that he has
                        fashioned a foreign policy to take the U.S. with our friends and allies
                        “forward together in the whole world,” could be dramatically and clearly
                        demonstrated by a Presidential declaration extending the Nixon Doctrine into
                        a major thrust in foreign affairs.</p>
                    <p>A statement by the President to this effect might appropriately include the
                        following principles:</p>
                    <p>1. We recognize that national pride is the dominant factor in nation
                        building, and we affirm our respect for the identity and national dignity of
                        all nations.</p>
                    <p>2. We are dedicated to improving the quality of life, but we recognize that
                        each nation must achieve its own development in terms of its own traditions
                        and values. We stand ready to help where we are asked and where developing
                        nations themselves are moving ahead.</p>
                    <p>3. While “lecturing less and listening more” we will count upon the
                        constructive cooperation of our friends and allies.</p>
                    <p>4. We are prepared to lend support, along with other economically developed
                        nations, to regional organizations or through multilateral arrangements
                        where our support is sought for constructive proposals.</p>
                    <p>5. We recognize the primary responsibilities of other states for their
                        affairs—for development, security and military defense. We shall furnish
                        military and economic assistance when requested and when we find it
                        essential and in accordance with our treaty commitments. <pb facs="0194"
                            n="142" xml:id="pg_142"/> But we shall look to any nation directly
                        concerned or threatened to assume the primary responsibility. “The defense
                        of freedom is everybody’s business—not just Americans’ business. And it is
                        particularly the responsibility of the people whose freedom is
                            threatened.”<note n="5" xml:id="d65fn5"><persName corresp="#p_NP_1"
                                >Nixon</persName> made this statement in his November 3, 1969,

                        45</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>6. Our policies will seek to lessen the dependence of other nations upon us
                        and reduce the need for American support.</p>
                    <p>7. While aid is temporarily necessary, trade is essential in development, and
                        we shall press for a liberal system of tariff preferences to be extended to
                        developing countries. We shall take the lead in international forums in
                        seeking to reduce some of the non-tariff barriers maintained by
                        industrialized countries that affect the opportunities of the developing
                        countries to export their products and also seek Congressional approval of
                        unilateral reductions in our import tariffs on a variety of products of
                        special interest to developing countries.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advantages:</p>
                    <p>A Presidential statement extending the Nixon Doctrine beyond the confines of
                        Asia would, in our opinion, have the following positive results:</p>
                    <p>1. It would show that the U.S. is pursuing a logically integrated, coherent
                        and consistent foreign policy toward the non-Communist countries of the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>2. It would increase the understanding and respect of both Americans and
                        foreigners for our foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>3. It would make clear that we are concerned for the people of all less
                        developed countries, and that we do not favor one at the expense of
                        others.</p>
                    <p>4. It would reassure American citizens and our friends abroad that we seek to
                        avoid future wars like Viet-Nam, but that we are not withdrawing from our
                        role as a major world power into a shell of isolationism.</p>

                            inducement campaign has been a solid success in 1969, producing over
                            47,000 defectors. The ralliers have provided crucial intelligence and
                            other aid to Free World Forces, and these defections are a major concern
                            to the Communist leadership. Yet the inducement campaign to defect,
                            surrender, or desert, while singularly effective against Viet Cong
                            (Southerners), has had little effect against the North Vietnamese Army
                                (<gloss target="#t_NVA_1">NVA</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>The leaflet campaigns along the Lao trail and border areas of Cambodia
                            appear to be very useful. But the Cambodia effort lacks continuity
                            because of recurrent unfavorable wind conditions and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPN_1">Sihanouk</persName>’s prohibition against
                            overflight. Reward programs for delivering enemy weapons have been
                            partially successful. Efforts to play on North-South regional prejudices
                            in enemy ranks have been cautious, subtle and almost exclusively
                            covert.</p>
                        <p>Now that enemy forces are predominantly North Vietnamese, two appeals are
                            becoming stale: (1) the appeal to rally seldom affects North Vietnamese
                            soldiers because their relatives are in the North, not the South; and
                            (2) the appeal to surrender under slackening battle situations is not
                            compelling, as the <gloss target="#t_NVA_1">NVA</gloss> often retreats
                            to sanctuaries. Therefore, it would appear necessary to expand and
                            sharpen communication with Communist forces, particularly <gloss
                                target="#t_NVA_1">NVA</gloss>, in sanctuaries or on the trail, where
                            war-weariness and opportunity for reflection can be exploited.</p>
                        <p>For the past fifteen months, there has been no overt program directed
                            specifically at North Vietnam. This is the largest gap in <gloss

                            PSYOP in Vietnam. The only means of addressing North Vietnamese targets
                            is via radio. The Voice of America (<gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss>) can be heard in <gloss target="#t_NVN_1">NVN</gloss> by
                            very limited but important audiences 10 hours daily, but its message is
                            directed to all Vietnamese, and often in the Southern dialect. We have
                            some indications that information received from <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"

                        <p>An intensive and extensive all-media campaign, based on political,
                            military, economic, and social progress in South Vietnam, continues with
                            growing success to foster mutual support between the <gloss

                        <p>With the above developing situation, 1970 programs should serve three
                            major purposes: (1) weaken the resolve of enemy forces, especially the

                            the North Vietnamese people.</p>
                        <p>Specific suggestions for improving our PSYOP include: (1) in inducement
                            programs, increase the proportion of desert/fade-away appeals, (2) in
                            output to <gloss target="#t_NVA_1">NVA</gloss> and <gloss

                            honorable terms, (3) expand air-drops over Cambodia, (4) increase
                            air-drops over Laos, and (5) start overt broadcasts specifically to

                            plethora of <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> PSYOP agencies, and
                            lack of coordination, (4) the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>’s
                            difficulty in training and retaining qualified personnel, (5) possible
                            misuse of information personnel for President Thieu’s personal benefit,
                            (6) the scarcity of official printing establishments, (7) poor

                            offices, and (8) potential neglect of PSYOP against the enemy, owing to

                                youth and asserted: “In this spirit I hope to lead a receptive and
                                open establishment where men speak their minds and are listened to
                                on merit, and where divergent views are fully and promptly passed on
                                for decision. We must tap all the creative ideas and energies of
                                this Department in the formulation of a foreign policy responsive to
                                the needs of the future. Only if we do so can we systematically
                                delineate meaningful alternatives from which the President can
                                determine a considered policy course.</p>

                                Assistant Secretaries, and our Ambassadors—I look not only for your
                                judgment but for stimulation of such a process and in particular
                                your encouragement of the participation of our young people.”
                                (Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, February 10,
                                1969, p. 125)</p></note> I made upon assuming my duties in the
                        Department was that we must encourage the active participation of young
                        people and listen to the ideas of dissenters if we are to formulate a
                        foreign policy responsive to the needs of the future.</p>
                    <p>That statement was addressed to our own people in the Department, but I
                        believe we must take a comparable interest in youth abroad, who today
                        represent a force in society of substantial proportions that may well affect
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> foreign relations of the future.</p>
                    <p>We must take them into account—just as we do more traditional political,
                        economic and social forces—in particular because they are increasingly the
                        force of change that will alter the political and social climate in which we
                        work in the future.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, I would like your Country Team to re-examine the attention they
                        are giving to this aspect of their work in order to assure that your
                        Embassy’s efforts are commensurate with the current and potential impact of
                        youth on the society of the country and with the resources available to
                        you.</p>
                    <p>There are two principal objectives on which we should concentrate:</p>
                    <pb facs="0199" n="147" xml:id="pg_147"/>
                    <p>(1) To assure that we assess as accurately as possible the political and
                        social attitudes of students and other young people and come to a sound
                        appreciation of their likely effect on political and social structures. Such
                        analysis should be of immediate value to the Embassies in their own work and
                        will be useful to the Department in both current and long-range
                        planning.</p>
                    <p>(2) To seek to identify and establish relationships with the rising young
                        leaders who are most likely in future years to reach positions of national
                        influence, particularly in economic and political fields. Within carefully
                        but boldly determined limits suitable to your country situation this should
                        include contact not only with potential future leaders within the
                        established system but also with those among the disaffected and the
                        “outs”.</p>
                    <p>I am conscious that recent personnel cuts<note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3"

                            reduce overseas personnel. A July 9, 1969, White House press release
                            indicated that <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName> had ordered
                            a 10 percent reduction in direct-hire personnel and certain military
                            personnel and that the reductions would begin as soon as possible. For

                                >Kissinger</persName> referenced the reduction, noting: “Each agency
                            with personnel overseas will be required to meet the ten per cent quota,
                            and reductions will be made on a country-by-country basis, insofar as
                            practicable.” The memorandum is printed in <ref

                        workloads difficult and that you face hard decisions in determining where to
                        place your priorities. It is the intention of this instruction that
                        Embassies should reassess youth matters to assure that they are being given
                        their proper attention proportional to the increased world-wide impact of
                        youth. While reducing wherever possible the total flow of communications, it
                        is necessary to bear in mind that the phenomenon of politically conscious
                        and restless youth should be routinely built in as part of your mission’s
                        normal political reporting.</p>
                    <p>The following specific suggestions have worked in some countries to assure
                        adequate attention to youth matters. Obviously the situation varies from
                        country to country, and the organization of the work must be adapted to the
                        size and resources of your Mission.</p>
                    <p>1. While all officers should be responsible for contacts with and reporting
                        views of youth in their functional areas of responsibility, you may wish to
                        consider the designation of a special youth officer from among the present
                        complement. Such an officer, regardless of his agency affiliation, should
                        work with and through the political section in his capacity as coordinator
                        and stimulator of Mission youth awareness and contact. He should be of an
                        age and personality that suit <pb facs="0200" n="148" xml:id="pg_148"/> him
                        to deal with young people and to develop the intense personal relationships
                        that characterize this work. The goal should be to find, assign and support
                        the best qualified person in a manner that will be appropriate and
                        comfortable for your Mission.</p>
                    <p>The responsibilities of such an officer would include:</p>
                    <p>(a) Establishing contacts, and coordinating the effort of others to do the
                        same, with influential young leaders (political, labor, business, student,
                        educational, media, military, governmental, etc.).</p>
                    <p>(b) Encouraging, initiating and coordinating analysis and reporting on
                        current and potential political, social and economic impact of youth forces
                        on society. One early focus of such reporting could usefully be the plans of
                        youth groups and the local government for participation in the U.N.
                        sponsored World Youth Assembly to be held in New York in July, 1970.</p>
                    <p>(c) Coordinating other Embassy efforts on a day-to-day basis.</p>
                    <p>A reasonable percentage of representation and travel funds will be needed for
                        his use.</p>
                    <p>2. The established Youth Committees, chaired by you or a senior Embassy
                        officer, should continue to have responsibility for overall direction of
                        youth matters among all elements of the Mission. Alternatively, such
                        supervision and coordination might appropriately be subject to direct
                        responsibility of your Country Team.</p>
                    <p>3. You are requested to review with your Country Team whether some resources
                        could be specifically earmarked for youth matters. In addition to
                        representation and travel funds, these may include <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> GOE funds, and grants to binational centers; <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> exchange grants; military training
                        opportunities; and, where <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> operates,
                        participant training slots and the use of the Special Development
                        (self-help) Fund in support of development projects with youth
                        involvement.</p>
                    <p>Support and overall supervision of the youth program will continue to be
                        extended from Washington by the Inter-Agency Youth Committee (State,
                        Defense, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                            >AID</gloss>), chaired by the Counselor of the Department and supported
                        full time by the Department’s Youth Advisor.</p>
                    <p>I would appreciate your consideration of the guidance in this <gloss
                            target="#t_CA_1">CA</gloss> and would welcome your comments. Your
                        personal interest and conclusions will, I am sure, be the key to the
                        effectiveness of your Mission’s program.</p>

                    <p>In talking to several people in Philadelphia<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2">The
                            evening of January 24, the President and the First Lady traveled to
                            Philadelphia by train in order to attend a concert of the Philadelphia
                            Orchestra at the Philadelphia Academy of Music. That evening, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName> also presented the Presidential
                            Medal of Freedom to violinist Eugene Ormandy, the Music Director of the
                            Philadelphia Orchestra. (Ibid., Nixon Presidential Materials, White
                            House Central Files, President’s Daily Diary) For the text of the
                            President’s remarks upon presenting the award, see <hi rend="italic"

                        to the <persName corresp="#p_HN_1">Nancy Hanks</persName>-<persName
                            corresp="#p_GL_1">Garment</persName> operation<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d68fn3">Presumable reference to the efforts undertaken by the
                            International Cultural Strategy Group regarding the promulgation of a
                            national cultural policy. See <ref target="#d38">Documents 38</ref> and
                                <ref target="#d42">42</ref>.</note> on the ground that their thrust
                        was to support those activities in the cultural field which were “novel” and
                        broke new ground rather than to put any significant emphasis on the more
                        traditional activities.</p>
                    <p>This is completely contrary to my views. I do not want to take it up directly
                        with <persName corresp="#p_GL_1">Garment</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_HN_1">Hanks</persName> but I want you to. As you, of course,
                        know those who are on the modern art and music kick are 95 percent against
                        us anyway. I refer to the recent addicts of <persName corresp="#p_BL_1"
                            >Leonard Bernstein</persName> and the whole New York crowd.</p>
                    <p>When I compare the horrible monstrosity of Lincoln Center with the Academy of
                        Music in Philadelphia I realize how decadent the modern art and architecture
                        have become.</p>
                    <p>This is what the <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>-<persName
                            corresp="#p_SRS_1">Shriver</persName> crowd believed in and they had
                        every right to encourage this kind of stuff when they were in. But I have no
                        intention whatever of continuing to encourage it now. If this forces a
                        show-down and even some resignations it’s all right with me. I am not going
                        to have 40 million dollars scattered all over the country in projects of
                        this type.</p>
                    <p>P.S. I also want a check made with regard to the incredibly atrocious modern
                        art that has been scattered around the embassies around the world. I asked
                        for this several months ago from <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1"
                            >Shakespeare</persName> and have heard nothing but silence since I made
                        the request. I know that <persName corresp="#p_KKB_1">Keating</persName> has
                        done some cleaning out of the Embassy in New Delhi, but I want to know what
                        they are doing in some of the other places. One of the worst, incidentally,
                        was <persName corresp="#p_DRH_1">Davis</persName> in Rumania.</p>
                    <pb facs="0202" n="150" xml:id="pg_150"/>
                    <p>We, of course, cannot tell the Ambassadors what kind of art they personally
                        can have, but I found in travelling around the world that many of our
                        Ambassadors were displaying the modern art due to the fact that they were
                        compelled to because of some committee which once was headed up by Mrs.
                            Kefauver<note n="4" xml:id="d68fn4">Reference is to Nancy Kefauver, the
                            wife of Senator Estes Kefauver (D-Tennessee), the 1956 Democratic
                            nominee for Vice President. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> had appointed Mrs. Kefauver Director of the Art
                            in Embassies Program.</note> and where they were loaned some of these
                        little uglies from the Museum of Modern Art in New York. At least, I want a
                        quiet check made—not one that is going to hit the newspapers and stir up all
                        the troops—but I simply want it understood that this Administration is going
                        to turn away from the policy of forcing our embassies abroad or those who
                        receive assistance from the United States at home to move in the direction
                        of off-beat art, music and literature.</p>

                        aspect of the Bicentennial should be made before the spring meeting of the

                        <p>I. Participation: Almost 60 countries already seem interested in
                                participating.<note n="5" xml:id="d69fn5">See footnote, page 3.
                                [Footnote is in the original. The footnote on page 3 reads: “*<hi
                                    rend="italic">Foreign Policy Footnote</hi> There is undoubtedly
                                some correlation between the interest of many foreign governments in
                                participating in a 1976 Bicentennial exposition (I) and the reason
                                most frequently given for such participation—the promotion of trade,
                                tourism and investment abroad (IV). This suggests that the role of
                                foreign governments (and international organizations) at even the
                                non-commercial type of exposition sponsored by the <gloss

                        <p>II. If approved by the Bureau of International Expositions (<gloss

                            received the following comment:</p>
                        <p>A. National pavilion: Only about 15 countries, mostly <gloss
                                target="#t_BIE_1">BIE</gloss> member nations, now seem to have the

                        <pb facs="0204" n="152" xml:id="pg_152"/>
                        <p>B. National exhibit: The use of covered space to mount an exhibit is
                            favored by about 30 smaller nations.</p>
                        <p>C. Joint exhibit: This alternative is almost equally favored by a group
                            of Scandinavian, Central American, various African regional and S.E.
                            Asian countries.</p>
                        <p>D. Performing arts: There is a wide indication of interest. However, U.S.
                            funding would be required in a number of cases.</p>
                        <p>E. Special Demonstration project: Only a half-dozen countries now show a
                            capacity to contribute in this manner (Canada, Iceland, Scandinavia,
                            Israel, Libya, India). Funds are definitely a factor.</p>
                        <p>F. People-to-people: Same as II(d).</p>
                        <p>III. Foreign response if the event is organized outside of <gloss
                                target="#t_BIE_1">BIE</gloss> jurisdiction? <gloss target="#t_BIE_1"
                                >BIE</gloss> approval is not a critical factor to many of the

                                target="#t_BIE_1">BIE</gloss>. Also, lack of <gloss
                                target="#t_BIE_1">BIE</gloss> sanction might bring participation by
                            non-member nations at minimum levels. On the other hand, if the
                            celebration were negotiated as a project beyond <gloss target="#t_BIE_1"
                                >BIE</gloss> jurisdiction, there should probably be no restraint to
                            participation even by <gloss target="#t_BIE_1">BIE</gloss> member
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>A. Special demonstration project:</p>
                        <p>B. Cultural/artistic program:</p>
                        <p>C. People-to-people:</p>
                        <p>The response is generally similar to that given under II (d, e, &amp;
                            f.)</p>
                        <p>IV. Determining factors in participation: The most-frequently noted
                            incentive to participation is promotion of trade, tourism and
                            investment. Also cited are prestige, displays of amity and friendship,
                            and a concern for the state of political relations with the U.S. during
                            the next 5 years.<note n="6" xml:id="d69fn6">Ibid.</note></p>
                        <p>V. Importance of site: In almost all, except special interest cases, the
                            particular metropolitan site is not considered a factor that would
                            seriously affect participation. Apparently this reflects some confidence
                            in the site-selection process being undertaken by the U.S.
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>A. Competition between cities: The reaction to a competition between
                            cities was generally negative.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is the undated, 9-page table entitled “U.S. 1976
                            Bicentennial Exposition.”]</p>
                        <pb facs="0205" n="153" xml:id="pg_153"/>
                        <p>B. Multi-site possibilities: Most foreign countries regard the multi-city
                            concept with misgiving. They believe multi-city proposals will result in
                            an increase in administrative/financial burdens, rivalry between sites
                            and a diffusion in total impact. They will probably respond favorably to
                            a multi-site-in-one-city location if they are provided the necessary,
                            organizational assurances by the expo management.</p>

                    <p>As the Secretary informed the President on January 22, negotiations for
                        renewal of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> Exchanges Agreement began January 29.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d70fn2">Reference is to the “Agreement Between the United States
                            of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on Exchanges in
                            the Scientific, Technical, Educational, Cultural and Other Fields in
                            1970–1971.” In a January 22 memorandum to the President, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> indicated that the negotiations
                            on the agreement would take place in Washington beginning January 29 and
                            that the United States and Soviet Union had exchanged draft texts. After
                            noting several significant differences in the drafts, concerning
                            exhibits, educational exchanges, and scientific and technical exchanges,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> stated: “Indications
                            are that the negotiations will be carried on in an atmosphere notably
                            better than on some occasions in the past. Specifically, earlier Soviet
                            references to Viet-Nam or other political issues as a hindrance to
                            fruitful exchanges are not likely to be repeated. Given a suitable
                            atmosphere, we intend to encourage the Soviets to look toward new
                            activities, such as cooperative research, which will deepen the exposure
                            of their people to American society.” (Ibid.) Additional documentation
                            on the negotiations is ibid.</note></p>
                    <p>By now, most provisions have been agreed satisfactorily. This includes
                        restoration of normal levels in educational and performing arts exchanges;
                        introduction of the category “Man and His Environment” and of a new
                        provision for exchanges of lecturers; and continuation of all other
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have, however, informed us today that they are prepared to reach
                        agreement on the important exhibit exchange only if we meet two points which
                        they have raised. Specifically, they will <pb facs="0206" n="154"
                            xml:id="pg_154"/> accept an exchange of one exhibit in six cities (as
                        before) for up to four weeks in each city (changed from three to four
                        weeks). Based upon our experience under the last agreement, this represents
                        a potential 15% increase in exposure. However, they insist upon our
                        accepting some language in the new agreement dealing with (1) jubilee
                        celebrations and (2) diploma equivalency. The latter can most likely be
                        dealt with by language which is harmless. The former, which is undoubtedly
                        related to Soviet commemoration this year of the Lenin centenary, is
                        probably important to the Soviets for two reasons. First, they fear that we
                        might take actions critical of the Lenin celebration. Second, they may hope
                        that an agreement provision would prove useful in their efforts to drum up
                        support for commemorations outside the communist world.</p>
                    <p>We have already told the Soviets that we, as a government, have no means or
                        intention to inhibit activities related to the Lenin centenary, whether or
                        not the Soviets would regard them as hostile. On the other hand, we have
                        pointed out, we will take no official action which we would regard as
                        hostile or inappropriate. They have, nevertheless, flatly stated that they
                        want some language in the agreement if they are to concede on the exhibit
                        program.</p>
                    <p>We are prepared to offer the following, noncommittal language: “The Parties
                        note that commemorative activities may take place in their countries in
                        connection with jubilee celebrations recognized by international
                        bodies.”</p>
                    <p>Alternatively, we might tell the Soviets that we cannot agree to any language
                        on the subject. Unless they are bluffing, this will suspend the negotiations
                        and we will either face a break or will have to concede the point at a later
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the language which we plan to offer would not likely cause us
                        serious embarrassment under foreseeable circumstances.</p>
                    <p>We will be meeting with the chairman of the Soviet delegation at 11 A.M.

                    <p>Without checking directly with the British, it is, of course, not possible to
                        give a precise prediction of possible British participation in the 1976
                        Exposition. This participation would also naturally depend very much on the
                        form, content and approach which is finally determined by our own national
                        commission. Within these limitations, the following comments can be
                        made:</p>
                    <p>1. In view of the “special relationship,” at least in the cultural field, as
                        well as of Britain’s somewhat special role in the origins of American
                        independence, we believe Britain would have no choice but to be present in a
                        major way in any form of celebration of our bicentennial.</p>
                    <p>2. As Britain has consistently played a major role in the <gloss
                            target="#t_BIE_1">BIE</gloss>, they will certainly wish to have any
                        participation of an exposition nature be in a <gloss target="#t_BIE_1"
                            >BIE</gloss>-sanctioned event. At the same time, for the reasons above,
                        they would have a difficult time not participating on strictly <gloss
                            target="#t_BIE_1">BIE</gloss> grounds, and in the event of a non-<gloss
                            target="#t_BIE_1">BIE</gloss> sanctioned event would probably try hard
                        to find a way out of the dilemma. In order to avoid the dilemma, however,
                        the chances are that they will give their support in the <gloss
                            target="#t_BIE_1">BIE</gloss> to any proposals the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> may make provided that we on our side are
                        willing to abide by the essential rules.</p>
                    <p>3. In order to improve the British image in this connection, we assume that
                        (financial considerations allowing) the British would prefer to have a
                        national-type pavilion in any exposition if national pavilions were allowed.
                        If pavilions of a “subject” nature were the rule, we assume that the British
                        would want to have a clearly identified and significant role in them.</p>
                    <p>4. The site or sites selected are unlikely to have any effect on British
                        participation, though they might perhaps prefer a site not too closely
                        associated with a major British defeat (e.g. Yorktown).<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d71fn3">Lord Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown, October 19,
                            1781.</note></p>
                    <pb facs="0208" n="156" xml:id="pg_156"/>
                    <p>5. It is quite possible that the scale of British participation might be
                        enhanced if there were a chance of maintaining some sort of permanent
                        exposition which would contribute in a lasting way to <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>
                        relations. On the other hand, cost factors might militate against this.</p>
                    <p>6. Recognizing that <gloss target="#t_BIE_1">BIE</gloss> rules forbid
                        commercial exhibits, it is nevertheless important to realize that the scale
                        of British participation would be enhanced if they could associate it in
                        some way with the promotion of British exports, which is a major national
                        objective.</p>
                    <p>7. The United Kingdom already has a good system of performing arts in the
                        U.S. It is anticipated that this would be expanded to take advantage of the
                        facilities offered at an exhibition for the display of British skills, arts,
                        and culture.</p>

                    <p>Apparently you impressed <persName corresp="#p_DK_1">Kirk Douglas</persName>
                        very much and also whetted his appetite for a more active role in our
                        information efforts. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HSB_1"
                            >Herschensohn</persName> proposes the establishment of a committee
                        consisting of Hollywood talent, Motion Picture Association of America and
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, with a view to exploiting
                        entertaining personalities already travelling abroad, with <gloss

                        politically, recognizing that the temperament of our players would require
                        some careful and deft handling.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>

                            but he wants to do something for the country and feels he can do this
                            kind of work well.<note n="8" xml:id="d72fn8">In a March 6 memorandum to

                                    rend="italic">per se</hi>. He likes to project ‘a picture of
                                himself as a poor boy who had made good and had kept a sense of
                                proportion and faith in American society and institutions.’ It is
                                also clear, however, that it is as a Hollywood film star that he has
                                interest for overseas audiences and any programming would have to
                                start from that premise. He has been effective in meeting with
                                university students. He appears able to talk on such subjects as
                                ‘The role of the arts in a democracy,’ ‘The performing artist in a
                                modern society,’ ‘Is the cinema dead?’ He also is not adverse,
                                apparently, to discussing civil rights, war and peace and other
                                subjects in a political vein.” (National Archives, <gloss

                            advantage of a national asset. The obvious danger is, what happens when
                            these celebrities speak against present policy? Practically <pb
                                facs="0211" n="159" xml:id="pg_159"/> all the actors and actresses
                            he mentioned and can summon are people who not only represent the
                            liberal persuasion and are politically partisan but they are highly
                            outspoken. (Paul Newman, Burt Lancaster, Marlon Brando were some of the
                            names.)</p>
                        <p>In the course of our conversation he said if anyone in an audience asked
                            him he would say, “I didn’t vote for <persName corresp="#p_NP_1"
                                >Nixon</persName>, but frankly I think he’s doing a damned good
                            job”. He, obviously, is one who gets involved at election time as a
                            partisan but is non-partisan after the election and I feel he could be a
                            real asset. I’m not so sure of some of the other names mentioned (not so
                            much in regard to the President, but in regard to present policies).</p>
                        <p>At any rate, I feel a sensible plan could and <hi rend="italic"
                                >should</hi> be worked out and may have many benefits.</p>
                        <p>First, he’s right. So many of these people <hi rend="italic">want</hi> to
                            do something for their country, and almost feel a frustration at not
                            being asked. Most are too proud to ask if they can be useful. Secondly,
                            they do draw crowds and we could be in the act just enough to enlarge or
                            limit future engagements, depending on how they conduct their
                            engagements and how they respond to questions. We could also be out of
                            the act enough to make it a non-government representation. If they were
                            good (and certainly some would be good), it could be some of the best
                            people-to-people contact.</p>
                        <p>There is another benefit: It is often said (because it’s true), that the
                            Hollywood artistic community is largely liberally oriented and from the
                            Democratic party. <persName corresp="#p_DK_1">Kirk Douglas</persName>
                            met <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName> and now he
                            raves about him. In short, he found out Republicans are also humans and
                            perhaps Washington should discover Hollywood personalities are also
                            humans. To my knowledge, no President since <gloss target="#t_FDR_1"
                                >FDR</gloss> has recognized Hollywood’s contributions to the point
                            of <hi rend="italic">requesting</hi> their contributions. That’s the
                            highest honor. Perhaps President <persName corresp="#p_NP_1"
                                >Nixon</persName> could set up a committee for the purpose of doing
                            exactly that. He would be recognizing the unique position of the
                            American film industry—an industry of <hi rend="italic">artists</hi> who
                            have created a major twentieth century art form. He would also show he
                            realizes they can tell the world about the creative spirit in America
                            perhaps better than a government official. The Hollywood community would
                            be flattered beyond comparison with any other Presidential
                            directive.</p>
                        <p>The following is a preliminary plan only for the purpose of
                            discussion:</p>
                        <p>The President appoints a committee to take national advantage of the
                            resource of already travelling Hollywood artists. The committee consists
                            of Hollywood talent, <gloss target="#t_MPAA_1">MPAA</gloss>, and <gloss
                                target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> (or State/<gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                                >CU</gloss>). The committee meets quarterly and acts as a clearing
                            house to assimilate what personalities will be where in the next three
                            months, and who <pb facs="0212" n="160" xml:id="pg_160"/> would be
                            interested in talking to specific groups. The <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                                >USIA</gloss> representative would then advise the appropriate
                                <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s in those countries where the
                            celebrities will be visiting.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> arranges for whatever we
                            request. (Perhaps a meeting with university students on a particular
                            topic or a creative group on another topic or whatever.) <gloss
                                target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Washington would serve as the
                            catalyst, the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s as planners. If we
                            find out that celebrity #7 is counter-productive to the foreign policy
                            aims of the country, we take his name off the list for future
                            engagements.</p>
                        <p>Would we act as censor? Not really. Certainly not regarding what they
                            say. We <hi rend="italic">would</hi> set-up where they speak and to whom
                            they speak. We would also advise the committee of our recommendations
                            based on past performances.</p>
                        <p>Though the cinema is now a world-wide art, America is its inventor and
                            retains a monopoly of real talent.</p>
                        <p>I think this plan, or something like it, is something the government
                            should initiate during this Administration.</p>
                        <p>We all know there is a real two party system emerging in the South.
                            Beyond this plan’s more obvious immediate merits, maybe we can help
                            create a two party system in Hollywood.</p>

                    <p>The idea that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> programs address
                        themselves principally to <hi rend="italic">intellectual</hi> elites is
                        mistaken. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> does attempt to focus,
                        however, on bringing its message to present and potential leaders in a given
                        country. This policy has been reinforced by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>’s attempt to rationalize its operations through a
                        planning-programming-budgeting system which requires that program
                        effectiveness be judged principally by the exposure of well defined target
                        groups to <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> program output. The target
                        group approach to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> programs is
                        implemented world-wide. In a few countries, however, mass audiences are
                        considered important target groups. Examples are Vietnam and Thailand where
                        the threat of actual and potential insurgencies makes mass opinion
                        critical.</p>
                    <p>It is doubtful that world-wide <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        activities could be reoriented toward mass audiences without an appreciable
                        increase in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s budget. Neither is it
                        clear that such a reorientation would further U.S. foreign policy goals. On
                        the whole, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s effectiveness depends
                        more <pb facs="0214" n="162" xml:id="pg_162"/> on the quality of its
                        personnel and its message than on whether it pursues a mass or an elitist
                        approach to propaganda. I can request a study clarifying the costs and
                        benefits of a mass audience as opposed to a target group approach.</p>

                    <p>On my last extensive trip to the area, I ran into repeated requests from our
                        posts for a greater input of films to be used both as a representative
                        American art-form and an art-form that has particular appeal to young
                        intellectuals.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that the success of our Experimental Film Program last year
                        speaks for itself. However, at least three of the posts, which had it would
                        like to see it repeated on an annual basis (with different films of course).
                        Still other posts, which didn’t get the Experimental Film Package, want
                        something similar.</p>
                    <p>I wonder if <gloss target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss> could explore at least two
                        possibilities for <gloss target="#t_IAN_1">IAN</gloss> in the very near
                        future. First, could we ask Willard Van Dyke of the Museum of Modern Art to
                        undertake putting together a selection of <pb facs="0215" n="163"
                            xml:id="pg_163"/> experimental films annually? We might be able to
                        provide a consultant’s fee for this and, of course, we would pay for the
                        prints. If other areas are interested, we could involve ourselves to a
                        bigger project at less cost per area.</p>
                    <p>A second source is suggested by the attached clipping.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d74fn2">Not found attached.</note> Is it possible for us to
                        latch onto the 25 films involved in the National Student Film Festival?<note

                                target="#t_NSA_1">NSA</gloss>).</note> Or is the level of film
                        making involved here less than we would want? If so, is there some way that
                        the American Film Institute could pull together (for a fee) a higher level
                        of experimental films?</p>
                    <p>Obviously, all of our posts would also welcome contemporary Hollywood film
                        classics on a continuing basis, even more than they get now, but I quite
                        understand the problems involved. That’s one of the reasons we’d like you to
                        explore for us relatively inexpensive sources of the film productions of the
                        better young film makers in the United States. I cannot emphasize for you
                        sufficiently the appeal such films have for our target audiences. It’s
                        something of a phenomenon which we must put to our use.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Seventh Annual Report of the U.S. Advisory Commission on
                        International Educational and Cultural Affairs</p>
                    <p>One who surveys international educational and cultural exchange programs
                        cannot but be struck by their enormous variety; and as he comes upon the
                        widely differing activities with their diverse goals, he feels as if he were
                        peering into a kaleidoscope—so ever-changing are the patterns he sees.
                        During the past year the Advisory Commission has itself looked at many of
                        these programs from many points of view and with many counselors both inside
                        and outside the Government. In this our Seventh Annual Report we wish to
                        state some of our findings and conclusions.</p>
                    <p>In May of 1969 the Commission met with representatives of various outside
                        organizations and other Government advisory groups to discuss the whole
                        range of the Government’s educational and cultural exchange programs, how
                        these are related to programs of information and propaganda, and a number of
                        other pertinent questions with which we have concerned ourselves. There were
                        present at this meeting representatives from the National Association for
                        Foreign Student Affairs (<gloss target="#t_NAFSA_1">NAFSA</gloss>), the
                        National Council for Community Services to International Visitors (COSERV),
                        the Commission on International Education of the American Council on
                        Education, the National Review Board of the East-West Center in Honolulu,
                        the Government Advisory Committee on International Book and Library
                        Programs, the U.S. Advisory Commission on Information, the Board of Foreign
                        Scholarships, the <pb facs="0217" n="165" xml:id="pg_165"/> Committee on
                        Youth in the office of the Under Secretary of State, and this Advisory
                        Commission itself. Also present at this meeting was <persName
                            corresp="#p_RJ_1">John Richardson</persName>, Jr., the newly designated
                        Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs, whose
                        appointment at that time had not yet been confirmed by the Senate.</p>
                    <p>Then on September 12, 1969, the Advisory Commission held another meeting,
                        this one with the full Board of Foreign Scholarships and the Commission on
                        International Education of the American Council on Education.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d75fn2">A list of participants is included in appendix A.
                            [Footnote is in the original.]</note> Again, our objective in holding
                        these joint meetings was perfectly simple: to get the best possible advice
                        and guidance from the three groups concerning the whole range of
                        international educational and cultural affairs, both public and private. We
                        had written a strong and critical Sixth Annual Report,<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d75fn3">See <ref target="#d3">Document 3</ref>.</note> making a
                        number of significant recommendations, one of which was that all possible
                        effort be made to remove international educational and cultural programs
                        from the Department of State and to combine these with certain educational
                        and cultural portions of the U.S. Information Agency programs and with the
                        programs of the Institute of International Studies in the Department of
                        Health, Education, and Welfare. Obviously, we had offered such
                        recommendations for the most serious consideration of the new
                        Administration, which was one day old when we submitted the report to the
                        Congress and to the President and the Secretary of State.</p>
                    <p>We are pleased to note that in our joint meetings there was thoughtful
                        deliberation of the variety of ways in which these programs might be
                        arranged. There were discussions, for example, of moving all of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> back to the Department of State; of
                        creating a quasi-public corporation, perhaps along the lines of the
                        Smithsonian Institution or the National Academy of Sciences; and of simply
                        removing the cultural affairs officers from the direct control of the U.S.
                        Information Service overseas and creating a career service for these persons
                        within the Department of State and/or the Foreign Service.</p>
                    <p>During the course of the summer and early fall, after Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_REL_1">Richardson</persName>’s confirmation and at
                        subsequent meetings with him, we were pleased to note that both the
                        Assistant Secretary and Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                            >Rogers</persName> obviously intended to give more personal attention to
                        the Department’s international education and cultural programs and to seek
                        for them as much financial support as they thought Congress would permit.
                        Further, it was the view of the Secretary that these programs could best be
                        administered within the Department of State.</p>
                    <pb facs="0218" n="166" xml:id="pg_166"/>
                    <p>One manifestation of the increased support within the Department, the lack of
                        which we had deplored in previous reports, is seen in the fiscal year 1971
                        budget request which is now before the Congress, asking that funds for
                        educational and cultural exchanges be lifted from the $31.425 million, where
                        they now have stood for 2 years, to $40 million.<note n="4" xml:id="d75fn4"
                            >Reference is to <gloss target="#t_HR_1">H.R.</gloss> 17575, the
                            Departments of State, Justice, and Commerce, the Judiciary, and Related
                            Agencies Appropriation Bill for fiscal year 1971.</note> This may not be
                        as much as we would wish, but it amounts to about a one-third increase in
                        the request and, if granted by the Congress, will certainly put the
                        international educational and cultural programs of this Government on the
                        upswing.</p>
                    <p>In the light of the deliberations in the joint meetings mentioned above and
                        the subsequent discussions with Assistant Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_REL_1">Richardson</persName> and with the Secretary himself,
                        the Commission has decided that it will not now press for its earlier
                        recommendation that the programs be removed from the State Department. In
                        all fairness to the new Administration, and with much evidence of increasing
                        support, we have informed the Department of State through the Assistant
                        Secretary that we will watch to see what happens during the next year. If
                        the programs do not receive the support we think they merit, we may then
                        suggest again that they be reordered somehow in the complex of Government
                        organizations concerned with them, or that they be removed from Government
                        and placed in a quasi-public agency.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>, in testimony before
                        the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on September 25, 1969, requesting a
                        restoration in funds cut by the House from the Department’s fiscal year 1970
                        request for $35.4 million for educational and cultural programs, said:</p>
                    <quote><p>“We not only think that this restoration is fully justified, but we
                            would expect in any subsequent years to increase our budget request. I
                            am convinced from observations I have made that in the educational field
                            the money is very well spent. This story repeats itself many times when
                            you talk to young people particularly around the world; how many of them
                            were educated here; how much it has meant to them; and how helpful they
                            will be to the United States in their own countries.”<note n="5"

                    <p>Moreover, we were impressed by the justification used in the Department’s
                        budget presentation for fiscal 1971 requesting $40 million for mutual
                        educational and cultural exchange activities. It seems to us that this is
                        one of the best and most succinct statements we have read <pb facs="0219"
                            n="167" xml:id="pg_167"/> concerning the purposes of the Department’s
                        educational and cultural exchange programs.</p>
                    <quote><p>“Any sound strategy for effective response to the realities we face in
                            world politics requires an improved U.S. capacity to communicate with
                            other societies in the U.S. interest through mutually rewarding
                            interactions among key leadership groups and individuals here and
                            abroad. People-to-people programs of all kinds are therefore a realistic
                            and effective means of enhancing constructive U.S. influence in the
                            world. They can, if well managed, develop a sufficiently common
                            perspective among key elements of other societies and our own to provide
                            a solid base for strengthened economic, military and political, as well
                            as cultural, relations.</p>
                        <p>“The management of such programs, along with the performance of the other
                            policy and coordinating functions of the Secretary of State described
                            above, are the business of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural
                            Affairs.</p>
                        <p>“In discharging these responsibilities, the Bureau operates on the
                            premise that increasing mass media control over the attention and
                            short-term reactions of public opinion does not reduce the influence of
                            individual opinion and decision-makers in the international arena any
                            more than is the case in domestic affairs. And the face-to-face personal
                            experiences those leaders have had with Americans and in America can be
                            crucial for our relations with their countries.</p>
                        <p>“Similarly, mass tourism and the increasing volume of general academic,
                            professional, performing arts and business travel does not at all reduce
                            the significance of the specific positive or negative experiences of the
                            individuals whose attitudes are or will become decisive in each country.
                            Their personal experiences can result in trends and patterns of
                            educational, creative, scientific and political thought leading directly
                            either toward cooperation or conflict. Close and persisting personal,
                            group and institutional relationships can be especially potent factors
                            affecting these trends and patterns when they develop in fields of
                            central social and (ultimately) political importance. Among these fields
                            in most countries are education, science, journalism, public service,
                            the professions and the arts.”</p></quote>

                    <p>It was the Commission’s feeling that the new program initiatives suggested at
                        the joint meeting in September should be formulated by the Assistant
                        Secretary’s office, and he has agreed to undertake this task.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Research and Evaluation</p>
                    <p>In last year’s report we made some fairly strong recommendations with respect
                        to the research and evaluation function in the Bureau of Educational and
                        Cultural Affairs. We were therefore pleased to learn that one of the very
                        first official acts of the new Assistant Secretary was to insert in the then
                        virtually complete fiscal 1971 budget a request to the Congress for the sum
                        of $100,000 for program research and evaluation. It is the Commission’s and
                        the Bureau’s good fortune that he understands the methods and criteria of
                        this function, and that he is being supported in his request for funds by
                        the Department and the Bureau of the Budget.</p>
                    <p>We regret to note, however, that restrictive personnel policies in the
                        Department have delayed the establishment of a permanent evaluation staff
                        which, incidentally, we recommended last year. Along with the Assistant
                        Secretary, we believe that the development of a social science research
                        capability in the Bureau is a fundamental and urgent management requirement;
                        and we hope the Assistant Secretary will be able to find ways within the
                        personnel ceilings to establish such a staff.</p>
                    <p>Institutionalizing the evaluation and research function, needless to say,
                        would give it the staying power which “contracting out” lacks. It would also
                        provide the technical competence required for monitoring research contracts
                        with independent research firms and centers. Finally, this
                        institutionalizing would provide the daily evaluation and research
                        continuity which operators of the program cannot themselves provide, and it
                        would constantly remind all of us of those inevitable gaps between the goals
                        that we envisage and the results we attain.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>To sum up:</p>
                    <p>(1) After much discussion with “a multitude of counselors,” we have decided
                        that it is reasonable to await the outcome of the 1971 budget presentations
                        and final appropriations for international educational and cultural exchange
                        programs before making any recommendations; and to observe the operation of
                        the program by the Department of State. We are pleased to strike an
                        optimistic note about both of these subjects.</p>
                    <p>(2) We have set an agenda for ourselves for the coming year, as noted, and
                        will of course give our attention to other related matters as they come
                        up.</p>
                    <p>(3) We urge the Department as soon as possible, pending availability of

                    <p>Let me tell you about last Thursday<note n="2" xml:id="d76fn2">February
                            26.</note> morning.</p>
                    <p>I saw one of our films in its interlock stage that told the story of a
                        polluted river in another country and about an observatory in still another
                        country. Cinematically, it should have no trouble at all in competing for
                        theatrical placement in the area of the world for which it was produced.
                        After it was over I asked:</p>
                    <p>“What did this cost?”</p>
                    <p>“$22,000.”</p>
                    <p>“What does it do for us?”</p>
                    <p>“The United States financed the observatory.”</p>
                    <p>“But we didn’t say that in the narrative.”</p>
                    <p>“The Area Officer told us not to say that. You see, the U.S. paid the whole
                        bill. 100%. If many countries gave financial contributions it might have
                        been O.K. to mention, but it was only us.”</p>
                    <p>“You mean we don’t want them to know we financed it?”</p>
                    <p>“Right.”</p>
                    <p>“Well, why do we want to show them the damned observatory?”</p>
                    <p>“It builds pride in themselves and their whole area.”</p>
                    <pb facs="0224" n="172" xml:id="pg_172"/>
                    <p>“Not pride in us?”</p>
                    <p>“Pride in them.”</p>
                    <p>“Gee.”</p>
                    <p>“You see, there is no pride if they think we did it for them.”</p>
                    <p>“How about the first part of the film on the river?”</p>
                    <p>“The whole business of ecology and pollution that can harm fishing is a
                        world-wide problem.”</p>
                    <p>“$22,000?”</p>
                    <p>“$22,000.”</p>
                    <p>“Are there other films planned in the series using the same kind of
                        logic?”</p>
                    <p>“Of course. They are all on nation building and pride. The next one is on
                        housing. It won’t show any U.S. involvement.”</p>
                    <p>“How many of these are scheduled?”</p>
                    <p>“Nine.”</p>
                    <p>“Then that’s $22,000 x 9?”</p>
                    <p>“$198,000.”</p>
                    <p>“Since it is such low key propaganda, would the area at least agree to a
                        screen credit for <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>?”</p>
                    <p>“No. It would look like big brother.”</p>
                    <p>“$198,000?”</p>
                    <p>“$198,000.”</p>
                    <p>I had to leave because I was keeping a <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>
                        waiting in my office. He just returned from the country in which he served
                        and he wanted to talk about our films in that country.</p>
                    <p>He said, “They really love films on art and paintings. We should do more of
                        them.”</p>
                    <p>“What else do you feel we need?”</p>
                    <p>“Can we get some underground films to show them?”</p>
                    <p>“Pardon?”</p>
                    <p>“Some underground films. They would go over well.”</p>
                    <p>“Most of them deal with sex or anti-religion or take an anti-U.S. posture on
                        Vietnam or speak against us regarding race relations. Most of it is pretty
                        bad.”</p>
                    <p>“But some of it would be good. They are interested in underground films.”</p>
                    <p>“But we aren’t a public service. What else do you think we should do?”</p>
                    <p>“They have a lot of problems our films could help solve.”</p>
                    <p>“Is that the criteria you use to show our films?”</p>
                    <pb facs="0225" n="173" xml:id="pg_173"/>
                    <p>“Well, it has to be something of real value to them. We should make more
                        films that could help them in development. The whole under-developed world
                        needs more films on national development. We ought to do more of it.”</p>
                    <p>“I think we have higher priorities.” (I said that knowing I was not
                        completely honest since no one really knows.)</p>
                    <p>“We do?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes.”</p>
                    <p>He didn’t ask but I’m sure he wonders what they could possibly be.</p>
                    <p>Maybe he is right. Maybe they are all right. I don’t think so. The debate
                        continues and I feel it should be resolved.</p>
                    <p>Of course national development and regional cooperation is a U.S. foreign
                        policy objective. But won’t any and all U.S. objectives continue to be
                        suspect if we are not held in respect? I would assume the <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s job is to insure that other nations of
                        the world have respect for this country (a job so far unaccomplished) so our
                        broad national and international goals can be more easily achieved.</p>
                    <p>As someone involved in propaganda for the United States, I find it difficult
                        to get enthused about telling citizens of a foreign land that they have a
                        great observatory and their country is responsible for it and at the same
                        time have it be my job to make sure they don’t find out we financed it.</p>
                    <p>I know this may sound absurd but what would happen if we took all the money
                        we spend trying to build respect for <hi rend="italic">other</hi> countries
                        and put it into projects that would have as their goal, building respect for
                            <hi rend="italic">this</hi> country?</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_Am_1">Am</gloss> I not thinking deeply enough?</p>
                    <p>Have we all thought so deeply that we have lost our purpose?</p>
                    <p>I mention all this about Thursday morning because there is one Thursday
                        morning every week and sometimes more.</p>

                            book selection. (Ibid.)</note> I also had several meetings with

                        are being sent automatically. In the case of a small number of titles about

                        full information. In the case of these “discretionary use” books, I believe
                        the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> would welcome additional

                        the appraisal points out other titles the post should order to balance
                        them). . . .</p>

                    <p>—of inferior quality (including those that might be considered pornographic
                        or in poor taste). . . .</p>

                        with nearly limitless opportunities to explain abroad the direction in which

                    <p>2. Agency media and posts alike should take sustained and creative steps to
                        ensure that the substance of the report is kept before the public in the
                        months to come. For this comprehensive statement on foreign and defense
                        policy sets out a long term strategy for peace—not tactics to meet immediate
                        crises.</p>
                    <p>3. The President’s report reflects the change that has taken place in the
                        pattern of international relationships. It signifies a shift from the
                        policies of the postwar era, an era characterized by American leadership in
                        nearly all fields of endeavor, to the era of the 1970’s, in which other
                        nations have the ability and the responsibility to do for themselves what
                        once we might have been required to do for them. This concept of shared
                        responsibilities is the essence of the Nixon Doctrine.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d78fn3">See <ref target="#d65fn3">footnote 3, Document
                            65</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>4. The central thrust of our message should be that this Administration has
                        charted a new course in American foreign policy predicated on a balanced and
                        realistic American role. America’s interests must shape its commitments,
                        rather than the reverse. Our tone should be one of modesty and restraint, in
                        keeping with the tone of the report. Eschewing ideology, dealing with the
                        world as it is today rather than as it was, or as we might wish it to be,
                        this policy aims at a purposeful partnership with other nations in the
                        pursuit of common ends. We should try to communicate this tone, to get
                        across a sense of new departures.</p>
                    <p>5. At the same time, Agency media and posts alike should take care to show
                        that the U.S. has no intention of withdrawing from the world: we will
                        maintain our commitments, meet our responsibilities, protect our interests,
                        and thereby help to build peace.</p>
                    <p>6. In stressing these goals and their implications for the international
                        community, Agency media and posts should draw upon the following principal
                        themes for emphasis:</p>
                    <p>a. <hi rend="italic">A new era in international relations has begun</hi>. The
                        Nixon administration has taken steps to adjust the interlocking web of its
                        foreign political, economic, trade, and defense policies to the era of the
                        1970’s. This era contrasts sharply with the last two decades. Over that
                        period the energies of a generation of dedicated and creative Americans were
                        absorbed in fashioning policies to deal with a cycle of recurring
                        international crises that had their origins in the destruction caused by
                        World War II and the turmoil and uncertainty that often attended the birth
                        of new nations. Then we confronted a monolithic Communist world and our
                        initiatives and resources were largely responsible for political stability
                        and economic progress. That period is over. Today, we deal with a world of
                        stronger allies, a community of independent developing <pb facs="0230"
                            n="178" xml:id="pg_178"/> nations, and a Communist world still hostile
                        but now divided. These changed circumstances provide opportunity to get at
                        the causes of crises, to take a longer view.</p>
                    <p>b. <hi rend="italic">American foreign policy, designed to help build a
                            durable peace, is guided by three basic principles: partnership,
                            strength, and willingness to negotiate.</hi></p>
                    <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Partnership</hi>. The obligations of peace, like its
                        benefits, must be shared. Our contribution and success will depend not on
                        the frequency or depth of involvement in the affairs of others, but on the
                        stamina of our policies.</p>
                    <p>More active participation by our friends and allies in their own defense and
                        progress will result in a more effective common effort toward goals we all
                        seek.</p>
                    <p>The fact that the U.S. does not seek to dominate world affairs does not mean
                        that it is moving toward disengagement or returning to isolation. On the
                        contrary, at the core of the Nixon Doctrine is the assumption that we will
                        maintain our commitments; that we will participate in the defense and
                        development of allies and friends; but that we will help only where that
                        help will make a real difference and where it is considered in our interest.
                        This is not a blueprint for a retreat from responsibility. It is a
                        recognition that interests shape commitments, rather than the other way
                        around.</p>
                    <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Strength.</hi> Any suggestion that the defenses of
                        America are weak could lead others to make dangerous miscalculations. We
                        will therefore maintain sufficient strength to deny other countries the
                        ability to impose their will on the United States and its allies. At the
                        same time, we realize that our security as well as the security of other
                        nations depends upon effective arms control. There is no area in which we
                        and the Soviet Union—as well as others—have greater common interest, than in
                        reaching agreement with regard to arms control.</p>
                    <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Willingness to negotiate.</hi> All nations have
                        important national interests to protect. But the most fundamental interest
                        of each lies in building a structure of peace: when peace is threatened the
                        security of all is diminished. America’s commitment to peace is most
                        convincingly demonstrated by its willingness to negotiate points of
                        difference with adversaries as well as with friends in a fair, flexible and
                        businesslike manner. No nation need be our permanent enemy.</p>

                        arms problems ever made by this or any other government, and played a
                        central part in making our preparation for the Strategic Arms Limitation
                        Talks with the Soviet Union, the most thorough in which the U.S. Government

                    <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Peace also has an economic dimension</hi>. Here we seek
                        shared responsibilities in partnership with others to advance our common
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>We will continue to support measures that strengthen the world monetary
                        system and freer trade on which the prosperity and development of most
                        countries, including our own, depend. Economic barriers block more than the
                        free flow of goods and capital across national borders; they obstruct a more
                        open world in which ideas and people, as well as goods and machinery, move
                        among nations with maximum freedom.</p>
                    <p>We look forward to the time when our relations with the Communist countries
                        will have improved to the point where trade relations can increase between
                        us.</p>
                    <p>We will watch with great interest the developing relations between the
                        European Community and other nations, some of which have applied for
                        membership. The Community’s trade policies will be of increasing importance
                        to our own trade policy in the years ahead.</p>
                    <p>Economic development is also an international responsibility: the struggle of
                        developing countries to achieve a satisfactory rate of economic and social
                        progress is one of the great challenges of our times, and as such must be of
                        concern to all. A liberal system of tariff preferences for exports of
                        developing countries, as proposed in the President’s report, is designed to
                        assist the developing countries in their development.</p>
                    <p>d. <hi rend="italic">Foreign aid is not a panacea</hi>. It is a means of
                        supplementing the essential ingredient for progress in the developing
                        world—efforts of the nations themselves to mobilize the resources and
                        energies of their own peoples. New U.S. foreign assistance policies,
                        designed to be more responsive to conditions of 1970’s, are based on these
                        premises:</p>
                    <p>—Multilateral institutions must play an increasing role in the provision of
                        aid.</p>
                    <p>—The developing countries themselves must play a larger part in formulating
                        their own development strategies.</p>
                    <p>—U.S. bilateral aid must carry fewer restrictions.</p>
                    <p>—Private investment must play a central role in the development process, to
                        whatever extent desired by developing nations themselves.</p>
                    <p>—Trade policy must recognize the special needs of the developing
                        countries.</p>

                    <p>7. A durable peace requires a structure of stability within which the rights

                            >Nixon</persName>’s new strategy for peace provides a realistic and

                        relating to the Bicentennial celebration. Within the limits of its resources
                        it also offers assistance to the Commission and other Federal, state,
                        municipal and private institutions on the international aspects of their

                        foreign audiences the Bicentennial and its most important themes and
                        component events. For the same purpose the Agency hopes to expand its

                        performances of American music and for outstanding research on American
                        music. The Agency will also promote the expansion and improvement of English

                        wanted you to proceed with the phase-out since the polls “serve no useful
                        purpose.”</p>
                    <p>At Tab B is a memorandum from you to <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1"
                            >Shakespeare</persName> which would implement the President’s
                        directive.</p>
                    <p>I believe that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should have a full
                        hearing before the President’s directive is implemented since I am sure that
                        a good case could be made for the value of these polls. As you know, the
                        President is not particularly happy with the pollsters at the present
                        moment. Rather than send a directive on this subject it would be preferable
                        to meet with <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName> and discuss
                        means by which the implementation can best be handled. As an initial step, I
                        suggest that you ask <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName> to
                        prepare a carefully reasoned rebuttal and to develop procedures which would
                        better preserve the secrecy of the results of the polls. In the interim,
                            <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName> should reduce the
                        frequency of polls being taken, particularly in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">RECOMMENDATION</p>
                    <p>That you not send a written directive to <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1"

                            would constitute an attempt seriously to distort, since they would be
                            interpreted as being similar in accuracy to American polls. They, of
                            course, are not—being designed instead to serve a particular operational
                            need . . . etc., etc. It should be drafted in a manner to settle blame

                            Revolution Bicentennial Commission and that Commerce planned to submit,
                            on or around May 1, an analysis of exposition projects already provided

                            was “difficult for the Department to comment with any precision on the

                        <salute>Dear Maury:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>Thank you for your letter of March 18<note n="2" xml:id="d81fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d81fn1">footnote 1</ref>, above.</note> on the question of
                        organizing an international exposition in the U.S. as part of the
                        Bicentennial. I hope the enclosed paper is helpful.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of a study forwarded to you earlier this year, we believe there
                        is wide foreign interest in participating in a Bicentennial event. We also
                        believe that foreign participation should be related to the inter-action
                        between this country and the world community. How this can be accomplished
                        will depend on specific provisions of the exposition plan.</p>
                    <p>In the past, expositions have tended to attract foreign participation by
                        pretending that differences between nations did not exist. It might be more
                        useful to focus instead on cooperative means of reducing those differences.
                        For this purpose, projects having the dimension of a Bicentennial should be
                        organized so that their international element contributes to the prospect of
                        a more peaceful world.</p>
                    <p>In our view, some of the exposition projects now being considered offer
                        interesting opportunities in the foreign policy field. We know that other
                        countries have much to contribute to what we are planning in 1976. We also
                        believe that the manner in which we organize an <pb facs="0243" n="191"
                            xml:id="pg_191"/> exposition can give us a better sense of the goals we
                        hope to achieve, at home and abroad, between 1976 and the year 2000.</p>
                    <p>With best personal regards,</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        <p rend="center">(Foreign Policy Aspects)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of Commerce has posed several inter-related questions on
                            the holding of an international exposition in 1976 as part of the
                            Bicentennial. These are:</p>
                        <p>Whether a decision not to host an exposition for the world to attend
                            would have unfavorable foreign policy implications;</p>
                        <p>Whether the organization of such an event would be likely to have an
                            impact on our foreign relations; and</p>
                        <p>Whether international participation in a Bicentennial exposition might be
                            organized in such a way as to clarify U.S. foreign policy aims for the
                            years 1976–2000.</p>
                        <p>In answer to the first question; assuming there will be some form of
                            foreign participation in the Bicentennial, we do not consider it likely
                            that failure to organize a 1976 exposition will impair our relations
                            with foreign countries.</p>
                        <p>It is, of course, more difficult to make prediction about the impact of
                            exposition projects for 1976 that are still only in the planning stage.
                            None of these projects have yet received the official sanction of the
                            Federal Government or the Bureau of International Expositions (<gloss
                                target="#t_BIE_1">BIE</gloss>) in Paris.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, if such an event is to be held, the role which the U.S.
                            government plays as host will have to be clearly defined. This will <pb
                                facs="0244" n="192" xml:id="pg_192"/> have a direct, although
                            short-term, bearing on our relations with participating foreign
                            governments and international organizations.</p>
                        <p>As to the long view, it is generally recognized that, in the past, world
                            expositions have usually celebrated nonpolitical aspirations and
                            achievements. Their impact on foreign affairs has not been of great
                            consequence.</p>
                        <p>It is believed, however, that some of the exposition projects for 1976
                            now being examined might serve as a useful way of charting our nation’s
                            path in the world community during the last quarter of the twentieth
                            century.</p>
                        <p>This thought is reinforced by the study, recently forwarded to you, on
                            the likely interest of some 70 foreign governments in participating in a
                            Bicentennial exposition.<note n="5" xml:id="d81fn5">See the enclosure to
                                    <ref target="#d69">Document 69</ref>.</note> The reasons for
                            this interest are varied. They include a wish to demonstrate bonds of
                            friendship and historical ties with the U.S. Closely related, even in
                            the non-commercial type of exposition sanctioned by the <gloss
                                target="#t_BIE_1">BIE</gloss>, are economic incentives—to promote
                            foreign trade, travel and investment. Probably most fundamental,
                            however, is the compelling need to express a special sense of
                            nationhood.</p>
                        <p>When all factors are considered, it is believed that a Bicentennial
                            exposition might serve a useful role if it could help nations project
                            the cooperative endeavors in the foreign affairs field with which they
                            hope to be associated in the relatively short period of time between
                            1976 and 2000.</p>
                        <p>An effort might be made in the international sector to clarify and
                            substantially further foreign policy aims of participating countries in
                            a much more realistic way than has previously been attempted. Perhaps
                            this could be accomplished through an imaginative project on themes
                            which are basic to our—and to most nations’—international objectives in
                            the coming decades.</p>
                        <p>An exposition might be used to identify common areas of interest. There
                            are many fields of exploration. Among them are a closer partnership of
                            nations in practical efforts for peace; for law; for development; for
                            human rights; for the application of science and technology; for
                            environmental rescue; for arms control and disarmament, etc. Perhaps
                            means of actually carrying forward the efforts toward realization of
                            these goals could be built into the exposition plan through coordinated
                            elements of national pavilions, joint exhibits, working conferences,
                            demonstrations and seminars.</p>
                        <p>Thus, an effort could be made to connect the international component of
                            the exposition in a more visceral way with operating programs <pb
                                facs="0245" n="193" xml:id="pg_193"/> of participating governments.
                            Ideally, the relevance of the exposition, in its foreign affairs aspect,
                            would be confirmed by definitive solutions to problems between nations
                            arrived at in years after the project’s conclusion.</p>
                        <p>Viewed in this light, a 1976 Bicentennial exposition might well serve as
                            a mirror in which to observe not so much reflections but emerging
                            relationships between peoples, governments and the lands they inhabit.
                            Hopefully, a greater sense of common problems to be met by combined
                            effort will diminish the preoccupation of countries with their “image”
                            abroad.</p>
                        <p>These are only a few ingredients of the foreign affairs aspects of the
                            Bicentennial. There are many more, with interesting ramifications in the
                            policy field. They suggest, however, that the vehicle of an
                            exposition—as an inventory of civilization—is still a valid means of
                            making men focus on where they stand in history. But as the pressures of
                            history change, so must the vehicle be susceptible to change. It must
                            adapt itself to the needs of the men who design it.</p>
                        <p>The above paragraph takes into account several innovative exposition
                            projects now under consideration by the President’s American Revolution
                            Bicentennial Commission and the Department of Commerce. It will not be
                            possible to comment on the foreign policy aspects of these proposals,
                            vis-à-vis the more conventional but “socially relevant” exposition
                            projects of other cities, until presentation of the Commerce
                            Department’s analysis scheduled for May 1, 1970.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Your inquiry goes to the heart of an issue I have for many years considered
                        central to the successful conduct of our foreign relations.</p>
                    <p>No organized effort has ever been made to collect and analyze the data with
                        respect to the whole gamut of exchanges (government, private, planned,
                        unplanned, etc.), although there is far more knowledge about these
                        relationships with some countries than with others.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the entire <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> research budget
                        request for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1971 ($100,000) was designed
                        to begin to fill this vacuum by developing systems to make possible
                        intelligent estimates of the extent and impact of existing leadership
                        exchanges between the U.S. and the rest of the world.</p>
                    <p>My <hi rend="italic">impression</hi> is that there is considerable though
                        insufficient, largely unfocused and uncoordinated effort now going into
                        leadership development in the Third World. Some <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                            >AID</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>, <gloss

                        important contributions. So do some foundation supported, business,
                        educational and professional activities.</p>
                    <p>Present managements of both <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> are working to make their own programs more
                        productive in this regard. <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> is now
                        strengthening its organizational capacity both to coordinate governmental
                        efforts and to stimulate and guide private programs. Of course the U.S.
                        International Development Institute, if and when established, should provide
                        major new capabilities.</p>
                    <p>In my opinion, based on prior personal study as well as what I have learned
                        from the experience of <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>, democratic
                        leadership development through properly focused exchanges and other
                        organizational techniques is a highly economical method both of influencing
                        the political process in other countries and of improving the context
                        comprised of relationships and attitudes within which our political,
                        military and <pb facs="0247" n="195" xml:id="pg_195"/> economic relations
                        with those countries are conducted. By strengthening moderate social and
                        political trends, these methods can (at minor cost) be expected over time to
                        reduce significantly the probability of extreme and dangerous behavior by
                        other states, developed as well as undeveloped. In addition, they can
                        significantly affect the predispositions of opinion-makers and
                        decision-makers in positions of direct importance to our national security
                        and other interests.</p>
                    <p>Your inquiry suggests to me the possibility of a new world-wide priority in
                        the focusing of official, as well as other, exchanges. The results of one
                        previous effort may be indicative: the success of the post-war emphasis on
                        bringing leaders and professionals from Germany, to acquaint them with our
                        democratic institutions and to develop new leadership for Germany’s
                        democratic growth. The “foreign leader” program of <gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                            >CU</gloss> was the mechanism utilized to carry out this purpose. In
                        1952, 61 percent of all our leader grantees came from Germany alone. Between
                        1949 and 1962, a total of 5,351 German leaders and specialists were brought
                        to the U.S. under the <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> program. Testimony
                        to the success of this effort has been received within the week from Embassy

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">CORPORATIONS</p>
                    <p>In the increasingly international or multinational form of so many American
                        corporations, they are undertaking more and more participation in
                        communities where they have business operations. Their growing “sense of
                        community” leads both to financial assistance to education, welfare, youth
                        and other activities; it also leads to making executives and staff experts
                        stationed in those countries available to groups of interested nationals.
                        Large numbers of potential leaders become acquainted with management
                        know-how, marketing techniques, etc., and also with the modern business
                        spirit of cooperation and community-relatedness. Unused capabilities are
                        probably vast.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">UNIVERSITIES</p>
                    <p>In numerous programs and projects, including overseas campuses, many American
                        universities are in fact functioning as a vital international force.
                        Examples are literally too numerous to mention. One that is rarely cited,
                        but relevant: a number have sent their presidents or other principal
                        administrators and professors overseas to meet with alumni and, in some
                        instances, <hi rend="italic">their</hi> invited guests. Columbia University
                        has been a bellwether in this; others include the University of Michigan,
                        the University of California (Berkeley), Louisiana State University, etc.
                        The follow-up activities of some institutions have included the sending of
                        the alumni magazine to overseas alumni.</p>

                    <p>There are international professional and common interest associations in
                        almost all fields; a directory of international organizations runs to 1200
                        pages.</p>
                    <p>Their existence presents a challenge to assure the highest possible level of
                        U.S. representation and an opportunity to devise means for stimulation and

                        concept.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">SOME CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS TO BE INCLUDED</p>
                    <p>In thinking of directions of effort your inquiry suggests, I would recommend
                        special attention to professionals and other problem-solving categories,
                        among them those in:</p>
                    <p>—urban planning</p>
                    <p>—environment (pollution control)</p>
                    <p>—population planning</p>
                    <p>—food technology</p>
                    <p>—communication systems development</p>
                    <p>—educational modernization and reform</p>
                    <p>—utilization of marine resources</p>
                    <p>—social work</p>
                    <p>—business management</p>
                    <p>—public administration</p>
                    <p>—education</p>
                    <p>—engineering</p>
                    <p>—journalism</p>
                    <pb facs="0253" n="201" xml:id="pg_201"/>
                    <p>—law</p>
                    <p>—public health</p>
                    <p>—scientists</p>
                    <p>The success of efforts, involving such categories as those above will depend
                        in part on <hi rend="italic">volunteerism</hi>. I would hope for a growing
                        reliance on selected volunteers able and willing to undertake public or
                        private visits overseas, in the context of cooperation and partnership,
                        along lines of common interest.</p>
                    <p>Also, the <hi rend="italic">capacity to communicate</hi>. This is not
                        intended to suggest a premium on fluency, or glibness; but, rather, on the
                        inherent ability of some individuals to communicate their sense of the
                        importance of a professional field, of the environment it needs in which to
                        flourish, and of the interrelatedness and interdependence of people in such
                        a field—regardless of the stages of economic growth of their countries. This
                        capacity to communicate is of course a priceless ingredient in international
                        relations, and essential, I believe, to the success of the concept suggested
                        in your inquiry.</p>
                    <p>I would be happy to pursue further any aspect of this question which you
                        might consider useful.</p>

                    <p>The Agency is well serviced by the Department of State in the matter of ready
                        information on U.S. foreign policy positions and pronouncements. We are
                        severely handicapped on the other hand, when a White House official or
                        spokesman is the source of a policy position. <pb facs="0259" n="207"

                    <p>In establishing the Young Officers’ Policy Panel in your memorandum of
                        February 24, 1969, you charged the Panel to “receive and screen the ideas of
                        all young officers” and to “keep open the Agency’s lines of communications
                        with college students and their organizations.”<note n="2" xml:id="d85fn2"
                            >Attached and printed as <ref target="#d9">Document 9</ref>.</note>
                        Recognizing this dual responsibility, the Panel feels it must try to portray
                        to you the mood of urgency and crisis among many young Americans that has
                        stemmed from the events of the past two weeks.<note n="3" xml:id="d85fn3"
                            >Reference is to the U.S. and South Vietnamese military incursion into
                            Cambodia to destroy sanctuaries on the border, which the President
                            announced during his televised address on April 30 (see <ref
                                target="#d83fn2">footnote 2, Document 83</ref>), and the May 4
                            shooting of 13 people, 4 of them fatally, on the campus of Kent State
                            University in Kent, Ohio. Later that week, protests and student strikes
                            took place at many U.S. colleges and universities, prompting these
                            institutions to end the spring academic semester early.</note> We
                        frankly acknowledge that elements of that mood are shared by many young
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officers.</p>
                    <p>The Cambodian action, the Kent State deaths, the university strikes and
                        demonstrations—all these have led to a notable change in attitude among many
                        American college students. The change is towards a widening bitterness, with
                        more students becoming outspokenly anti-government than heretofore. More
                        politically sensitive young people now see their attempts to alter existing
                        policies as futile, see their choices being cut away from them. The
                        frustration is such that fewer sincere dissenters are capable of recognizing
                        Administration efforts to appreciate their concerns.</p>
                    <p>Trying to capture some of that sense of urgency, <gloss target="#t_YOPP_1"
                            >YOPP</gloss> offers the enclosed paper, “The Mood of Dissent”, an
                        impressionistic account that reflects the minds of many who demonstrated in
                        Washington last May 9th.<note n="4" xml:id="d85fn4">The protest took place
                            on the Ellipse, attended by an estimated 60,000 to 100,000 people. (<hi

                    <p>It is essential that Agency leadership also know of younger officers’ lack of
                        confidence in our ability to advocate public affairs positions at the
                        highest levels of government. The Cambodian action and its aftermath have
                        heightened that feeling. From what we have learned, the Agency was not even
                        called upon officially to present a position before the act.<note n="5"

                        aggressively and courageously advocating public affairs positions on key
                        foreign policy issues, whether requested or not.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the events of the past two weeks have kindled <gloss

                        such events. Our preliminary investigation of <gloss target="#t_IBS_1"

                        lack of a deeper treatment of the background to the complex issues involved.
                        A full report on our media review findings will be presented upon their
                            completion.<note n="6" xml:id="d85fn6">An unknown hand, presumably

                            government officials, and some older people who had brought their kids
                            risking the tear gas that many said was inevitable. Many were out
                            protesting for the first time. These were the people the <gloss

                            who usually watched and went home mumbling about the damn anarchists.
                            They’re the ones who always believed in the system. Now they’re active
                            and convinced that they are the voice of America. Has the middle dropped
                            out? Why?</p>
                        <p>The “Movement” had been telling them for over a year that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName> had no intention of
                            winding down the war. He’s going to expand it, they were told, because
                            he wants to win. The Pentagon will never let us “lose”. But he brought
                            over a hundred thousand troops home. We haven’t started bombing the
                            North again, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> said there would never be any American ground
                            forces in Laos or Cambodia. The New Left told them to wait and see. What
                            can they believe? The “Movement” also told them that oppression was
                            coming and that dissent would be crushed. They didn’t believe it. This
                            is the United States, after all. Then the Vice-President seemed to be
                            appealing to hate; and then “college bums;” and then Kent State. Some
                            construction workers in New York reacted in the finest brown shirt
                            tradition while the police looked on.<note n="10" xml:id="d85fn10"

                            can they believe? Who’s telling it like it is, a glib young aide who
                            comes out of the White House with his bullhorn to “listen” or a buddy
                            who’s had his head busted by some crypto-fascist yelling “love it or
                            leave it.”</p>
                        <p>“The streets of our country are in turmoil. The universities are filled
                            with students rebelling and rioting. Communists are seeking to destroy
                            our country. Russia is threatening us with her might and the Republic is
                            in danger. Yes, danger. Yes, danger from within and without. We need law
                            and order. Without law and order our nation can not survive.”</p>
                        <p>Sound familiar? Most students today know that Adolph Hitler said it in

                        <p>Alienation is that sense of not being able to control one’s life, of the
                            inability to affect anything by one’s action. It’s frustrating,
                            maddening, depressing, destructive—especially when you’re 20. All of the
                            young <pb facs="0263" n="211" xml:id="pg_211"/> people who have been
                            protesting about Cambodia have done so out of frustration, many of them
                            because they are angry, but not yet entirely alienated. No, they
                            probably haven’t dropped out yet. They are, after all, appealing to the
                            system, and in the only way they think will work. You don’t stand
                            outside the White House shouting at your President unless you expect him
                            to hear. You don’t go into the streets and beg for change unless you
                            think change is possible. Those that have been through it before are
                            alienated, and they’re more than frustrated or angry. They were in the
                            streets too. How long will it take the new-comers to become that
                            alienated? They still believe in the system enough to go to Congress, to
                            pledge to work in the next elections to change things. And change is
                            what they want, not just sympathetic ears. How long will it take them to
                            become alienated?</p>

                        memorandum (Tab C) recording his observations at a recent Chiefs of Mission
                        meeting in Africa and the results of his own research into the ages and
                        educational backgrounds of State Department officials dealing with
                        Africa.</p>
                    <p>You might find his conclusions worth reading. He notes that:</p>
                    <p>—a preponderant majority of State Department Africanists come from Harvard,
                        Yale, and Princeton. (He assures you in a cover note that he has nothing
                        against Harvard!)<note n="2" xml:id="d86fn2">Attached but not printed is the

                    <p>—the Chiefs of Mission meeting was dominated by the uniformity of outlook of
                        the career people, and the Administration viewpoint was
                        under-represented.</p>
                    <p>—we send Ambassadors whose average age is 53 to a continent ruled by young
                        leaders, many of whom are in their 30’s.</p>
                    <p>He recommends that we try to:</p>
                    <p>—recruit people of more diverse backgrounds into the career service,
                        disassemble the “African Club” that seems to have come into being, and get
                        younger men into higher career positions.</p>
                    <p>—insure that top-level officials attend Chiefs of Mission meetings, to listen
                        to the Ambassadors and to impress the Administration view on the
                        gathering.</p>

                            memo.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName> is right, of
                            course, about the “sameness of view” in our African corps, but for the
                            wrong reasons. Harvard and Princeton are not to blame for bias, lack of
                            imagination, and differences of view from the Administration’s policy.
                            Rather:</p>
                        <p>—The Foreign Service, as a bureaucratic career system, is a stodgy guild,
                            punishing innovation and dissent and rewarding conformity. With almost
                            no exception, those who rise to the top (and the African Embassies
                            scarcely get the cream) are suitably stagnant products of this
                            system.</p>
                        <p>—Intellectually, the policy views that worry <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1"
                                >Shakespeare</persName> are not the offspring of Eastern
                            universities (which, in fact, give almost no attention to Africa). This
                            set of mind was born in the fit of conversion which the Foreign Service
                            experienced when it discovered decolonization during the late 1950s.
                            Like all late converts who are deeply ridden with the guilt of past sins
                            (in this case, having been hoodwinked by colonial foreign offices), our
                            new African “specialists” swallowed whole the then fashionable
                            “realities.” To wit, that the tide of African nationalism was rolling
                            inexorably south; development proceeded by certain truths; if we don’t
                            “win” Africa, the Soviets will; the Africans unlike most governments
                            mean what they say, nation-states created <pb facs="0266" n="214"
                                xml:id="pg_214"/> in Paris and London are immutable, etc. I am not
                            so worried that these views are contrary to a particular
                            Administration’s policy. The point is that they are demonstrably wrong.
                            And our obsession with them seriously detracts from our ability to cope
                            with Africa in the 70s, especially if the Continent should by some
                            chance become important to us.</p>
                        <p>—As for geographical spread in recruiting for the Foreign Service, the
                            Establishment has been trying to accomplish just that over the past few
                            years. For reasons outlined above this has had no appreciable effect on
                            either bureaucratic mentality or creativity.</p>
                        <p>2. I quite agree that bureaucracy will run with the ball whenever an
                            Administration fails to make itself felt with the presence of senior
                            officers. But what <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName>
                            witnessed was, after all, the result of several African appointments <hi
                                rend="italic">during</hi> the Nixon administration. We have only
                            ourselves to blame for giving State its head in assembling the
                            predictable collection of super-annuated mediocrities on the eve of
                            retirement, for whom Africa is a natural pasture. Ultimately, of course,
                            there is only one answer to reestablishing the authority of the
                            Administration in the bureaucracy, and that is to appoint an Assistant
                            Secretary whose views and loyalty leave no doubt. That is <hi
                                rend="italic">not</hi> the case at present. Of the group <persName
                                corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName> saw, only Bill Roundtree
                            matches those qualities with the requisite ability and experience.</p>
                        <p>3. The problem of youth, to be sure, is most critical. Even if we select
                            from the career service, younger men between 35 and 45 should be getting
                            their experience in running Missions. This would not only benefit the
                            Africans, but just might save a few Foreign Service officers for the
                            psychological and mental paralysis which overtakes them otherwise.</p>
                        <p>The ideal goal is to make Africa a major area of recruitment for young
                            shirt-sleeve Ambassadors from the private sector. After one has
                            satisfied the pretentions of the handful of Oxford or <gloss
                                target="#t_UCLA_1">UCLA</gloss> graduates who govern the host
                            countries, the real job is contact with and assistance to a frontier
                            society. What better place for young lawyers, engineers, journalists and
                            teachers to combine public service with personal diplomacy in the best
                            tradition. The Africans themselves are most susceptible to this
                            informality, and most repelled by the present starchiness, which conveys
                            nothing so much as a confirmation of the racism they suspect of
                            Americans in any case.</p>
                        <p>In sum, I quite agree that the African club should be disbanded. Not that
                            the Continent is important. But there is always the chance that it might
                            be some day. And in the interim, Africa can be used as an effective
                            training ground for a revitalization of our own diplomatic service. Not
                            to mention the real benefits to African development which would come
                            with new injection of youth and imagination in the U.S. presence.</p>

                            the French Ambassadors to the former French black-African countries are
                            doing.</p>

                            in that country are “mounting the barricades” against the government. He
                            left the clear impression that the wish was the father to the thought.

                        <p>My suggestions are these:</p>
                        <p>1. A determined effort should be made by the State Department to recruit
                            young officers of diversified geographical and educational backgrounds
                            so the diverse viewpoints of the entire American people are more
                            thoroughly reflected in the Department.</p>
                        <p>2. I do not know if the African situation regarding the commonality of
                            educational background among Ambassadors is atypical. If so, an “African
                            Club” may have come into being, whether inadvertently or otherwise, and
                            should be gradually disassembled.</p>
                        <p>3. The heads of the foreign policy related agencies should personally

                            have some young careerist ambassadors. Africa, where responsibilities
                            are not always major, would be a good place to assign some. Almost every

                    <p>State’s <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> ’71 Appropriations legislation
                        just out of the House Subcommittee on Foreign Governmental Operations,
                        includes a section (enclosed)<note n="2" xml:id="d87fn2">Attached but not
                            printed is a page containing Section 705 of the Department of State,
                            Justice and Commerce, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriation
                            Bill of 1971. (See <ref target="#d75fn4">footnote 4, Document
                            75</ref>)</note> which I feel may have serious implications for the
                        entire educational and cultural exchange program.</p>
                    <p>The section states that the Department may not give or loan any money to
                        anyone who has participated (or assisted) in any campus disturbance since
                        August 1, 1969. A number of possible problems arise depending on how State
                        decides to implement the measure. Suppose the Department decided to require
                        recipients (both American <hi rend="italic">and</hi> foreign) to sign a
                        statement or affidavit attesting they have not been party to any
                        demonstration. This is a course they are considering. On the face of it this
                        may eliminate some who were actually involved in campus disturbances last
                        year.</p>
                    <p>A much deeper question arises when we consider how such a statement might
                        appear to someone who has not been in any disturbances, but who (1) might
                        sympathize with the objectives of some of these campus activities or, (2)
                        objects to signing a statement which makes (indirectly) his political
                        viewpoint a criterion for a State Department grant or loan.</p>
                    <p>From a public affairs standpoint such a statement or affidavit may appear to
                        a foreign intellectual or student wishing to undertake studies in the U.S.
                        with State support as an intrusion into his behavior or political point of
                        view and conclude it is none of State’s business, with the obvious negative
                        side effects.</p>
                    <p>I understand that State does not plan to appeal the measure. This may be in
                        part a result of the $5.5 million increase <gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                            >CU</gloss> received this year. While it is altogether likely State is
                        aware of the public affairs implications of the issue, I wonder whether
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> might re-emphasize <pb
                            facs="0271" n="219" xml:id="pg_219"/> to State the potential damage such
                        a statement or stipulation might have on its educational and cultural
                        exchange program, as well as the harm it would do to this government’s
                        credibility as a respecter of dissent.<note n="3" xml:id="d87fn3">An unknown

                        jointly hired to advise on the program and to suggest speakers, met to
                        discuss among other things this measure and its possible affect on speakers
                        (STAG’s) for the program. Our consultants bluntly stated that no one they
                        recommended for the program and whom they know personally would agree to
                        sign such a statement whether they had taken part in campus disturbances or
                        not. They added that many young people today would consider such a statement
                        repugnant to their political convictions. (I might add that these are
                        precisely the young people we need for educational and cultural exchange
                        programs who can perhaps broaden the rather narrow picture many of our
                        audiences have of American society these days).</p>

                            >GVN</gloss> was expressed in the rise of “Don’t Know” answers to a
                        question of confidence in the ability of the government to meet the needs of
                        the people in the years ahead. Among the general public, “Don’t Know”
                        responses were up from 38 percent in March to 57 percent in May. The
                        college-educated voicing increased confidence in the <gloss
                            target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>’s ability fell from 19 percent in March to
                        3 percent in May; they listed as reasons the inability of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> to settle the issues involving students
                        and veterans, profiteering and corruption.</p>
                    <p>—In May 1970 those who thought the war would end in a year or less declined
                        to 4 percent from a high of 45 percent of the general public in October
                        1968.</p>
                    <p>—Rating of the U.S. as a dependable ally of <gloss target="#t_SVN_1"
                            >SVN</gloss> reached the lowest point in thirteen Saigon surveys, with
                        only 26 percent of the general public and 23 percent of the college-educated
                        thinking of U.S. as “very dependable” or “rather dependable.”</p>
                    <p>—Forty-four percent of the general public and 68 percent of the
                        college-educated thought the attacks on the sanctuaries would be
                        beneficial.</p>

                    <p>S: I just spoke with <persName corresp="#p_BWF_2">Bill Buckley</persName> and
                        he feels very strongly about an idea he has. He has come to the conclusion
                        that the Administration is losing and there are fishers (or fissures?) on
                        the conservative side which have been with us.</p>
                    <p>K: Why?</p>
                    <p>S: They are deep and maybe you should talk to him. He feels this would be a
                        domestic (?) time to say that people who fight in <gloss target="#t_VN_1"
                            >VN</gloss> will be volunteers. I don’t know if the numbers will
                        work.</p>
                    <p>K: No, we have looked into that.</p>
                    <p>S: He has a flood of mail and the numbers are bothering him about slippage.
                        It would show understanding. He felt cooperate revulsion about Southeast
                        Asia is greater than he thought. I have had a philosophic talk with him.</p>
                    <p>K: If society is so weak ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? /</p>
                    <p>S: Volunteers plus regulars are not enough?</p>
                    <p>K: No. We have looked at it carefully. It’s physically impossible. It’s not a
                        policy choice. We just cannot do it. Not before next year.</p>
                    <p>S: He said in the future it won’t have a feeling of relating.</p>
                    <p>K: Not for the rest of the year.</p>
                    <p>S: I am startled. I don’t share his feeling but—</p>
                    <p>K: Moreover, I expect <persName corresp="#p_BWF_2">Buckley</persName> to
                        fight that sort of thing. Our business elite is just maddening. They have no
                        political sense.</p>
                    <p>S: All during the ’30’s they armed Japan.</p>
                    <p>K: If we let the students drive us out the business people will be their next
                        victims.</p>
                    <p>S: That’s where they will turn?</p>
                    <p>K: We are gaining but the students want to destroy the society.</p>
                    <p>S: I just wanted you to know.</p>
                    <p>K: Bill is gallant and he supports the Administration, I know.</p>

                    <p>S: He says it’s unbearable that parents have wounded and dead sons in S.E.A.
                        because they don’t have the feeling that sons are sacrificed for a<note

                    <p>K: I agree with that.</p>
                    <p>S: He has done a lot of thinking about it. He is in a more contemplative mood
                        than I have ever seen him.</p>
                    <p>K: To lose your forum for the privilege of a slow withdrawal will be any
                        better?</p>
                    <p>S: What will the President say?</p>
                    <p>K: Reaffirming what he has said and the success of the military. The success
                        of withdrawal and so forth.</p>
                    <p>S: Bill’s antenna are so much better than my own. I don’t pick up the
                        crossroads.</p>
                    <p>K: Our elite has collapsed. All over the country it’s disturbing.</p>
                    <p>S: His number in Conn. is 203/DA5–1231.</p>
                    <p>K: I will call him. I have word for you from the President. He wants the
                        fellow that attended the Harriman meeting transferred to a lowly job. He
                        thinks someone has to walk the plank.</p>
                    <p>S: For your private information I took a substantive step. We have one
                        officer who signed the petition over there.<note n="3" xml:id="d89fn3">On
                            May 8, more than 250 Department of State and other foreign affairs

                            of the Inter-agency Youth Committee.</note> That’s the one who showed
                        poor judgment. He has been at State as special advisor for youth affairs for
                        three years. He was scheduled to go to a university to do some extra study.
                        He is being transferred to Bolivia or somewhere in L.A. and I brought him
                        over and gave him a lecture as well. I felt that was substantive. It
                        violated the ethic. But this young man Snyder<note n="4" xml:id="d89fn4">Not

                        He was invited by the Deputy Assistant Secy. of State. He is a member of the

                    <p>K: I didn’t realize it was the Open Forum.</p>
                    <p>S: I talked to the officers and said I didn’t think they understood what
                        career service was about. I thought this was disloyal. Of 250 there were 2
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officers. One is transferred. But

                        sheer size and entertainment value.</p>

                            America Day, a day-long event planned to take place on the grounds of
                            the Washington Monument on Independence Day. The event was scheduled to
                            include an ecumenical prayer service, flag procession, and an evening
                            rally, organized by Walt Disney and <gloss target="#t_MPAA_1"

                            various entertainers, prior to the traditional fireworks display.
                            Entertainer Bob Hope and the Reverend Billy Graham served as the
                            co-chairs of the citizens committee, and hotel owner J. Willard Marriott
                            chaired the executive committee. (“‘Honor America Day’ Set for Capital
                            July 4,” June 5, 1970, p. 39 and “Big July 4 Rally Slated in Capital:

                            Rennie Davis met with the Honor America Day organizers on two successive
                            days and presented a list of demands for the organizers to consider.
                            According to the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>: “The demands
                            included painting the Washington Monument ‘all the colors of the rainbow
                            to symbolize more unity than only shades of red, white, and blue.’ Other
                            suggestions were carrying the flags of the Vietcong and other ‘liberated
                            peoples’ in a parade, and allowing Allen Ginsburg, the poet, to direct a
                            religious service with the Rev. Billy Graham, the evangelist.”
                            (“Radicals Give Demands for July 4 Fete,” ibid., June 26, 1970, p. 16)
                            The Honor America Committee rejected Davis’s demands, while suggesting
                            that Davis, and those accompanying him to the meetings, could propose
                            entertainers to add to the evening rally. (“July 4 Group Bars Radicals’
                            Demands,” ibid., June 27, 1970, p. 25) At a June 29 news conference in
                            Washington, Hope explained that the day’s events were “designed to ‘show
                            Americans can have a good time together despite their differences.’”
                            (“Peak Capital Crowd Foreseen On July 4 Honor America Day,” ibid., June
                            30, 1970, p. 32)</note> By its projected magnitude, a great film could
                        brush aside international borders, (except the Bloc countries) and be a
                        vehicle for <pb facs="0277" n="225" xml:id="pg_225"/> audiences of all ages.
                        Its cast would include Bob Hope, Reverend Billy Graham, <persName

                    <p>We are making a check to see if someone else is going to make a large
                        production of this day. But time is short, the fiscal year is running out
                        and with it our funds that would need to be contracted if no one else is
                        planning its production. We would need your approval as we simultaneously
                        check to see if anyone else has production plans, so as little time as
                        possible is wasted. If no one else is making those plans, we could then move
                        ahead right away. Even with simultaneous approval, time would be terribly
                        short.</p>
                    <p>I think it would be obvious to anyone who would suspect us of “June
                        spending”, this event could be done in no other way since its announcement
                        was only made days ago and contracts must be made prior to the event.</p>
                    <p>We request $180,000 to make this production.</p>
                    <p>We are coordinating with networks and we will shortly send you a proposed

                        write some general notes on the communications vacuum in Cambodia. Jim’s
                        comments follow:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">GENERAL:</p>
                    <p>The ability of the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> to communicate with
                        Cambodia’s rural population is severely limited. Radio, television and
                        motion pictures media resources have been neglected; equipment is old and in
                        disrepair, and trained personnel are few in number. Military communications
                        between army units in the field are sorely lacking, and communications
                        between the field and headquarters are practically non-existant.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_NVN_1">NVN</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_VC_1"
                            >VC</gloss> are reportedly carrying out effective psywar programs
                        designed to reinforce their claim that <persName corresp="#p_SPN_1"
                            >Sihanouk</persName> is the legitimate leader of the people and that the
                            <persName corresp="#p_LN_1">Lon Nol</persName> Government is corrupt,
                        illegal and is using the people of Cambodia to further the interests of
                        their masters, the Americans and America’s allies.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_NVN_1">NVN</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_VC_1"
                            >VC</gloss> soldiers have assumed a new identity. They are now members
                        of <persName corresp="#p_SPN_1">Sihanouk</persName>’s Liberation Army of
                        Cambodia. They have been seen wearing <persName corresp="#p_SPN_1"
                            >Sihanouk</persName> arm-bands. Others wear pictures of <persName
                            corresp="#p_SPN_1">Sihanouk</persName> attached to their caps. It is
                        reported that these troops are well-disciplined and seasoned. It is reported
                        that they have “liberated” villages, given medical aid and food to the
                        people. And this is followed with evening entertainment during which
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPN_1">Sihanouk</persName>’s praises are sung and
                        the traitorous activities of the <persName corresp="#p_LN_1">Lon
                            Nol</persName> Government are exposed ad infinitum. To cement this
                        psychological advantage and to maintain a constant propaganda barrage,
                        Peking and Hanoi beam powerful radio signals that are reportedly heard “loud
                        and clear” throughout the country. The <persName corresp="#p_LN_1">Lon
                            Nol</persName> Government has very little at hand to counter this
                        serious propaganda threat. The <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss> radio is
                        weak and there are insufficient trained programming personnel. However, if
                        steps are not taken immediately to improve Cambodia’s ability to tell its
                        own story, to keep its people informed, to point out <persName
                            corresp="#p_SPN_1">Sihanouk</persName>’s true character and <pb
                            facs="0280" n="228" xml:id="pg_228"/> to exploit his “marriage” to the
                        North Vietnamese and the Chinese Communists, the <persName corresp="#p_LN_1"
                            >Lon Nol</persName> Government might well lose what support it now has
                        in the provinces.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">POSSIBLE COMMUNICATIONS SUPPORT:</p>
                    <p>1. Assess the condition and capabilities of present transmitter facilities.
                        Determine whether it is feasible to repair this equipment. Reportedly, some
                        of it is of Chinese origin.</p>
                    <p>2. Lend a portable transmitter to the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>.
                        It should be kept in mind that the American technical staff should be kept
                        to a minimum. The Cambodians want to do as much as possible on their own and
                        we should respect that desire.</p>
                    <p>3. Urge the Australians to give and install a permanent 50 <gloss
                            target="#t_KW_1">KW</gloss> medium and short wave transmitter in
                        Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>4. Urge the Australians to assign at least one, preferably two, program
                        advisors to the staff of the radio station. This will be essential if a
                        regular flow of material is to be prepared.</p>
                    <p>5. Study the capabilities and potential effectiveness of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> station. There are over 15,000 receiving
                        sets in and around Phnom Penh. As well, with a good antenna, Saigon is
                        received easily.</p>
                    <p>6. Strengthen the <gloss target="#t_GOC_1">GOC</gloss>’s motion picture
                        capability. Reportedly they have cameramen, film and equipment. Their
                        processing ability however, is nil. Through Major <gloss target="#t_Am_1"
                            >Am</gloss> Rong, we have been asked to process footage for the
                        Government. This request has been given to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AN_1">Neil Armstrong</persName> phoned me this morning
                        to express his disappointment that he was unable to “deliver” on getting to
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> exhibit in Novosibirsk.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d93fn3">Presumable reference to “Education <gloss
                                target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>,” displayed in Leningrad, Kiev, and
                            Moscow in 1969 and Baku, Tashkent, and Novosibirsk in 1970. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName> opened the exhibit in
                            Leningrad in July 1969; see <ref target="#d28">Document 28</ref>.</note>
                        He explained he made a continuing effort with his Soviet hosts to include a
                        visit in his itinerary but they consistently scheduled him around this
                        possibility. He said that it became increasingly apparent that he could only
                        have visited the exhibit by rudely breaking his schedule and making a major
                        issue which he felt would have jeopardized the rest of his visit, and
                        perhaps the value of his trip all together. He said the most important parts
                        of his trip included the long meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1"
                            >Kosygin</persName> and a series of relatively substantive talks with
                        important Soviet scientists. Another worthwhile aspect of his visit, Neil
                        said, was the genuine camaraderie which developed between himself and his
                        Soviet cosmanaut hosts. Their reaction to his repeated suggestion to stop at
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> exhibit would have made a direct
                        confrontation necessary to overcome their objections. He regretted the
                        outcome and hoped that I would understand that he had not forgotten my phone
                        request to him prior to his departure.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName> invited him to return to the
                        Soviet Union and the two Soviet cosmanauts told him categorically that he
                        would receive a formal invitation in the not too distant future. Neil said
                        that he hoped that the invitation would be forthcoming and that he would be
                        able to accept it to permit followup meetings with the Soviet scientists
                        with hopefully less time spent viewing Soviet cultural sites.</p>

                    <p rend="center">HIGHLIGHTS</p>
                    <p>In eight countries surveyed around the second week in June, 1970 awareness
                        both of fighting in Cambodia and U.S. participation ranged from 42 per cent
                        in Delhi/Bombay to 78 per cent in Sweden.</p>
                    <p>Among those respondents with opinions about U.S. involvement in Cambodia,
                        disapproval predominated by substantial margins in five countries—France,
                        West Germany, Sweden, Japan and India (Delhi and Bombay). In Great Britain
                        opinions were fairly evenly divided, and only in Australia and Manila did
                        approval prevail.</p>
                    <p>The main reason voiced for approval of the U.S. entry into Cambodia was that
                        the action was required to save the Cambodian government from Communists.
                        This was closely followed by generalized anti-Communist sentiment and the
                        view that the U.S. entry furthered termination of the war.</p>
                    <p>The most frequent reason cited for disapproval of the U.S. entry into
                        Cambodia was that the U.S. allegedly had no business in Indochina. Others
                        saw the action as spreading or lengthening the war, or increasing the danger
                        of Chinese involvement.</p>
                    <p>More generally, reactions to U.S. policies and actions in Viet-Nam were
                        predominantly negative in six of the eight countries surveyed. Only in
                        Australia and Manila did favorable sentiments prevail.</p>
                    <p>With regard to respect for the U.S., substantial declines from the late 1969
                        level were registered in four of the six countries for which trend data are
                        available—Great Britain, France, West Germany, and to a lesser extent,
                        Japan. In Sweden and Manila there were no appreciable changes from prior
                        surveys. No trend measurements are available for Australia and India.</p>
                    <p>Notable shifts in degree of respect for the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> also occurred from late 1969 to mid-1970. There were
                        substantial trend increases in respect <pb facs="0283" n="231"
                            xml:id="pg_231"/> for the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in
                        Sweden and Britain, declines of comparable magnitude in France and Manila,
                        and no appreciable change in West Germany and Japan.</p>
                    <p>Comparison of these trends for the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        with those of the U.S. indicates that the U.S. has lost much of its earlier
                        lead over the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in four countries, has
                        completely lost its lead in Sweden, and only in Manila is there a greater
                        U.S. lead than before.</p>
                    <p>The change in confidence in U.S. ability to deal wisely with world problems,
                        from before to after U.S. entry into Cambodia, is the most dramatic trend in
                        the present study. The losses in confidence range from large to very large
                        in five of the six countries for which trend data are available. In the
                        sixth, Manila, the trend is also downward, but not large enough to be wholly
                        conclusive.</p>
                    <p>During this same time span, namely from late 1969 to mid-1970, the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> suffered only limited losses in
                        confidence in France, West Germany, and Manila, gained somewhat in Sweden,
                        and showed no appreciable change in Great Britain and Japan.</p>
                    <p>The consequences of these trend changes is to leave the U.S. with a greatly
                        reduced margin of leadership over the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        in extent of foreign confidence in its ability to deal wisely with world
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>An additional measurement of confidence in the U.S. was available from Great
                        Britain in a May 7–10 survey, only about a week after the U.S. entry into
                        Cambodia. This study showed British confidence to be somewhat lower in May
                        than in June. The possibility therefore arises that the current
                        comparatively low levels of confidence in the U.S. represent increases from
                        even lower levels more immediately after the U.S. entry into Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>To shed some light on the possible reasons for the current low levels of
                        confidence in the U.S., respondents in each of the eight countries were
                        first asked whether their confidence had recently gone up or down. “Gone
                        down” responses prevailed in seven countries and were a standoff in the
                        eighth (Manila). Next, the respondents reporting changes in attitudes were
                        asked for reasons. Most often cited as a cause for decline in confidence was
                        U.S. entry into Cambodia, or more generally, U.S. actions in Viet-Nam. The
                        reasons given for increases in confidence were for the most part too few for
                        a meaningful picture.</p>
                    <p>Further indication of the influence of the U.S. entry into Cambodia on levels
                        of confidence in the United States is provided by comparisons in confidence
                        by respondents who approved of U.S. entry into Cambodia versus those who
                        disapproved. The results show quite clearly <pb facs="0284" n="232"
                            xml:id="pg_232"/> that large losses in confidence are associated with

                        has its place but not at the complete exclusion of the very popular country
                        western.</p>

                    <p>Country western music represents the very foundations of America and its

                        culture abroad. Perhaps far too little emphasis has been placed over the
                        years on the exportation of programs which represent the taste of the
                        majority of Americans.</p>

                        gave ten performances (four in Yugoslavia, three in Romania and three in
                        Poland) to audiences which displayed extraordinary enthusiasm. Comments from
                        the audiences and in the press were unanimously positive with phrases such
                        as “fantastic,” “of high excellence,” “unbelievable and incredible” and “a
                            <pb facs="0288" n="236" xml:id="pg_236"/> revelation” peppering the
                        reviews. All of our Embassies reported that the group left overwhelmingly
                        favorable impressions in each country.</p>
                    <p>The one sour note of the tour developed in Romania where Romanian officials
                        objected to the “sensuous” body movements of the ensemble and the
                        high-decibel volume of their amplifier. Although the group was prepared to
                        modify certain aspects of its performing technique in order to meet these
                        objections, they felt they could not radically change their performing style
                        in order to accommodate the Romanian’s demands. At that juncture the
                        Romanians unilaterally cancelled the <gloss target="#t_BST_1">BST</gloss>’s
                        final performance which was to have been a benefit concert in Ploesti with
                        proceeds going to Romanian flood victims. (The reason for this cancellation
                        was never publicized.) This cancellation followed two performances in
                        Bucharest to wildly enthusiastic audiences which screamed for numerous
                        encores. At the second of these performances the Romanians used Militiamen
                        with police dogs to sweep the stadium in order to get all the spectators to
                        leave. Notwithstanding this sour note, our Embassy noted that in terms of
                        cultural propaganda the <gloss target="#t_BST_1">BST</gloss> appearances
                        “made it possible for us to reach a part of our target audiences never
                        touched before.” The Embassy added that the cancellation was clearly a
                        Romanian political reaction to “an unbelievably successful reception for
                            <gloss target="#t_BST_1">BST</gloss> by young Romanians.”</p>
                    <p>The large film crew which accompanied the <gloss target="#t_BST_1"
                            >BST</gloss> group on its tour filmed certain scenes (e.g., Polish
                        militiamen seeking <gloss target="#t_BST_1">BST</gloss> autographs, Romanian
                        militiamen on guard duty during the <gloss target="#t_BST_1">BST</gloss>
                        performances) which may cause problems if used in the final film version
                        since filming of uniformed officials is not allowed without prior
                        permission. We have alerted the Cultural Presentations office at the State
                        Department about our views on this subject and I understand from <persName

                        organization—the “Dom Omladine” (House of Youth)—press, radio and <gloss

                        jazz.</p>
                    <p>The impressive welcome, with the Belgrade orchestra playing classic <persName
                            corresp="#p_ED_1">Ellington</persName> compositions in the airport
                        terminal, was slightly delayed because of the fact that the group had
                        arrived without Yugoslav visas. The “Duke” himself was passed through
                        customs without delay and smilingly took over from leader Vojislav SIMIC the
                        direction of the pleased Belgrade musicians who performed with such vigor
                        that all activity in the airport terminal including announcements of plane
                        arrivals and departures was forced to a halt.</p>
                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_ED_1">Ellington</persName> orchestra played its
                        first concert in the large “Dom Sindikata” hall in central Belgrade less
                        than three hours later. Despite the fact that it was already off season and
                        the temperatures soared, well over 1,000 Belgrade jazz buffs were on hand
                        enthusiastically <pb facs="0290" n="238" xml:id="pg_238"/> applauding the
                        orchestra for which they had been waiting for so many years. The Duke was
                        scheduled to perform in Yugoslavia in 1963 under <gloss target="#t_CUCP_1"
                            >CU/CP</gloss> sponsorship but the tragic death of President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> resulted in a cancellation and
                        seven more years of effort before the Youth Hall was able to arrange the
                        present appearance.</p>
                    <p>The first concert ended at 7:30 p.m. with the Duke enthusiastically telling
                        his equally enthusiastic audience “Volim Vas Ludo” (Serbo-Croatian for “I
                        Love You Madly”) his usual closing lines. The audience responded with a
                        crescendo of applause.</p>
                    <p>Despite his obvious fatigue the Duke was prevailed upon to give two
                        interviews during the short one hour pause between performances. The first
                        was for <gloss target="#t_UPI_1">UPI</gloss> correspondent Richard Sudhalter
                        and an Embassy employee taping for <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>. The
                        second was for a group of Yugoslav journalists representing the Belgrade
                        press, a jazz publication, a popular radio disc jockey, “MiniMax”, and the
                        Macedonian press. Both interviews were directed toward the Duke’s musical
                        career, his views on music, art and philosophy of life. The press, radio and
                            <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> coverage flowing from the interviews,
                        both in Belgrade and Dubrovnik, has been outstanding. It will be submitted

                    <p>The second performance of the evening (and the final one in Belgrade) was
                        attended by more than 1,500 enthusiastic jazz fans and was broadcast live by
                        both Radio and <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> Belgrade. A feature of the
                        program proudly announced by the sponsors was the first European performance

                        Mrs. Leonhart.</p>
                    <p>The schedule of the <persName corresp="#p_ED_1">Ellington</persName>
                        orchestra in Yugoslavia initially included a performance in Zagreb, which
                        was regrettably scratched when the sponsoring Croatian organization withdrew
                        its projected sponsorship. The gap in the program was quickly filled a week
                        before their arrival by the Concert Agency and the organizers of the
                        Dubrovnik Summer Festival who broke tradition by including JAZZ for the
                        first time in this traditionally classical program. The Embassy was at least
                        partially instrumental in making this possible by underwriting $1,500 (in
                        GOE dinars) of the $4,000 orchestra fee for this performance. It might be
                        added parenthetically that the Belgrade Bank of Commerce was also a
                        contributing sponsor in making the necessary exchange of dinars into dollars
                        to pay the orchestra and by otherwise helping in <pb facs="0291" n="239"
                            xml:id="pg_239"/> defraying costs through paid advertisements. The bulk
                        of the $6,000 fee for the two Belgrade performances was covered however by
                        Belgrade Radio/<gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss> and the Yugoslav Cultural Advisor
                        accompanied the orchestra to Dubrovnik on July 15. The day in Dubrovnik
                        began with a two hour press interview by correspondents from “Politika”,
                        “Vjesnik”, “Oslobodjenje”, “Dubrovacki Vjesnik”, Zagreb Radio/<gloss
                            target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss>, “Slobodna Dalmacija”, the Hungarian
                        language press from the Vojvodina and representatives of the Dubrovnik
                        Festival. The publicity manager of the Festival took it upon himself to
                        translate in full a letter sent to <persName corresp="#p_ED_1">Duke
                            Ellington</persName> by President <persName corresp="#p_NP_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> applauding his current trip abroad as an important
                        means of bringing part of American culture to people abroad.</p>
                    <p>Most interesting was a question asked by Mr. Nikita PETRAK, the music editor
                        of Zagreb Radio/<gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss>, who inquired whether
                            <persName corresp="#p_ED_1">Ellington</persName> knew <persName
                            corresp="#p_CW_1">Willis Conover</persName> of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss>. When the Duke responded that he knew <persName
                            corresp="#p_CW_1">Conover</persName> personally, Petrak commented that
                            <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Willis Conover</persName> is fondly
                        considered to be the principal tutor and friend of a whole generation of
                        Yugoslav jazz buffs. Petrak went on to say that not only have he and
                        thousands of Yugoslav youth learned and kept abreast of the best in popular
                        music through Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Conover</persName>’s program
                        but for over 15 years he has also been their inspiration and teacher of
                        English. Petrak’s spoken (American) English is letter perfect and one can,
                        in fact, easily detect the tonal qualities of <persName corresp="#p_CW_1"
                            >Conover</persName>’s voice.</p>
                    <p>An excellent review by music critic TOMASEK in the July 17 issue of <hi
                            rend="italic">Vjesnik</hi> sums up the general reaction of the Yugoslav
                        press and the Dubrovnik Festival audience: “This was a display presented in
                        the most serious vein—according to Stravinsky<note n="4" xml:id="d98fn4"
                            >Presumable reference to Soviet composer, pianist, and conductor Igor
                            Stravinsky.</note>—of the best in the musical entertainment in the
                            <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>. This was the ideal answer to the
                        dilemma as to whether such music belongs in the Dubrovnik Festival. In my
                        opinion the level of this performance should be the standard according to
                        which future performances of this kind are to be included.”</p>
                    <p>The 9 p.m. concert of the <persName corresp="#p_ED_1">Duke
                            Ellington</persName> orchestra on an outdoor terrace of one of the
                        towers ringing the walled city of Dubrovnik was heard not only by the
                        overflow crowd of 1,300 plus but, seemingly, by everyone within the city.
                        The Duke and his orchestra departed Dubrovnik by early flight on July 16
                        bound for Palermo.</p>
                    <p>The visit of the <persName corresp="#p_ED_1">Duke Ellington</persName>
                        orchestra to Yugoslavia can be considered an outstanding success.
                        Professionally, the orchestra performed without flaw and met every
                        expectation. “The Duke” was, as <pb facs="0292" n="240" xml:id="pg_240"/>
                        usual, a charming Ambassador of Good Will and the orchestra members were
                        likewise, both onstage and off.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">NOTE</hi>: The purpose of the Agency Program Memorandum is
                        to furnish guidance for the preparation of the Agency’s budget presentation
                        to the Office of Management and Budget and for the preparation of Area
                        Program Memoranda and Media Planning Papers for fiscal 1971 and 1972. It
                        will be sent to posts to inform the staff in the field of guidelines and
                        priorities the Agency has set for the program as a whole. This is the first
                        year in which an Agency Program Memorandum has been prepared, hence the
                        format is still experimental.</p>
                    <p>The mission of the Information Agency, briefly stated, is to advance United
                        States foreign policy in two ways: by communicating directly with the people
                        of other nations, and by advising the President and his foreign affairs
                        representatives with regard to the implications of foreign public opinion
                        for U.S. policies.</p>
                    <p>Of all the agencies of the government, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        alone is responsible for conducting overseas information and cultural
                        programs. It is the <pb facs="0293" n="241" xml:id="pg_241"/> government’s
                        principal instrument of public diplomacy. In this role, it has a continuing
                        responsibility to build respect abroad for the United States, to deepen
                        understanding, on the part of its audiences overseas, of the basic
                        principles that shape America’s approach to foreign affairs, and to seek
                        support for specific policies and actions. From this responsibility, and
                        from the Agency’s role as advisor on foreign public opinion—both in the
                        Executive Branch in Washington and in U.S. Missions abroad—flow the unique
                        contribution <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is called upon to make
                        in the government’s conduct of foreign relations.</p>
                    <p>The President’s comprehensive foreign policy message, “A New Strategy for
                            Peace,”<note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2">See <ref target="#d78fn2">footnote 2,
                                Document 78</ref>.</note> provides <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> with direction for setting goals and operational
                        priorities. The Administration’s emphasis on systematic planning and
                        improved management also imposes upon the Agency the obligation to plan
                        ahead and to review its operations even more carefully than in the past in
                        order to insure the best use of its human and material resources.</p>
                    <p>The Agency will have to be innovative in the years ahead, and not for
                        budgetary reasons alone. As it reviews its operations in the light of the
                        President’s message, the Agency will bear in mind that the new foreign
                        policy predicates a more discriminating U.S. role in world affairs. The
                        President’s concept of partnership suggests that the U.S. will have to lower
                        its voice. As the U.S. intends to carry “less of the load,” the Agency, too,
                        may do fewer things in some places. This will mean, in many cases, limiting
                        quantities of direct output and developing two-way communications techniques
                        which will convey our information and our views without suggesting that we
                        see ourselves sitting “at the head of the table.” In some countries, an
                        additional factor of increasing government restrictions on foreign
                        information activities will limit the scope and affect the style of <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> operations.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, even with these constraints, a number of factors indicate a
                        need for increased or intensified <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        action in certain sectors. The foreign policy enunciated by the President
                        implies expansion of efforts to communicate with the Soviet Union and
                        Eastern Europe, and the Agency will wish to concentrate greater financial
                        and personnel resources in that area as new opportunities open. The
                        sophistication of audiences and media in Western Europe and Japan—assigned
                        highest foreign policy priority by the President—demands intense effort and
                        more sophisticated communication techniques on the part of <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, if it is to reach them. In fact
                        audiences and media everywhere are becoming more discriminating, especially
                        as more and more media products from a variety of sources compete for their
                            atten<pb facs="0294" n="242" xml:id="pg_242"/>tion. With television
                        growing in importance in most countries, the Agency will have to make
                        significantly greater use of this medium. The Agency will have to give
                        increased attention, too, to the professionalism of its staff, both in
                        Washington and overseas, which means broadened and intensified training for
                        both American and foreign national personnel. These tasks will have to be
                        accomplished without additional funding and with reduced personnel. For
                        example, there are nearly 20% fewer American <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> employees overseas now than there were three years
                        ago.</p>
                    <p>All this indicates the need for change in the Agency’s way of managing its
                        affairs and going about its business. In the next few years, it will be
                        essential that the Agency continuously review priorities to insure the best
                        use of resources, progressively adjusting its structure and operations to
                        the needs of public diplomacy in the decade just begun.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">I.</hi> THE AGENCY AS ADVISOR.</p>
                    <p>Though by its nature less visible and less dependent on major resources, and
                        perhaps inherently less capable of systematic structuring, the Agency’s
                        advisory role is as important as its communication function. In the long
                        run, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s goals will often best be
                        served by its helping to improve the psychological impact of all U.S.
                        Government actions overseas. This it can do in its advisory role, through
                        active participation in decision making in the Executive Branch of the
                        government in Washington and in country teams abroad.</p>
                    <p>The President’s “new strategy” entails a new level of sensitivity to the
                        perceived interests of other nations; the Agency’s policy and research
                        mechanisms must be further refined to enable the Director to provide the
                        President with accurate information and analysis of foreign opinion for his
                        policy decisions. Public Affairs Officers abroad must regard themselves as
                        part of these policy and research mechanisms as well as users of the
                        information and analysis in advising their Ambassadors.</p>

                    <p>In his comprehensive message, “U.S. Foreign Policy for the 1970’s: A New
                        Strategy For Peace,”<note n="3" xml:id="d99fn3">Ibid.</note> the President
                        sets forth a foreign policy based on three elements: Partnership with
                        friends, strength, and the willingness to negotiate differences with
                        adversaries. It is the Agency’s task to relate American positions and
                        actions over the coming years to this concept in order to help key audiences
                        abroad see specific decisions as parts of a whole.</p>
                    <p>Much of this will find its expression in themes devised country by country
                        and area by area. Some themes, however—especially those designed to show the
                        United States as a strong, creative, and forward looking nation and thus a
                        worthy and desirable partner—have broader relevance and will receive the
                        priority attention of Agency media.</p>

                    <p>The Agency’s principal message is that the U.S. wishes to contribute to the
                        achievement of a stable peace which will permit the nations of the world,
                        acting in a climate of mutual respect, to develop their own potential, to
                        choose their own form of government, and to work together to solve shared
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>a. The United States, acting in a spirit of partnership, will, where this is
                        consistent with its own national interest, participate in the defense and
                        development of allies and friends on the basis of mutual consultation and
                        responsibility.</p>
                    <p>b. Where its interests conflict with the interests of other nations, the
                        United States will actively seek areas of accommodation and will maintain a
                        willingness to negotiate.</p>
                    <p>c. “Where it makes a real difference and is considered in our interest,” the
                        United States is ready to cooperate with other nations and with
                        international organizations to assist those countries which undertake
                        programs of modernization based on the principle of self-help.</p>
                    <p>d. The United States recognizes that unchecked pollution of the air, land and
                        sea constitutes a world-wide threat to human life, and is <pb facs="0296"

                        means to reverse the trend toward degradation of the environment. Since all
                        efforts may be meaningless if the population of the planet continues to
                        increase at present rates, the U.S. will participate in international
                        programs aimed at halting the population explosion.</p>

                    <p>The approaching bicentennial celebration offers the Agency a unique
                        opportunity to project the United States of the present against the backdrop
                        of its history—to discuss the experience and the democratic values that have
                        emerged from the nation’s first two hundred years, and to convey the
                        dynamism and diversity of the American society which must meet the tests of
                        the 1970s.</p>
                    <p>a. Rapid economic and technological development has brought the nation
                        unprecedented prosperity but has also created new environmental and social
                        problems. Americans are going through a period fraught with tensions but
                        rich in promise as they seek solutions that will assure equal opportunity
                        and improve the quality of life for all citizens.</p>
                    <p>b. The diversified structure of American mass education, always a subject of
                        controversy and experiment, has been a vital factor in the country’s growth.
                        Americans are now engaged in fresh debate and testing to make education
                        responsive to the needs of today and tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>c. The variety of expression in the arts, the innovation and experimentation,
                        reflect the diversity and vigor of contemporary America.</p>
                    <p>d. Americans have put scientific research and technology to work to satisfy
                        human needs, and much knowledge and experience gained, as in the space
                        program, is available to all nations.</p>

                    <p>1. Close collaboration with ARA and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"

                    <p>2. Be sure CAOs are directing priorities toward making a real contribution to
                        changing needs. May need re-shuffling of priorities, with changes and
                        increases where possible and new initiatives not necessarily wedded to
                        traditional arrangements and levels.</p>
                    <p>3. Encourage new initiatives—cooperative arrangements, new directions, pursue
                        new resources and sources of funds to accomplish new initiatives in
                        promising non-academic program areas. Cooperation of private industry as a
                        source of funds, etc. not really tapped; new types of approaches need to be
                        explored and developed.</p>
                    <p>4. Binational commission business should be directed toward enabling it to
                        becoming a growing force in bringing in other sources of support.
                        Commissions should be encouraged to engage in more service activities that
                        can have a multiplier effect. Commission programs should focus sharply on
                            <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> program objectives and priorities. Be
                        sure we have efficient and effective interaction of post, commission, and
                            <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> in planning and carrying out
                        programs, in pursuing priorities, and in developing real U.S. post
                        institution inter-action on the conduct of specific projects.</p>
                    <p>5. Keep reminding host countries and institutions that our responses in the
                        future will depend heavily on what they contribute financially.</p>
                    <p>6. Keep the posts alerted to keeping a sharp focus on innovative programs,
                        new targets, new program resources, new sources of funds.</p>

                        sponsored musical group, “Blood, Sweat and Tears,” proved to be highly
                            successful.<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">For a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"

                        turned out for the performances in each country and were wildly
                        enthusiastic. Indeed, the Romanian authorities cancelled the final concert
                        in Romania (a benefit performance for flood victims), undoubtedly fearing
                        they could not contain exuberant crowds.</p>
                    <p>The tour through the communist countries apparently had a constructive impact
                        on the members of the band, who on return reflected more balanced
                        perspectives about the United States. Their new outlook was picked up in the
                        press—and, as a result, the radical left (led by Mr. Abbie Hoffman) picketed
                        the band’s concert in New York charging that the band had become
                        “pig-collaborators.”</p>

                        <p>The contemporary American musical group, Blood, Sweat and Tears, recently
                            returned from a visit to Yugoslavia, Poland and Romania under our
                            auspices. They waived their normal performance fee of $25,000 per night
                            for this tour. Audience reception to the ten concerts was outstandingly
                            favorable, and our Embassies reported that they were able for the first
                            time to reach and communicate with youthful audiences. Over 15,000
                            persons attended the concerts in Yugoslavia; more than 20,000 in
                            Romania; and 18,000 in Poland.</p>
                        <p>The Reader’s Digest assigned Mr. Ira Wolfert to accompany the tour. In a
                            letter dated July 28 to Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_REL_1"
                                >Richardson</persName>, Mr. Wolfert summarized his conclusions as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“I scored the tour A plus.</p>
                        <p>“Here were the American Establishment and its youthful opposition getting
                            together to present a very bright aspect of the quality of present-day
                            American life to peoples whose own media have been enjoying a field-day
                            coloring it all horrible.</p>
                        <p>“The audiences got the message. The ovations they thundered forth were
                            described to me by knowledgeable people I consulted in all three
                            countries visited as ‘historic, unprecedented,’ and they were for
                            America as much as for the band as the Bucharest audiences made clear by
                            greeting the conclusion of the last encore with a chant of ‘<gloss
                                target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>’
                            that went on until the police stopped it.</p>
                        <p>“Although the police stopped it, it’s hard to believe it will not linger
                            on in the hearts of those who raised the cry.</p>
                        <p>“The taxpayers got a bargain this time and I look forward to more like
                            them.”</p>
                        <p>Earlier, on July 13 in a telephone conversation with our Office of
                            Cultural Presentations, Mr. Wolfert described the tour as “A very large
                            plus for the United States and the State Department.” He added that <pb
                                facs="0310" n="258" xml:id="pg_258"/> “As a result of this tour,
                            Communist propaganda will have a harder time convincing those people.”
                            The final concert in Romania, scheduled to be held in Ploesti as a
                            benefit for flood relief, was cancelled by the Romanian authorities. Mr.
                            Wolfert, commenting on the cancellation, said:</p>
                        <quote><p>“It was cancelled because the Government of Romania was afraid
                                that they would be blown out of power by saxophones. They were
                                afraid there would be people coming down the streets like Hungary or
                                Czechoslovakia. They didn’t want any more people being too joyful.
                                The cancellation was a tribute to Blood, Sweat and
                            Tears.”</p></quote>
                        <p>The tour apparently had a constructive effect on the youthful members of
                            the Band who, on their return, reflected new perspectives about the
                            United States. Before they left, two of them in particular indicated
                            views held by other youthful American college-age students regarding
                            Cambodia, Viet-Nam and race relations. On their return to the United
                            States, the Band’s drummer, in an interview published in the New York
                            Post on July 10, declared:</p>
                        <quote><p>“Communism is a stone drag. Before the trip I thought all that
                                stuff about Communism was American propaganda. But now I know I
                                could never live that way.”<note n="5" xml:id="d104fn5">The
                                    President bracketed this paragraph.</note></p></quote>
                        <p>The drummer also said he expected to be criticized by the radical left in
                            the United States because of his conclusions: “But they ought to go over
                            and see for themselves,” he added.</p>
                        <p>On July 19 the New York Times published a long article on the return of
                            the Band under the headline, “Lessons for a Rock Group.”<note n="6"

                            >Shakespeare</persName>, however, is very concerned that the President
                        see the memorandum, recognizing that it may not be well received. He told me
                        that world-wide reaction is mounting on this issue and that consequently he
                        wants the memorandum to go to the President. I told Henry that I would bring
                        it to your attention first.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday’s meeting set in train a series of diplomatic actions which must be
                        undertaken promptly before any public posture is taken on recent evidence of
                        Soviet/Egyptian cheating in the Middle East.<note n="2" xml:id="d105fn2"

                        route has been properly assessed can we determine what kind of public
                        posture the President should take. In either event, I doubt that he would
                        wish to resort to such a drastic solution but rather that we will proceed
                        much along the lines of the earlier violation case by using a fairly
                        controlled public release stance. On the other hand, <persName
                            corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName>’s memorandum does suggest that
                        a head of steam may be building which is somewhat more severe than
                        yesterday’s meeting would have reflected.</p>

                            many will carry it live and all will tape it for fast play back.</p>
                        <p>B. Your statement should consist of (1) evidence and (2) conclusions. All
                            relevant photos and technical data proving the violations of the
                            cease-fire should be released and as much of Soviet private assurances
                            on the cease-fire as you may choose.</p>
                        <pb facs="0314" n="262" xml:id="pg_262"/>
                        <p>C. That you emphasize violations by the <hi rend="italic">Soviet
                                Union</hi> rather than Egypt. The Soviets would surely like any
                            confrontation on violations to be between Egypt and the United States
                            and will make every effort to play it that way. This should be precluded
                            by the nature of your remarks. In doing so, you will also put
                            considerable psychological pressure on <persName corresp="#p_NGA_1"
                                >Nasser</persName> by implicitly reducing him to a Soviet
                            puppet.</p>
                        <p>D. Having proved the violations beyond doubt, declare that unless the
                            missiles are removed to their pre-August 7 positions within a reasonable
                            time, you will take steps to provide the Israelis the means to redress
                            the military balance.</p>
                        <p>E. Make clear that the Soviet perfidy places in serious doubt the
                            validity of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> talks which, in
                            the final analysis, are based on the faith and confidence the
                            contracting powers have in each other.<note n="6" xml:id="d105fn6">The
                                formal talks began in Helsinki on November 17, 1969, and concluded
                                on December 22. The second round of talks took place in Vienna
                                beginning on April 16, 1970.</note></p>
                        <p>I am convinced that unless we react strongly and promptly against these
                            violations, the credibility of the United States and your credibility
                            will suffer almost irretrievable damage.</p>
                        <p>By linking Middle-East missilery violations to the <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> talks which themselves relates to
                            missilery, you will help Jewish and liberal bodies throughout the world
                            to view the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> talks in a more
                            realistic light.</p>
                        <p>Another effect will be to raise a major caution light to the West German
                            government as to the wisdom and possible dangers of Ost Politik.</p>

                        Washington time), and our people were able to report nothing on the latest
                        developments. However, they are checking to see whether comment might have

                    <p>In Israel, there have been no new developments in the last 24 hours. However,
                        there has been a cumulative buildup of disappointment since the cease-fire
                        went into effect over the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> failure to take
                        action on the reported violations of the standstill. There is increasing

                        Russians and not living up to its previous assurances to Israel. This,

                        crisis,” resulting from a widespread belief that the Israeli Minister of

                            international exhibitions, outlined the responsibilities of organizers
                            and participants, and established the <gloss target="#t_BIE_1"

                    <p>1. United States continues to feel that, despite violations, it would be best
                        for all to get negotiations underway since only hope for peace in Middle
                        East rests in common understandings between Arab nations and Israel.</p>

                        field officers are to continue to emphasize Soviet duplicity in standstill
                        violations.</p>
                    <p>3. Although both sides have committed violations of standstill, violations
                        are substantively different. Soviet Union-<gloss target="#t_UAR_1"
                            >UAR</gloss> have constructed new missile sites and moved missilery
                        nearer Canal while Israel has conducted reconnaisance flights over a
                        prohibited area. On Egyptian side new sites have been constructed for SA2
                        missiles, sites formerly under construction have been completed and
                        missilery has been moved closer to Canal. These violations started
                        immediately upon advent of Cease-Fire-Standstill and have steadily
                        continued. It is known that Soviet personnel participate directly in missile
                        movements and in management of Egyptian defense system.</p>

                        East. Linkage between these two situations relates to duplicity of Soviet
                        regime, which showed in each case that it cannot be trusted. It is worth
                        noting that Gromyko was Soviet Foreign Minister who lied to President

                        that at 6:00 Chicago time they will be coming out with a big story.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d109fn2">“They” is in reference to the editorial staff of
                            the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Sun-Times</hi>. On September 17, while in
                            Chicago, the President met with the paper’s editorial staff. According
                            to <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, who described the
                            incident in his memoirs: “<persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName>
                            had just learned of the outbreak of civil war in Jordan. Though usually
                            his self-discipline was monumental, it could be breached by emotion at
                            moments of high tension. Charged up by the news and the military
                            movements he had just approved, <persName corresp="#p_NP_1"
                                >Nixon</persName> proceeded to tell the amazed editors that if Iraq
                            or Syria intervened in Jordan only the Israelis or the United States
                            could stop them; he preferred that the United States do it.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> continued, “It was too much
                            to expect that such sensational news could be kept off the record. The
                                <hi rend="italic">Sun-Times</hi> ran the exact quote in an early
                            edition. Though it was then withdrawn when Ziegler insisted on the
                            off-the-record rule, this only heightened its foreign policy impact.”

                        editors and broadcasters—“If the Syrians or Iraquis intervene in Jordan
                        there are only <pb facs="0320" n="268" xml:id="pg_268"/> two of us to stop
                        them, the Israelis or us. It will be preferable for us to do it. The
                        Russians are going to pay dearly for moving the missiles in. The Israelis
                        are going to get five times as much as they would have if the missiles would
                        not have moved. We are embarking on a tougher policy in the Middle East. The
                        Sixth Fleet is going to be beefed up. I was having an argument with
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> who thinks we blew it
                        in Jordan. We will intervene if the situation is such that our intervention
                        will make a difference.” Chicago Sun Times is saying as a lead that it was
                        learned today from high sources that the U.S. will intervene in Jordan if
                        the Syrians or Iraquis move. I know what the editors were told, but I don’t
                        know how they will write it.</p>
                    <p>K: What does he mean that I thought we blew it in Jordan. I have been raising
                        hell with him along the lines that we have been behaving and that Jordan was

                    </list>
                    <p>Sequence of events in this situation was as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. Yesterday afternoon <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> was reliably
                        informed of the President’s remarks to the Sun Times<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d110fn2">See <ref target="#d109">Document 109</ref>.</note> and
                        that the paper would play them on a headline-basis, starting with the
                        edition at 6:00 p.m. Chicago time.</p>
                    <p>2. I immediately informed <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Al Haig</persName> and
                        had our officers inform State. We instructed our Chicago <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> man to get the first edition of the Sun
                        Times as it came off the press. We instructed <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> operations to stand alert for a significant news break.</p>
                    <p>3. Upon publication, <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> used the Sun Times
                        story (U.S. might intervene if Iraq or Syria act), with attribution <hi
                            rend="italic">only</hi> to the Sun Times . . . “A Chicago paper, the Sun
                        Times, says tonight that it has learned, etc.” No mention was made of the
                        President or the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. It was treated as a
                        news item only.</p>
                    <p>4. I left the Agency to attend a reception by the American Women in Radio and
                        Television for the new president, who is a <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss> employee. Upon leaving this reception, an Evening Star
                        reporter asked why I, as featured speaker, had arrived so late. I said a
                        major news story had tied me up . . . a Chicago Sun Times story relating to
                        possible intervention in the Middle East. I was asked if <persName
                            corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName> had been in Chicago all day, if he
                        had met with the Sun Times and if <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> was
                        playing the story worldwide. I said “yes” to all three. This accounts for
                        the coverage in today’s Star.</p>
                    <p>5. Upon returning home, I was shocked to learn that the wire services were
                        not playing the story. I called Ron Ziegler and discovered for the first
                        time that the President’s remarks (while accurately <pb facs="0322" n="270"
                            xml:id="pg_270"/> reported) were completely off-the-record and that the
                        Sun Times would play down the story in subsequent editions. <gloss
                            target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> was immediately instructed to do the same.
                        Fortunately, our worldwide Wireless File to the Embassies and our
                        instruction to press officers<note n="3" xml:id="d110fn3">Presumable
                            reference to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>–15396/<gloss

                        not yet gone out.</p>
                    <p>This incident, while not really serious, focuses attention on a point we have
                        discussed before. The international communications arm of this Government is
                        just not sufficiently informed to give anything but a fraction of the
                        support to our foreign policy of which it is capable. Worse, we are courting
                        mistakes which may some day be serious indeed. To let our international
                        media arms atrophy . . . as they may because insecurity of judgment leads to
                        a play-it-safe and do-nothing approach . . . would be tragic. To have a
                        situation in which we have not been present at any senior executive
                        discussion on the Mid East since the cease-fire began is unfathomable to me
                        in an age when communications is revolutionizing diplomacy.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d110fn4">An unknown hand underlined this sentence.</note></p>
                    <p>It is not enough to have occasional memos of instruction. Effective
                        communication is an orchestrated performance. Nuances . . . long term
                        strategy . . . and occasional very fast and deft actions . . . all play a
                        role. Continuing knowledge is an absolute prerequisite. We do not have it.
                        It is a mistake.</p>

                                asserted that he had done nothing “improper” regarding the <hi

                                    corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> continued: “The problem
                                in that episode was that it was not the product of a coordinated
                                plan. You knew as much about it as I did. I was back in Washington
                                at the time. The dilemma that emerged was between acquiescing in an
                                advantageous story and protecting the integrity of the
                                off-the-record ground rules.” (Ibid.) In his memoirs, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> wrote: “Though <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName> was contrite after the event,
                                I considered his statement on the whole helpful. When I was informed
                                of it by the head of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                                Information Agency, <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Frank
                                    Shakespeare</persName>, I told him that it gave me no pain. For
                                one thing, it would prove to our bureaucracy that my pressures for a
                                buildup in the Mediterranean reflected the President’s approach, not
                                my idiosyncrasy; indeed, it brought home to them that their real
                                choice was between systematic interagency planning and ad hoc
                                decisions in which they would not participate. Once I had convinced
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> that I had not
                                put <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName> up to it, the
                                incident led to a brief period of improved relations between us.”

                    <p>Meeting of the International Cultural Planning Task Force</p>
                    <p>Representatives of the Task Force, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>,
                        Smithsonian, National Endowment, Museum of Modern Art, <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>, and George Washington University met at
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCV_1">Carol Harford</persName>’s request on
                        October 6, to discuss the role of the U.S. in international art
                        festivals.</p>
                    <p>1. It was agreed that there should be a U.S. presence at such exhibitions,
                        even though this implies no commitment to U.S. participation in every
                        international show.</p>
                    <p>2. It was agreed that by participation in such shows the U.S. attempts to
                        reach and influence elites in the artistic and intellectual realms and
                        sometimes to satisfy needs that are not esthetic but political.</p>
                    <pb facs="0326" n="274" xml:id="pg_274"/>
                    <p>3. It was agreed that greater efforts ought to be made to seek private
                        sources of support for U.S. cultural presentations overseas. It was further
                        agreed that the effort to secure private financing should be coordinated so
                        that <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IAP_1">IAP</gloss> are not all
                        simultaneously trying to pluck the same goose.</p>
                    <p>4. It was agreed also that traveling art shows overseas frequently have more
                        impact and value for the U.S. than does participation in the great
                        well-known international shows.</p>
                    <p>I explained to this group, as I last week explained to the Smithsonian
                        people, that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> believes that the U.S.
                        government should maintain an international presence in the world of art and
                        that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> also believes that traveling
                        shows are exceedingly useful. I promised to discuss further with the
                        geographical areas possibilities for <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                        offered by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (which I
                        described to you on Monday).<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">October 5. The

                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> does not wish to present to the

                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> would have no objection to the

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AJP_1">Anderson</persName>: You no doubt have seen, as
                        others have, a lot of stories—some of them speculative and some of them
                        don’t seem to have the grains of truth that they ought to—that there is
                        developing a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> line or a <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> policy separate and distinct from the
                        State Department. Is there such?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName>: Well that’s a
                        complicated question. Firstly, and to make it very clear the policy of the
                        United States is set by the President of the United States and is
                        articulated by the State Department. That is the formal structure of the
                        foreign policy of the United States. Now the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> carries on a major information program throughout the
                        world which is structured to be in general support of foreign policy
                        interests of the people of this country. We very understandably may have
                        different points of emphasis than the formal diplomat would have, but that’s
                        only to say the obvious. That is to say that an information and
                        communications program is something different and newer than formal and
                        traditional diplomacy.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AJP_1">Anderson</persName>: Well how do you understand
                        then your relationship with the State Department? Is it as one executive
                        branch of the State Department or what?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName>: No. The United States
                        Information Agency was established by the Congress as an independent Agency.
                        We receive the money to run this Agency directly from the Congress of the

                        guidance from the State Department because we in this Agency do not set
                        policy; we implement it and try to support that policy, so that the officers
                        of our Agency and I myself meet frequently with the senior officers of the

                        Information Agency sent to its officers throughout the world a general

                        situation and the implication that we thought that it had. All of our
                        officers take those as a normal matter and use those as a basis for contact
                        with the press, television, radio, government people throughout the world
                        and that was true in this case.</p>
                    <pb facs="0329" n="277" xml:id="pg_277"/>
                    <p>JA: But it did not as I understand you then, it did not differ substantially
                        from what the State Department was saying at that time?</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_FS_1">FS</gloss>: Well it certainly didn’t differ in fact.
                        As I said, in many cases we differ in points of emphasis. Now let me give
                        you an illustration because this point, this matter of points of emphasis in
                        communication, is something I think that needs to be carefully understood.
                        Communications is a whole new force in diplomacy. It’s, in my opinion,
                        having a revolutionary effect on diplomacy. Now let me try to give you an
                        illustration. If in 1938 or in 1939 there had been a <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> (it did not exist at that time) the
                        State Department of the United States Government would have been having
                        formal diplomatic representations to Adolph Hitler and his government and
                        those would have been the official formal statements and papers with which
                        we are all familiar. They would have been couched in diplomatic language and
                        although they could have been and doubtless were fairly stern they were
                        basically formal representations between governments. A <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> at that point might very well have been
                        saying throughout the world “why are you putting Jews in the ovens?” Now
                        both of those were consistent with the facts. They both would have served
                        the objectives in making the world aware of what the Government of Nazi
                        Germany represented, but they would be different styles: the diplomatic
                        style, the formal diplomatic relationships between governments, and the
                        general communication of information throughout the world. Those are
                        different things.</p>
                    <p>JA: Then to take your thesis a step further, the actual presentation of it,
                        the medium, as it were, can sometimes be as important as the message then by
                        the emphasis, the technical emphasis, that the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> can give, it can then give substantial flavoring or
                        substantial emphasis to a foreign policy can it not?</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_FS_1">FS</gloss>: Yes very much so, and I think you’re
                        hitting right on it. Today, the attitude of people about an action of their
                        government or about an action of a foreign government can, in fact, be an
                        inhibiting factor in what the governments can make work or can do. To use
                        the most obvious illustrations, in the case of Southeast Asia, the case of
                        Viet-Nam, the attitude of the world people, indeed the attitude of many
                        citizens of the United States about the situation in Southeast Asia has had
                        an inhibiting force on, has reduced the options open to, the United States
                        Government. To take another case, the world’s passions are in many ways
                        intimately involved in what’s going on in the Middle East. Certainly world
                        Jewry is very concerned with Israel. The Arabs, 100,000,000 Arabs, highly
                        involved emotionally as well as rationally with what’s occurring in the
                        Middle East. Now those are psychological factors; those are human factors;
                        they’re not power factors, but they translate . . . with today’s rapid
                        communications, with today’s ability <pb facs="0330" n="278" xml:id="pg_278"
                        /> to reach people and to galvanize people, the attitude of people becomes
                        the factor. How do you, how do attitudes of people form? They form through
                        knowledge; and communications is the transmittal of knowledge.</p>

                            meeting and that the consensus “was that Recommendation 1—a need for
                            coordination of U.S. involvement in the international arts arena—should
                            be resolved first.” Hanford wrote that <persName corresp="#p_SM_1"
                                >Michael Straight</persName> (National Endowment for the Arts), upon
                            the request of the <gloss target="#t_ICPG_1">ICPG</gloss>, had agreed to
                            chair a working group “to look into specifics of current practices.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWK_1">Bunce</persName>, in an October 27
                            memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_LH_1">Loomis</persName>, referencing
                            the discussion of the recommendations that would take place that day,
                            stated: “We have some reservations about the recommendation that a
                            central government office coordinate U.S. arts representation abroad as
                            to policy, responsibility for representation and procedure, funding, and
                            role of a possible advisory council. Carol apparently does not have
                            fixed views as to where such a central office should be located—whether
                            in the White House, <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> or in <gloss
                                target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. If decisions of such an office
                            would involve funding and the office were outside of <gloss
                                target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, it might involve some complications
                            with regard to Agency funding priorities. On the whole, the memorandum
                            appears to provide a good basis for discussion by the International
                            Cultural Planning Group.” (Ibid.)</note></head>

                            xml:id="d115fn2">Attached but not printed is the undated list of Task
                            Force members.</note> of the International Cultural Planning Group Task
                        Force on U.S. representation in the arts abroad are reflected in the
                        following recommendations of the 12 persons who represented private and
                        Government interests in the visual and performing arts.</p>
                    <p>The Members agreed that it is important for the U.S. to be among the
                        participating nations at international cultural events abroad, and that form
                        and scope of representation must be responsive to the individual event or
                        the country in which representation will occur. It also became evident that
                        existing programs should be reviewed.</p>
                    <p>Interwoven among the broader precepts and more specific problems, was an
                        attempt to determine the appropriate role of Government—coordinator,
                        catalyst or source? The consensus seemed to be the former.</p>
                    <p>While the combined resources of Government agencies most directly involved
                        with this facet of representation abroad (State, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_NCFA_1">NCFA</gloss>/<gloss
                            target="#t_IAP_1">IAP</gloss>) are probably considerably less than $2
                        million, the value is significant. Though relatively miniscule, the funding
                        is significant also. Particularly now, as related to the International Art
                        Program <pb facs="0332" n="280" xml:id="pg_280"/> of the Smithsonian, which
                        comes under the direct jurisdiction of the National Collection of Fine Arts.
                        Budgetary demands upon the <gloss target="#t_NCFA_1">NCFA</gloss> for its
                        domestic programs seems to call for a review now of <gloss target="#t_IAP_1"
                            >IAP</gloss> policies and procedures. What seems to be needed is
                        re-assessment of <gloss target="#t_IAP_1">IAP</gloss>’s current status
                        within <gloss target="#t_NCFA_1">NCFA</gloss> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >possible</hi> consideration of another base for its operations. While
                        the program must continue its commitment to international representation
                        (i.e., the exchange of fine arts exhibits as well as U.S. participation in
                        Venice and Sao Paulo Biennials and similar international events—as specified
                        in the Memorandum of Understanding between <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> and the Smithsonian Institution) of American activity in
                        the visual arts, budgetary adjustments may call for shifting the major
                        fiscal burden for specific exhibitions.</p>
                    <p>I. There is a need for coordination of U.S. involvement in the international
                        arts arena. This is necessary from the standpoint of policy determination
                        and because representatives of Government agencies find there is overlap in
                        approaching private sources for funds, which are becoming more difficult to
                        get.</p>
                    <p>Coordination could help to make budgets, impacts and effect go further
                        thereby, hopefully, creating fuller, richer programs for foreign
                        audiences.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi> That a central Government office
                        coordinate U.S. arts representation abroad as to policy (where, when and
                        what form) responsibility for representation (which agency) and procedure
                        (selection of work, funding, role of possible advisory council).</p>
                    <p>II. Government endorsement is essential and a little “seed” money is helpful
                        to increasing coordination between private and public interests in support
                        of a joint venture in the arts.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi> That the President meet with selected
                        representatives of industry to ask their support to increase U.S. cultural
                        representation abroad.</p>
                    <p>III. There was discussion within the group, as there apparently has been in
                        international arts groups meetings, of considering festivals of mixed
                        cultural media. Whereas this type of festival takes place in other
                        countries, to the knowledge of members of this group, none such has taken
                        place in the United States.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi> That consideration be given to the
                        feasibility of the United States hosting an international festival of mixed
                        cultural media.</p>
                    <p>That consideration be given to the feasibility of U.S. representatives
                        encouraging more of this type of international festival abroad.</p>
                    <p>IV. The role of U.S. representation in the visual arts has been directed
                        fairly consistently to entries in major international exhibitions, with
                        smaller exhibitions being sent as well.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi> That emphasis be placed on increasing
                        the number of smaller exhibits circulated abroad, and the policy of entry
                        into major international exhibitions be re-examined from the standpoints of
                        support and cultural and diplomatic usefulness.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Youth, Change, and Foreign Policy</p>
                    <p>I would like to talk to you today about a factor in the conduct of foreign
                        affairs that we are taking into greater account in our operations both in
                        the Department of State and in our missions around the world.</p>
                    <p>That factor is the present or potential power of students and youth, here and
                        abroad, and their role as generators and reflectors of social and political
                        change. Here, at a conference of voluntary agencies to which young people
                        have been particularly invited, it is appropriate to consider that impact
                        and how we are incorporating it into the planning of our foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>Around the globe a wave of activism on the part of young people has unsettled
                        political developments in country after country. At its crest in 1968 youth
                        sparked major outbreaks in more than 30 countries. That this broad movement
                        surprised most governments and most foreign offices has been a spur to
                        closer attention to the views and activities of younger people.</p>
                    <p>The significance for policymakers does not, however, rest only in the
                        immediate effect of these eruptions on governments in being. Significance
                        also resides in what lies behind them.</p>
                    <p>Today’s youth are the product of fundamental changes that have swept the
                        world in the quarter century since World War II. An age of science and
                        technology, of exploding population, of instant communication, of rising
                        demands for higher standards of life, has produced a cultural revolution and
                        with it a political ferment.</p>
                    <p>Everywhere—more than when we were young—youth are questioning, challenging,
                        and doubting—everything.</p>
                    <p>Both here and abroad, many young people are approaching national and world
                        issues, ideologies and priorities, institutions and authority, in a
                        substantially different way from that of the generation that preceded
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Many also are not, but clearly something new is going on, something
                        significant, something that forces us to focus on the nature of our era.</p>
                    <pb facs="0334" n="282" xml:id="pg_282"/>
                    <p>We must seek first to understand what is happening. Then we must ask what are
                        its implications.</p>
                    <p>That today’s youth represent a new kind of generation is hardly to be
                        wondered at.</p>
                    <p>—Well over half of the world’s expanding population has been born since World
                        War II; that is, they are under 25. They have no direct knowledge of that
                        war, no direct knowledge of the Korean war, no direct knowledge of the more
                        dangerous periods of the cold war.</p>
                    <p>—More and more of these young people are better and better educated. Across
                        the world rapid gains have been made in primary and secondary education and
                        in eliminating illiteracy. The 11 million who were in universities or other
                        schools of higher education in 1960 had swelled just 5 years later by 60
                        percent, to 18 million. In the United States the number doubled between 1960
                        and 1969. Better informed, better educated, they are more conscious socially
                        and politically as well.</p>
                    <p>—And those who enter university stay there much longer than formerly. They
                        have to. The knowledge they need in order to cope in this technological age
                        has exploded. So at a time when young people are apparently maturing
                        physically earlier than before, their active participation in society is
                        postponed. Added to this, in developed countries, is a new affluence,
                        releasing many students from the economic cares that kept their parent’s
                        generation preoccupied.</p>
                    <p>—Everywhere, also, modern communications are making young people vividly
                        aware of their world, and ours, and of how others elsewhere are reacting to
                        it. Tantalizing, broadening, stimulating, disillusioning word comes early
                        and graphically, prepackaged and instantly transmitted. Instead of making
                        society uniform, as most of us once expected, this vast flow of information
                        has encouraged the formation of subcultures such as that of “youth” and has
                        done so without regard to national or ideological lines.</p>
                    <p>—The rush to the cities characteristic of the age is creating its own
                        influences. All over the world, people are discarding the old traditions and
                        the old restraints of village or town to seek new opportunities in an urban
                        setting. There they form a critical mass, swollen in numbers, newly free to
                        question and to probe. There their children pass formative years amid vastly
                        new and untraditional influences.</p>
                    <p>—And in much of the world the exhilaration of newly found independence has
                        come face to face with the hard realities of underdevelopment, producing at
                        one time progress, hope, frustration, and despair.</p>
                    <p>Who can wonder that youth formed under the pressure of these circumstances
                        see the world in a different light?</p>
                    <p>Some believe that the youth phenomenon will pass, that youth will settle into
                        “normalcy.” No doubt this will be so in societies, such as <pb facs="0335"
                            n="283" xml:id="pg_283"/> our own, with healthy economies and
                        established means of popular change; no doubt so if we mean that the
                        outrages of violence must be ended and that the appeals of extremist
                        ideology will abate; no doubt so if “normalcy” includes the process of
                        peaceful change. But in other circumstances the phenomenon is likely to
                        persist, and everywhere the factors that brought the phenomenon into being
                        are far from disappearing.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Impact of Youth Upon Developments Abroad</p>
                    <p>Those of us who are responsible for the country’s foreign affairs must face
                        the implications of this phenomenon both abroad and at home. Let us look at
                        foreign matters first.</p>
                    <p>For a number of years the Department of State has recognized that foreign
                        policy must take into account the substantial impact of young
                        people—radical, liberal, moderate, conservative, or reactionary—upon
                        developments abroad.</p>
                    <p>In many countries youth have commanded our attention as a political factor
                        now.</p>
                    <p>Youth abroad also bear on U.S. long-term foreign relations. They may be said,
                        for instance, to provide a “distant early warning” of the problems of a
                        society and the directions it might take. They carry with them a core of
                        attitudes and values that will influence, though with modification of
                        perspective and greater nuance, the decades to come. From them, though not
                        necessarily nor even probably from those who loom largest for the moment,
                        inevitably must come the leadership of tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Exactly what may be the long-range influence of current youth unrest is
                        necessarily speculative, as all future estimates must be. But what is clear
                        is this: No Embassy effort at political analysis is complete unless it takes
                        into account the shifts in values, norms, and beliefs and the actual
                        political impact of the various and often divergent forces of a politically
                        aware generation.</p>
                    <p>Since 1962 the Government has sought to assure attention to such developments
                        through an Inter-Agency Youth Committee and through the stimulus of a
                        special Youth Adviser responsible to the Secretary of State. Programs of
                        Government agencies with foreign young people—especially in the Defense
                        Department, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, and <gloss
                            target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>—have been operated under general
                        coordination through the Committee. And our Embassies have been encouraged
                        by the Committee to observe and report on youth developments, just as they
                        do on commercial, labor, political, economic, or other matters.</p>
                    <p>After assuming office in 1969, Secretary of State <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> decided that a new impetus needed
                        to be given to Department and Embassy <pb facs="0336" n="284"
                            xml:id="pg_284"/> efforts to take account of continued youth activities
                        around the world.<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">See <ref target="#d67fn2"
                                >footnote 2, Document 67</ref>.</note> He instructed all American
                        Ambassadors abroad to reexamine the priority they were giving to this aspect
                        of their work. They were requested to assure that their Embassies were
                        according not special weight but realistic weight to the new political
                        impact of youth on society, to the societal changes youth were reflecting,
                        and to the changes they were generating. They were asked to take advantage
                        of the interests and energies of younger Embassy officers by giving them
                        opportunities to develop such work. And they were asked to examine their use
                        of available funds for exchanges, assistance, and other purposes to insure
                        that youth factors were being taken into account.</p>
                    <p>To reinforce the point the Youth Adviser was sent to regional meetings of
                        American Ambassadors throughout the world. He found our Ambassadors
                        receptive, prepared to cooperate, and in many cases more conscious than the
                        Department of the youthfulness of particular societies (17 heads of states
                        or government are 40 or under). Systematic incorporation of youth
                        developments is now an established part of the political and economic
                        analysis of most Embassies.</p>
                    <p>Conveying an undistorted understanding of American life and of American
                        objectives to those who will be the carriers of new values and new attitudes
                        is also of importance to our long-term foreign policy objectives. So also is
                        the contribution we are uniquely able to make to young people in
                        underdeveloped countries in acquiring the skills and knowledge necessary for
                        economic and social progress in a modern world. Government-wide programs
                        involving exchange activities, the principal means through which we seek
                        these objectives, reach the surprisingly large figure of $400 million.</p>
                    <p>Two such programs are operated directly by the State Department—one by the
                        Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and one by the Agency for
                        International Development. Together they bring some 7,000 people to the
                        United States annually, about half of whom are under 30. I am pleased to say
                        that several years of budget cuts in the educational and cultural programs
                        were reversed last year under the new Assistant Secretary, <persName
                            corresp="#p_RJ_1">John Richardson</persName>, when we received a $5
                        million increase.</p>
                    <p>We must recognize, of course, that of 130,000 foreign university students in
                        the United States, 90 percent are here without U.S. Government sponsorship,
                        support, or scarcely encouragement. It may well be that there is more we
                        could do to help contribute to the success of their sojourn in the United
                        States.</p>
                    <pb facs="0337" n="285" xml:id="pg_285"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Greater Exchange With American Young People</p>
                    <p>If our custody of America’s welfare abroad includes a responsibility to
                        comprehend the impact of foreign youth on American interests, so also do we
                        have a responsibility to consider the views of American young people in
                        determining what those interests are.</p>
                    <p>I do not mean to suggest that American youth stand as a monolithic force
                        presenting a single view. The spectrum is broad, the political persuasions
                        varied. In large measure we do not even accurately know the balance of their
                        views. And it is too early to tell what trends will be lasting. But running
                        through all and affecting all are the currents of the times. New forces are
                        stirring all youth, and the drive to make their views heard is
                        compelling.</p>
                    <p>One need not concur in these views to conclude that they should be given a
                        hearing. At a time when American foreign policy is shifting from
                        preoccupation with the problems bestowed on the world by World War II toward
                        preoccupation with the opportunities of the last quarter of the 20th
                        century, a readjustment of our role and involvement abroad has indeed become
                        both desirable and necessary. That adjustment has been set underway by the
                        President. It embraces a continued involvement, a continued expression of
                        leadership, and a continued concern for our security; but it does so in the
                        context of greater responsibility by others and in the conviction that no
                        nation should play too predominant a role.</p>
                    <p>In any case youth’s active participation in the conduct of public affairs is
                        to be vigorously encouraged. The opening of our councils to the best that
                        American youth today offer will give us the advantage of new conceptions of
                        our problems and an opportunity to engage in a fruitful exchange of views
                        where perspectives or conclusions differ.</p>
                    <p>In his first statement to the Department after assuming office Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> stated that he hoped to
                        lead a “receptive and open establishment where men speak their minds and are
                        listened to on merit, and where divergent views are fully and promptly
                        passed on for decision.”<note n="3" xml:id="d116fn3">For text, see Bulletin
                            of Feb. 10, 1969, p. 125. [Footnote is in the original. See
                            ibid.]</note> And he called upon senior officers to encourage the
                        participation of our young people. That statement was directed to the
                        stimulation of young people within the Department, but it applies as well to
                        the greater exchange which the Department desires with American young
                        people.</p>
                    <p>On both sides there is much to gain from an increased dialogue.</p>
                    <p>We in Government will have to avoid a temptation to think we have
                        “communicated” with youth simply when we have informed <pb facs="0338"
                            n="286" xml:id="pg_286"/> them of the details of our policies. We will
                        have to be ready to face and deal not only with specific discussions of
                        specific policies but also with fundamental challenges to values and
                        assumptions. We will have not just to listen but really to hear.</p>
                    <p>So on their side will youth have to show their own readiness to listen, to
                        deal with facts, and to consider the complexities and specifications of
                        decisionmaking as it actually happens.</p>
                    <p>Among us all there will have to be an effort to talk with, not at, each
                        other.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">New Measures and New Approaches</p>
                    <p>To find effective ways to open policymaking mechanisms to these prospects is
                        an important task. We have already taken a number of steps.</p>
                    <p>An essential move was to release creative energies in the Department itself.
                        To do this we have taken measures such as these:</p>
                    <p>—Expanded use has been encouraged by the Department’s senior officers of what
                        is known as the Open Forum Panel, an opportunity for junior Foreign Service
                        officers—almost all still in their twenties or early thirties—to convey to
                        the very top of the Department considered views on policy they wish to
                        transmit outside the constraints of bureaucratic channels. They have done so
                        and have utilized the means not only to suggest changes in existing or
                        proposed policies but even, happily, to reinforce policies already underway
                        in which they saw special merit. Two of the Department-wide task forces
                        created to review our entire management and policy structure were charged
                        with mandates to develop greater “creativity” as well as greater “openness”
                        within the Department.<note n="4" xml:id="d116fn4">Following an address

                    <p>—Each of our Bureaus was asked to make efforts to include young people in the
                        advisory panels they customarily use to bring into the Department informed
                        views from the academic, business, and other communities.</p>
                    <p>—And participation of American youth has been emphasized in the many
                        multilateral organizations of which we are members. Our delegation to the
                        current U.N. General Assembly, for example, includes <pb facs="0339" n="287"
                            xml:id="pg_287"/> a member who, at 30, is the youngest American delegate
                        ever appointed and, for the first time, three young people under 25 serving
                        as youth advisers.</p>
                    <p>No amount of openness within the Department, however, can substitute for the
                        intellectual stimulation that comes from give-and-take between the
                        Department and the world of the academics, voluntary agencies, and foreign
                        affairs. Here also we are trying new approaches.</p>
                    <p>When the new Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, <persName
                            corresp="#p_CM_2">Michael Collins</persName>, was appointed in January
                        he was given a mandate by the Secretary to place special emphasis upon
                        improving our relations with the public, “particularly the young people.”
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Collins</persName> responded to that mandate
                        with the appointment of a new youth adviser in his Bureau assigned full time
                        to deal with American youth and by the initiation of a comprehensive youth
                        participation program.</p>
                    <p>—One aspect, a program to permit young professors to work for a full week
                        side by side and issue by issue with officers in the Department related to
                        their own specialty, was begun early in the year. Thirteen young African
                        experts from as many campuses started the program, followed by groups on the
                        Near East, South Asia, Latin America, and Europe. Seven more such groups of
                        professors will have a chance to exchange views with our officers between
                        now and next spring, this time in functional as well as geographical
                        areas.</p>
                    <p>—Another aspect, to intensify efforts to get State Department officers,
                        especially young ones, into contact with young people in their own setting,
                        began this fall. Visits to at least 600 campuses are planned during the
                        year, most of which will avoid the customary lecture pattern in preference
                        to small group discussions.</p>
                    <p>—A doubling within the year of the number of young people who routinely have
                        access to the Department for substantive discussions has been made a third
                        objective, exemplified for instance, by the 200 students we expect to
                        receive in January for weeklong seminars with Foreign Service officers.</p>
                    <p>—To reach still others a new program of radio and <gloss target="#t_TV_1"
                            >TV</gloss> discussions on the issues and major assumptions underlying
                        foreign policy among youth and Foreign Service officers is also under
                        preparation.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile we are continuing the placement of Foreign Service officers in
                        universities for full academic periods—not only to advance their skills and
                        learning but to expose them to the currents of thought that find expression
                        on campus and to help convey to the campuses some of our knowledge and
                        considerations. Forty-eight <gloss target="#t_FSO_1">FSO</gloss>’s are
                        currently pursuing college courses across America and six high-level
                        officers are located in universities as “diplomats-in-residence,” visiting
                        professors, in effect, from the world of practice.</p>
                    <pb facs="0340" n="288" xml:id="pg_288"/>
                    <p>These many steps we have already taken may not be well known. But we do want
                        it to be well known that we are committed to maintaining open channels of
                        communication with the forces of youth here and abroad.</p>
                    <p>We believe that from our Embassies’ efforts abroad will come a surer sense of
                        the tendencies of other societies. And we believe that from our efforts at
                        home should come sounder foundations for future policymaking and bridges to
                        a future governed by new conditions.</p>
                    <p>Young people, it must be remembered, are more than just another interest
                        group. They are the members of all the interest groups of the future. And
                        the best of them are already concerned not just for their own well-being of
                        today but for that of the whole society of tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Often those of us in Government may not be able to do, and often we should
                        not do, what many of the most articulate youth are asking. But we should and
                        we will add their advice, their perceptions, and their interests to those of
                        traditional claimants in the formulation of a foreign policy in the service
                        of our country.</p>

                        Audiences</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Problem</p>
                    <p>Foreign audiences today receive a great volume of information from and about
                        the United States, but they often do not receive a full and fair picture of
                        the American scene. There are many reasons for this.</p>
                    <pb facs="0341" n="289" xml:id="pg_289"/>
                    <p>Information flow is fragmentary. Messages compete for time and attention.
                        Media, particularly television, assault the senses as much as they appeal to
                        the intellect. The result is, consciously or unconsciously, to put a premium
                        on the transmission of the sensational and on visceral audience
                        response.</p>
                    <p>All around the world the United States is in the news. More often than not
                        the United States makes international news as a principal protagonist in Big
                        Power conflicts. While playing this role confers certain benefits on the
                        United States, it tends to militate against appreciation of the complexity
                        of American society and in favor of a simplistic and superficial view of
                        American actions and motivations.</p>
                    <p>The productivity of Americans has made a mixed contribution to the national
                        image, evoking both admiration and envy, and occasioning both gratitude and
                        resentment among those dependent on American wealth. Our free institutions
                        which have made such a large contribution to our productivity are admired,
                        but at the same time non-Americans who feel they cannot “afford” freedom in
                        their nations wonder if there is enough discipline in American life. People
                        in developing countries in the 1970’s may well feel increasing estrangement
                        from American experience and may view American developments in a prejudiced
                        way because they are alien to their own vital concerns.</p>
                    <p>The United States’ “image problem” is compounded by the fact that, since the
                        century of European exploration, much of the world has had higher hopes for
                        America than for the older lands. Poor conditions of life in countries which
                        are our chief rivals in power and influence often are overlooked, while
                        exposure of the faults in American society gets notice and causes
                        disappointment.</p>
                    <p>During the past five years Americans, themselves, have probably been the
                        chief witnesses against America. Some of the most articulate individuals and
                        institutions in the United States have expressed opposition to American
                        policies and have questioned the validity of the organization and quality of
                        American life. With America so much in the world news and with the great
                        reach and penetration of the international media, internal debate in the
                        United States has a worldwide audience, which includes parties determined to
                        exploit the debate for their own, anti-American purposes.</p>
                    <p>Solving the problem is beyond the capability of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>. Indeed, there are good reasons for our deriving comfort
                        from the existence of some aspects of the “problem.” The present paper
                        suggests treatment and themes which may enable media and posts to focus
                        attention on the positive aspects of American life and thereby to increase
                        respect for the United States.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Guidelines for Treatment of American Domestic
                        Developments</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Let the world know what America stands for</hi>. The
                        measure of American institutions is the degree of liberty they confer and
                        their responsive<pb facs="0342" n="290" xml:id="pg_290"/>ness to the wants
                        and needs of the citizens, freely expressed. Our particular institutions are
                        peculiar to us. We have no desire and no right to confer them on other
                        peoples. But the principles of free choice and popular participation in
                        peaceful change which underlie the institutions of American life have
                        universal appeal. It is not difficult to make a strong and positive
                        identification of the United States with these principles; it is impossible
                        for communist nations to do the same.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Show confidence in the United States</hi>. The United
                        States approaches its bicentennial, having prevailed over crises of epic
                        proportions. “Government of the people, by the people, for the people” still
                        flourishes. The American people have demonstrated the capacity to remain
                        faithful to the ideals of the founding fathers and simultaneously to adapt
                        to greatly changed circumstances of life.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Place our materialism in context</hi>. Men everywhere
                        want a decent life. A lack of at least a minimum of material things detracts
                        from human dignity. The American system has provided the minimum for almost
                        all Americans and has given vast numbers the opportunity to achieve much
                        more. We do not flaunt our material accomplishments; and it is not <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s role to export American goods and
                        technical advice. Our responsibilities are to illuminate the working of the
                        American institutions which account for productivity and the equitable
                        distribution of the product of labor and to show that American civilization
                        is more than merely materialistic.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Be selective in output</hi>. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> is engaged in advocacy. Today’s world is so full of
                        communication and noise that only if we focus our message can we hope our
                        audiences will focus their attention on what we have to say. We must know
                        what else is being said about America, so we can select purposefully and be
                        effective advocates.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Repeat, reinforce, recapitulate</hi>. Facts presented in
                        isolation have far less impact than facts ordered explicitly and
                        consecutively to support a well-defined theme. As additional facts are
                        presented, restate the theme they support.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Be relevant to our audiences</hi>. Talk in terms of,
                        “Everyone has problems. We sympathize with yours. We’ve had similar
                        problems, and this is what we’re trying to do about them—which might
                        possibly be of interest to you.” Where our problem-solving has borrowed from
                        foreign experience, express gratitude for the help. Where our experience has
                        been irrevelant, don’t parade it. Where we can’t help, listen; that may be
                        help enough.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Show the United States on the frontiers of modern man’s
                            experience</hi>. Our size, our resources, our universal interests and
                        our free institutions usually expose Americans sooner and more fully than
                        others to the problems of modern life. Our present is likely to be their
                        future. However, our aim is not to direct our audiences’ attention to their
                        future <pb facs="0343" n="291" xml:id="pg_291"/> problems (they are too busy
                        now to worry about tomorrow’s troubles); rather, our goal is to demonstrate
                        that the United States is capable of dealing with the challenges to society
                        in America, and in the process, that Americans are accumulating experience
                        which may be of benefit and which is made available to all mankind.</p>
                    <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Do not advertize our problems</hi>. When and if our
                        problems come to the attention of foreign publics, in a manner and to a
                        degree that is harmful to our national interests, we should supply
                        additional facts and explanations to gain understanding of our difficulties
                        and recognition that we are overcoming them. But there is no reason for
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> posts to initiate discussion of American problems where
                        concern with them is insignificant.</p>

                        participation in fairs and exhibitions abroad (copy attached),<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d118fn2">Not attached.</note> the Under Secretaries Committee
                        has concluded that the United States is suffering political disadvantages
                        because of both a lack of participation and poor-quality representation in a
                        number of foreign exhibi<pb facs="0344" n="292" xml:id="pg_292"/>tions which
                        do not meet the present criteria for U.S. Government involvement.</p>
                    <p>The problem has arisen largely as a result of changes in the priorities of
                        the two principal agencies in the exhibition field. Department of Commerce
                        exhibitions have become wholly “hard-sell” commercial operations staged
                        primarily in Western Europe and Japan. Budget cuts have seriously limited
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> participation in international
                        fairs; that agency has in fact been forced to concentrate its efforts in
                        Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>A survey of U.S. missions reveals that there are currently some twenty annual
                        or biennial events outside Eastern Europe for which U.S. participation has
                        been solicited primarily for political reasons. The city locations are:</p>

                    <p>In many instances, e.g., Izmir and Thessaloniki, the United States is
                        expected to be a major participant. U.S. absence is viewed with indignation
                        as a politically-motivated sign of lack of interest. Local government and
                        U.S. Embassy pressures have on a number of occasions persuaded the U.S. to
                        make last minute decisions to participate without adequate resources or time
                        to stage a creditable exhibit.</p>
                    <p>An avowed policy of not participating in non-commercial exhibits outside of
                        Eastern Europe is unduly restrictive and unrealistic. As in the past, the
                        pressures for U.S. participation in a certain number of exhibitions will
                        continue to be applied by officials of the sponsoring countries. A planned
                        program would accommodate most situations where political considerations are
                        paramount and eliminate the present unsatisfactory makeshift and
                        crash-planning procedures which are not conducive to either proper
                        selectivity or effective participation.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretaries Committee therefore recommends an orderly participation
                        in selected exhibitions, based on alternative No. 3 as described on p. 11 in
                        the attached Interagency Exhibits Committee report. This would provide
                        limited scale participation, making use wherever possible of reusable,
                        transportable exhibits. The above-men<pb facs="0345" n="293" xml:id="pg_293"
                        />tioned cities constitute only a suggested list from which exhibition sites
                        could be selected. The plan, to be implemented by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> under State Department policy guidance, would call for an
                        increase in Special International Exhibition (<gloss target="#t_SIE_1"
                            >SIE</gloss>) funding in the order of one and one-half million dollars
                        annually.</p>

                        special fund of approximately one and one-half million dollars annually.
                        This fund would be used to mount modest exhibits in those areas where the
                        U.S. presence is deemed by the Department of State to be in the best
                        interests of U.S. foreign policy.<note n="3" xml:id="d118fn3">The President

                            “has decided that the request for a special fund of $1.5 million for

                            should be handled through the usual budget process.” Under a January 13

                        creating problems as far as his being informed and, therefore, projecting an

                        to be better informed on what we are thinking. I can partly imagine that
                        this is at least part reaction to his losing his seat when the Review Group

                            leadership in other countries, (2) the building of a broad continuing
                            relationship, both public and private, with these leadership structures,
                            and (3) contributions toward leadership development in other countries.
                            In this study, particular emphasis and attention should be given to
                            developing nations.</p>
                        <p>The study should:</p>
                        <quote><p>—Review the extent and nature of U.S. Government, private sector

                                science, business, law, journalism and social science) including the
                                military and also foreign students in the U.S. The review should

                                problems in program implementation. The review should also identify

                            <p>—Consider steps which might be initiated with regard to U.S. programs
                                affecting the developing nations (primarily in the Middle East,
                                Latin America, Asia and Africa), but not excluding the Eastern
                                European countries and countries such as Spain and Portugal, to
                                assure access to key leadership points in these societies, to
                                coordinate government efforts in exchanges, and to stimulate and
                                guide the private sector programs. Proposed alternative steps
                                designed to achieve these goals—whether involving new programs,
                                modification or improvement of existing programs, or the discarding
                                of programs—should be accompanied by a discussion of the relevant
                                advantages and disadvantages.</p>
                            <p>—Consider the relationship between U.S. Government and private sector

                                U.S.-sponsored and non-sponsored students. The study should present
                                the range of objectives that should govern U.S. Government contact
                                with the students and also options regarding the levels, types and
                                loci within the Government of programs to achieve these

                            should be utilized to the extent possible to facilitate arrangements and

                        modernization, and development (and all synonyms for these terms) as
                        objectives for <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts. In Africa and
                        Latin America there traditionally has been no other objective. In our Area
                        modernization-nation building has been a central objective for several
                        posts. So where do we stand now? Why hasn’t the Agency given the posts
                        official guidance? Isn’t there a legitimate connection between this
                        objective and so much of the work which we have done recently in Laos,
                        Viet-Nam, and Thailand? Furthermore, when we assist in nation building,
                        aren’t we combating the potential enemies of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                            >USG</gloss>?</p>
                    <p>These are real questions, for I have heard many of you state them. I really
                        have no better answers than I did in <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>
                        Letter No. 16,<note n="3" xml:id="d121fn3">Not found.</note> in which I
                        touched on this subject. What I do have is the attached memorandum which
                            <persName corresp="#p_WBM_1">Barbara White</persName> wrote after
                        sitting in on a discussion between the Director and <persName

                        America. Bob argued, in effect, that he was out of business in Latin America
                        if nation building was judged to be out of bounds. The answer to this
                        argument is set forth in Barbara’s memo.</p>
                    <p>I believe and have argued that we would all be much better off if we could
                        get an official <gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> guidance paper to the

                        <p>In connection with questions by <persName corresp="#p_ARC_1">Bob
                                Amerson</persName> about <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s
                            role in national development in Latin America, the Director made the
                            following points:</p>
                        <p>1) We do not question U.S. policy to support national development in
                            Latin America, but as a specialized agency <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                                >USIA</gloss> has a special role and special priorities.</p>
                        <p>2) The primary objectives to which <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            should contribute are keeping the countries of Latin America (a) free
                            and (b) on the side of the United States.</p>
                        <p>3) We should make a special point of informing the elites of how freedom
                            can slip away—salami tactics of how communists take over a free
                            government.</p>
                        <p>4) <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has a special capability to
                            explain the necessary ingredients of a free, modern society, among them
                            (a) freedom of information, (b) private enterprise.</p>
                        <pb facs="0354" n="302" xml:id="pg_302"/>
                        <p>5) Population control is a U.S. objective and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                                >USIA</gloss> may contribute toward it in certain circumstances. The
                            decisions, to be made country by country, depends on the judgment of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>, whether it is feasible and
                            desirable for us, as the information service of a foreign government, to
                            do so in this highly sensitive field. It also becomes a question of
                            relative priorities with the other demands on <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                                >USIA</gloss> resources.</p>
                        <p>6) He expressed some doubt regarding how much <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                                >USIA</gloss> should try to promote democracy, U.S. style. He liked
                            the wording of the IAL objective in its Area Program Memorandum:
                            “Stimulating awareness among Latin governments of the need to be
                            reasonably responsive to the needs and desires of their citizenry,
                            whether or not the government is representative in a formal sense.” In
                            other words, we should try to promote the principles of a free society,
                            but recognize that different solutions will be applicable to different
                            countries. He asked Bob to look into whether more should be done in
                            Latin America in publicizing the Mexican experience.</p>
                        <p>7) He does not give a very high priority to gaining support for U.S.
                            policies in other areas (e.g., Middle East, Viet-Nam). In general this
                            is of lesser importance.</p>
                        <p>8) The four priority countries in Latin America (both for resources and
                            for calibre of personnel) should be Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and
                            Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>The discussion centered on the specific objectives listed in IAL’s Area
                            Program Memorandum. The fifth should be rewritten to state the political
                            goal, e.g. development of a viable free society. Modernization is not an
                            end in itself; our activities should support it only when there is a
                            clearly defined political or ideological objective.</p>

                            Ashe</persName> in your office in October—a fact widely reported in

                        tour to your initiation and desire for strengthening relations.</p>
                    <p>In 18 days of daily tennis exhibitions and coaching clinics with young

                        Zambia, Uganda, Nigeria and Ghana produced the following results:</p>

                        and students, watched the tennis exhibitions. Another 3,000 students were
                        given personal coaching. Television interviews with <persName

                    <p>While the natural, harmonious partnership of the white and black American

                        Negro to make the big time in a stronghold of white players,” a recurrent
                        theme. Similarly, there was highly favorable reaction everywhere to
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Ashe</persName>’s statements on apartheid in
                        South Africa. As a result, our Embassies report meaningful local effects and
                        increased rapport between Embassies and local groups.</p>

                    <p>All Embassies connected with the tour have reflected the following evaluation
                        from Embassy Nigeria: “Few cultural exchange programs here in recent years
                        can match the success of the <persName corresp="#p_AA_1"

                        of more athletes of this caliber in the cultural exchange program to

                    <p>There’s a revolution going on in the attitudes and values of the world’s
                        young people. Among other things, the world’s youth are becoming
                        increasingly leftist and anti-American. This has the most serious
                        implications for American foreign policy and for <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>, but, <pb facs="0360" n="308" xml:id="pg_308"/>
                        unfortunately, the youth phenomenon is widely misunderstood within the
                        foreign affairs establishment.</p>
                    <p>What are the causes of this revolution? Where is it going? What, if anything,
                        can we do about it? In seeking answers to these questions, we can start with
                        last summer’s World Youth Assembly—a microcosm of the world youth scene.</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">BACKGROUND</hi></p>
                    <p>The first World Youth Assembly met under United Nations auspices in New York,
                        July 9–17, 1970. The general tenor of the meeting was expressed in the
                            <gloss target="#t_WYA_1">WYA</gloss>’s “Message to the General Assembly
                        of the United Nations.” Among other things, it called for:</p>
                    <p>—“ending under-development, hunger, misery, racism and illiteracy to assure
                        the free development of each country;”</p>
                    <p>—“the immediate cessation of American aggression against the Indo-Chinese
                        peoples;”</p>
                    <p>—“the Soviet Union to immediately withdraw its occupying forces from
                        Czechoslovakia, and to restore full democracy to that country;”</p>
                    <p>—“an end to any system of neo-colonialist exploitation;”</p>
                    <p>—“a repudiation of “the bloc politics of the Great Powers;”</p>
                    <p>—“non-interference in the affairs of other countries;”</p>
                    <p>Many generalizations may be drawn from the <gloss target="#t_WYA_1"
                            >WYA</gloss>. Among them:</p>
                    <p>—youth is increasingly impatient for rapid social, political and economic
                        change;</p>
                    <p>—more and more educated young people are becoming radical leftists;</p>
                    <p>—U.S. policies are widely opposed; many are hostile to the U.S.;</p>
                    <p>—America is seen as a <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>, imperialistic
                        nation;</p>
                    <p>—suspicion of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is common;</p>
                    <p>—a Third World orientation is gaining ground;</p>
                    <p>—capitalism has few friends;</p>
                    <p>—a more responsive, humane form of democratic socialism is being sought by
                        youth of industrialized nations;</p>
                    <p>—Third World youth is more and more disenchanted with political democracy,
                        tending to favor some form of left-wing dictatorship;</p>
                    <p>—Marxism is youth’s prevalent language;</p>
                    <p>—youth from under-developed areas are intensely nationalistic;</p>
                    <p>—internationalism is becoming popular among youth in developed nations.</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">WAS IT REPRESENTATIVE</hi>?</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_WYA_1">WYA</gloss> is indicative of a clear and growing
                        trend among the politically-aware members of the world’s youth.</p>
                    <pb facs="0361" n="309" xml:id="pg_309"/>
                    <p>It may be argued that students were over-represented at the <gloss
                            target="#t_WYA_1">WYA</gloss>. But students are the most important
                        sector of world youth. Ex-students are “over-represented” in almost all the
                        institutions that matter—Government, business, universities, etc. As
                        knowledge becomes more crucial to national development, students will be
                        even more over-represented in the future.</p>
                    <p>It may be argued that the activists are not typical of youth in general. They
                        are atypical only in that they are more committed and more sophisticated.
                        Their attitudes, while often more extreme, are broadly reflective of the
                        thinking of politically-aware young people. The militants’ opinions are not
                        developed in isolation. They stem from the psychological orientation of
                        their generation.</p>
                    <p>It may be argued that most young persons are interested mainly in personal,
                        day-to-day problems and have few political feelings. This is less true than
                        it was 20 years ago. In the developed nations, the politically-conscious may
                        already be in the majority among the young. The important point is that the
                        young people that count are the concerned ones. They set the tone and
                        provide the impetus for the entire generation. The uninterested person is
                        politically inert. Only those motivated enough to express themselves—whether
                        by voting or by rioting—can influence society. History is made by the
                        activists. The <gloss target="#t_WYA_1">WYA</gloss> delegates expressed
                        opinions representative of the young activists of the world.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the negative aspect of youth thinking are too often
                        overemphasized, both in the information media and the Government. Most of
                        what went on at the <gloss target="#t_WYA_1">WYA</gloss> was quite positive.
                        The resolutions expressed the real idealism of youth and their genuine and
                        deep-felt concern for improving world conditions. Most of the sentiments
                        voiced by youth, e.g., for economic development, for self-determination, are
                        completely consistent with American goals and policies. We should not let
                        our differences obscure our real areas of agreement with the world’s young
                        people.</p>

                    <p>A variety of opinion studies in various countries suggest that the views
                        expressed at the <gloss target="#t_WYA_1">WYA</gloss> reflect the present
                        trends in youth—and especially in student—thinking. Among those that can be
                        mentioned:</p>
                    <p>A poll of Dutch, Swedish, Danish and Finnish university students, sponsored
                        by the Office of Naval Research and concluded in 1969, found that a low of
                        26.4% in Finland and a high of 45% in the Netherlands answered “yes” to the
                        question, “Is revolution by force better than evolution?” A poll conducted
                        by <hi rend="italic">Der Spiegel</hi> in 1968 found that 74% of German
                        university students and 67% of all Germans between 15 and 25 supported the
                        leftist-led student demonstrations in Germany that year.</p>
                    <pb facs="0362" n="310" xml:id="pg_310"/>
                    <p>Professor Robert Arnove, in <hi rend="italic">The Impact of University Social
                            Structure on Student Alienation: A Venezuelan Study</hi> (Stanford,
                        1970), finds that the more talented and self-confident university students
                        “more frequently mention Marxism, Communism or a leftist ideology in general
                        as alternatives to the present political regime.” Attitude studies conducted
                        by Arnove in Venezuela indicate that some 60% of the university students
                        surveyed believe that violence is needed to change the political situation
                        in that country.</p>

                    <p>A plethora of research by scholars and journalists also finds a leftist,

                        of the cold war is a major reason why “youth on both sides of the curtain
                        are seeking to reform or revolutionize their own societies.” (Rand document

                        says that the new political consciousness of youth leads them to oppose any

                    <p>A study conducted in Chile by Professor Myron Glazer in 1964 turned up

                        found that 88% favored either “substantial” reforms or “structural changes”
                        in Chilean society. Only 12% thought that “moderate reforms” were adequate.

                    <p>In the light of this and similar studies, no observor of the youth scene can

                    <p>More straws-in-the-wind: about 80% of the graduate students at the
                        relatively-conservative Cebu branch of the University of the Philippines are
                        “significantly discontented” with the country’s ruling establishment (<hi
                            rend="italic">Asian Survey</hi>, October, 1970). Professor Frank Penner
                        in <hi rend="italic">Students in Revolt</hi>, states that the political
                        beliefs of German students “diverge radically from those of the average

                        TOMORROW?</hi></p>
                    <p>Of course, unorthodox behavior among youth has been common for ages. This
                        disquieting phenomenon is widely discounted on the grounds that “boys will
                        be boys,” and that once young people mature and settle down, they will
                        become “just like everybody else.” Up until ten or twenty years ago this may
                        have been true. But today’s young person is a different breed of cat. The
                        experience of the 1950’s or the 1930’s is no longer a reliable guide to the
                        1970’s.</p>
                    <p>Undoubtedly most of today’s youth will become more moderate in the future, as
                        they assume career and family responsibilities. Many, especially the more
                        articulate and dedicated ones, will not. However, the crucial point is this:
                        even if all young people were to become conservative to the same degree as
                        did past generations, most of them will still end up in much more leftist
                        positions than did their fathers. This is so because today’s youth starts
                        from a position so much further to the left, and so much further from
                        adults, than used to be the case. What used to be a generation gap,
                        tolerable and expected, has become for many a generation chasm, intolerable
                        and mystifying. But one has to understand this chasm to understand why youth
                        will not opt for “business as usual” tomorrow. One has to understand it to
                        appreciate the tidal wave of change that is already upon us. Surveying the
                        situation from his position as Director-General of <gloss
                            target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss>, Rene Maheu declares, “The gulf
                        separating young people from adults seems to be growing bigger everyday.
                        This revolt is sweeping across virtually every part of the world; it has
                        taken the form of an open dispute, not only with the university, but with
                        society as a whole.”</p>

                        Dr. Keniston was one of the participants in the State Department-sponsored
                        symposium, “Worldwide Youth Unrest—Implications for Foreign Policy,” held in
                        the Washington International Center, February 14, 1970. During the
                        discussions, Dr. Keniston and other participants emphasized that the outlook
                        of tomorrow’s adults is likely to be considerably different from that of the
                        present over-35 generation. He said, “The rate of change is accelerating,
                        not just in this country but all over the world . . . in every country . . .
                        the gap between fathers and sons is not merely the usual <pb facs="0364"
                            n="312" xml:id="pg_312"/> fighting that goes on even in a static
                        society, but is a real difference in the life situations in which the sons
                        are growing up . . . There is something really new going on, and it is going
                        to be going on more and more as the rate of socio-economic change
                        accelerates.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. Lipset, in his Rand study, comments, “It is likely that the current
                        generation of radical university students will continue to affect the larger
                        body politic in many countries ten, twenty and even thirty years from now.
                        Their elites will contain a much larger proportion of liberals or leftists
                        than they now do. This will include many whose image of the United States
                        and its role in the world will be quite different from that of earlier
                        generations.” Dr. Lipset cites as an example studies in Japan which showed
                        that a majority of businessmen under 40 voted for the “pro-Marxist,
                        relatively radical” Japanese Socialist Party. “This more radical elite may
                        not do anything to change the system,” Dr. Lipset comments, “but their
                        beliefs may affect the way they react toward radical pressure on them from
                        other groups, as well as their view of new issues as they occur.”</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">YOUTH’S NEW WORLDVIEW</hi></p>
                    <p>The sum of serious research on the situation reveals that today’s youth has a
                        frame of reference, a way of perceiving reality and a psychological make-up
                        that is such that their differences with adults are becoming more and more
                            <hi rend="italic">qualitative</hi> rather than quantitative. It used to
                        be that, however great the differences of opinion may have seemed between
                        adults and youth, the disagreements were essentially differences of degree
                        within the same, overall cultural consensus. All shared basic assumptions
                        about the nature of things. The Argentine, the Iranian or the French youth
                        of yesterday may have been in left field and his father in right, but at
                        least they were in the same ball park. Today more and more adults and youth
                        are finding themselves in different ball parks. Differences are increasingly
                        not those of degree within a tacitly-accepted set of social norms, but <hi
                            rend="italic">of kind</hi> between mutually-exclusive value systems.
                        These are differences difficult, if not impossible, to resolve with the
                        passage of time, because they are differences in the conception of morality,
                        something that most people regard as non-negotiable.</p>
                    <p>The causes of these wide qualitative differences in psychological orientation
                        are basic and omnipresent. Psychologists and social scientists long ago
                        determined that a person’s worldview is determined primarily by his early
                        experiences. Dr. Lipset sums it up with “people tend to form a defined frame
                        of reference in late adolescence or early youth within which they fit
                        subsequent experiences. That is, the first formative political experiences
                        are most important.” (Rand document) The world that formed today’s 20-year
                        old, wherever he may be, is a <pb facs="0365" n="313" xml:id="pg_313"/>
                        qualitatively different world from the one that formed his father. It is not
                        unusual that the result is a different kind of person. The fathers of today
                        grew up in a world that, for all its superficial changes, was not much
                        different from the world of their fathers. Today’s sons have grown up in a
                        world (the 1960’s) that, in terms of social change, is light-years away from
                        the formative years of their fathers (the 1930’s and 1920’s).</p>
                    <p>Today’s older generation, as generations have always done, continues to abide
                        by the values it learned in its youth. Dr. Margaret Mead, in her perceptive

                        believes that the present social-psychological dislocation is so great that
                        the older generation must be considered “immigrants” into a modern world
                        that only youth can really understand. “Our thinking still binds us to the
                        past—to the world as it existed in our childhood and youth,” she writes.
                        “Born and bred before the electronic revolution, most of us do not realize
                        what it means.”</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">THE CHANGING SCENE</hi></p>
                    <p>Since 1945, several revolutionary developments have helped create this
                        radically-new environment. Briefly noted, they include:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Rapid Technological Progress.</hi> Ninety percent of the
                        scientists that ever lived are alive today. Much of the world is entering
                        the industrial age. Some of it is entering the post-industrial or, as
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Zbigniew Brzezinski</persName> terms it,
                        the “technotronic age.” Salient in the process is the impact of electronic
                        communications media. The transistor radio in the under-developed world and
                        television in the developed nations have done more than provide new sources
                        of information—they have changed man’s perception of reality. Unlike the
                        over-35 generation, today’s youth are growing up acutely aware of
                        alternative life-styles. As Margaret Mead points out, innovations in
                        technology “inevitably bring about alternations in cultural character.”</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Education Explosion.</hi> In just six years,
                        1960–66, the total world school enrollment burgeoned 32%. Between 1960 and
                        1965, the world total of university students rose 61%. (<gloss
                            target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> figures) This rapid expansion is
                        continuing at all levels. Education, even of the most elementary kind, is a
                        basic cause of attitude change.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Urban Explosion.</hi> Urbanization and value change
                        are closely related. Urban areas in the underdeveloped areas alone have
                        quadrupled in size in 40 years, <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss>
                        says. Much of this growth has <pb facs="0366" n="314" xml:id="pg_314"/>
                        occurred in the large capital cities which are focal points of political and
                        social discontent.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Increased Material Wellbeing.</hi> Despite the
                        continuing poverty and disease in much of the world, real gains in health
                        and economic prosperity have been registered in many areas. Meanwhile, the
                        industrialized nations have moved into an era of unprecedented
                        affluence.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">The Combined Effects of the Above Have Led to the Famous
                            “Revolution of Rising Expectations.”</hi> It is a basic tenet of social
                        science that the most unstable societies are those undergoing profound
                        changes in value systems. Also, as people get a taste of a better life, they
                        are awakened from complacency and despair and demand more. In the
                        underdeveloped countries this follows a familiar pattern: the cry for
                        economic progress and a voice in Government by those groups that have
                        traditionally been excluded from economic wellbeing and/or political
                        influence. The industrialized countries are experiencing their own brand of
                        rising expectations, and not just from racial and religious minorities. The
                        affluent young now have expectations of realizing the professed ideals of
                        their societies, ideals they feel are widely ignored in practice.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Finally, The Bomb.</hi> Youth, especially in the
                        advanced nations, are resentful of the continuing threat of nuclear
                        annihilation. With the decline of the cold war, this threat is no longer
                        seen as a necessary evil.</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">WHAT TO DO?</hi></p>
                    <p>The first thing we have to realize is that youth unrest will not go away.
                        Rather, all indications are it will spread and intensify. It appears to be
                        an inevitable result of the process of technological and social change,
                        which nobody imagines can be reversed. We may not like youth unrest, but we
                        are going to have to learn to live with it.</p>
                    <p>The second thing is by now a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> truism.
                        Whatever we may do, and however well we may do it, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> by itself cannot hope to divert the main thrust of the
                        world youth movement. Into the total world flood of information, our output
                        is measured from an eye-dropper. This does not mean we can do nothing. It
                        does mean we must avoid unrealistic expectations.</p>
                    <p>Socialism, anti-Americanism and Third Worldism will dominate world youth
                        thinking for a long time to come. What the effects of this will be in five
                        or ten years is a problem that our highest policymakers may wish to
                        ponder.</p>
                    <p>In spite of a seemingly-bleak situation, there is much we can do with the
                        middle-of-the-road and even the moderate leftist segment of world youth. Our
                        influence on carefully-chosen target groups can make a difference. But the
                        difference will be largely one of greater understanding and of cultivating a
                        live-and-let-live attitude. We cannot expect that any but a handful of youth
                        will like our system or support <pb facs="0367" n="315" xml:id="pg_315"/>
                        our policies. “We cannot expect to make every one our friend, but we can try

                    <p>With these caveats in mind, I offer some general recommendations on <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> youth programming.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Concentrate on Areas of Mutual Interest.</hi>
                        Everybody’s favorite topic is himself. Students and youth, especially those
                        in underdeveloped areas are so intensely concerned with the problem of their
                        own future and their countries that it is difficult to attract their
                        interest with unrelated matters. A few are curious about the U.S., but this
                        curiosity pales beside their overwhelming, parochial fascination with
                        themselves. All our youth programming should therefore address itself to the
                        first concern of human nature—“What’s in it for me?” Youth will be
                        interested in American policies and American life only so far as they
                        perceive a relevance to their own situation. The overriding interest of
                        youth is the economic and/or political development of their own nations. We
                        should concentrate on relating American policies and the American national
                        experience to this central concern. There is a place for programming and
                        media output that focuses entirely on the U.S., but it is a secondary place.
                        With youth, an indirect approach is better than a frontal assault.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Be Honest and Open.</hi> Credibility is extremely
                        difficult, and often impossible, for <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        to obtain from young people. The news media show all of America’s warts.
                        Youth, even more than others, react negatively to anything they perceive as
                        a cover-up, distortion or a half-truth. The first hint of an attempt to
                        whitewash America’s problems and whatever hard-won credibility we may have
                        established is gone—often for good. We shouldn’t be ashamed of being less
                        than perfect. Young people are perfectly willing to understand that
                        Americans can commit errors like anybody else, and still be human.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Let Controversy Thrive.</hi> It attracts interest. It
                        aids credibility. It’s the stuff today’s young people are raised on. Our
                        youth output should jump right into all the touchy issues of the day—campus
                        unrest, drugs, black power, urban violence, U.S. investments overseas, etc.
                        Let’s not suppose young people aren’t aware of these things and have not
                        heard the negative side of the story many times over. The difficulty is that
                        few of them will ever hear our side of the story unless we first gain their
                        attention, respect and at least some credibility by boldly facing <pb
                            facs="0368" n="316" xml:id="pg_316"/> up to these questions. It’s well
                        worth giving exposure to problems everybody knows about already in order to
                        give exposure to facts that everybody doesn’t know about.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Use the Soft-Sell.</hi> You can’t communicate with a
                        suspicious and often hostile audience by flag-waving, tub-thumping and
                        self-congratulation. America has no guaranteed solutions to world problems.
                        Perhaps we should be more humble; certainly we should be more subtle.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Maintain High Quality and Intellectual Content.</hi> Our
                        youth targets are primarily, if not exclusively, university student leaders,
                        and young intellectuals, politicians and the like. These people are
                        intelligent and often better informed than we realize. If they want anything
                        at all from us, it’s serious and up-to-date information. <hi rend="italic"

                        complain that we talk about ourselves too much. Some may wonder how <gloss

                        hostile to us they won’t listen to anything about us. Others are suspicious
                        of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> output, or bored by it. Many of
                        our policy objectives—promotion of democracy, economic development,
                        international cooperation—can be better advanced by talking about places
                        such as Japan, Sweden, or Australia. The moral of the story may be the same.
                        Only the setting would be different—and more acceptable to many. Likewise,
                        books, films, lectures and articles by non-Americans are often better
                        received than material by Americans. We can achieve our goals without

                        are not wild about the Russians either. We should respect this intense
                        nationalism of youth, and recognize it as the biggest force preventing them
                        from embracing the Russians or the Chinese. Respect for Third World
                        sentiment fits in with the Nixon Doctrine<note n="8" xml:id="d124fn8">See

                        aligning themselves militarily with our potential enemies. Fortunately, this

                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">A SPECIFIC SUGGESTION FOR
                        PROGRAMMING</hi></p>
                    <p>With the above in mind, I recommend that the Agency establish a program of
                        traveling seminars as the basis of its youth-directed activities. Seminars
                        and similar multi-media workshops are perhaps the most effective tool we
                        have for communicating with young audiences of all kinds. Programs of this
                        type have been successfully used in Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Korea and
                        the Philippines, as well as other posts. They have the advantage of
                        prolonged personal contacts, frank and open dialogue, and in-depth study of
                        problems of mutual concern. Also, a seminar is a vehicle around which other
                        program elements can logically be organized, e.g., educational exchange,
                        book presentations. Top-notch speakers and discussion leaders are the
                        crucial ingredient of a successful seminar. The best books, films and/or
                        exhibits are required. A convenient simultaneous translating arrangement may
                        be needed. Few posts have the resources, time or talent to meet these
                        demands, especially now, with the extensive cuts in personnel and budget.
                        Nonetheless, many posts appear to be interested in offering youth
                        seminars.</p>
                    <p>A series of circulating seminars might be the answer. We do not expect posts
                        to organize their own ballets, string quartets or basketball teams. The
                        Cultural Presentations program sends these groups out, and posts stage them.
                        Why could not youth seminars be presented in the same way? A seminar could
                        be put together on a topic of wide interest, such as economic development.
                        This could be used by different posts with minor local adaptations. It would
                        feature the best speakers and supporting material available. This approach
                        would have several advantages. It would allow seminars to be presented at
                        posts that are not able to mount their own. It would assure a high-quality
                        product, avoid duplication of effort between posts and save money by
                        spreading costs over a wider area.</p>

                        QUESTIONS</hi></p>
                    <p>The views offered above have been the subject of considerable debate within
                        the Agency over past weeks. I would like to try to give more complete
                        answers to the two questions that have been raised most frequently.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">“Even if there is a leftist, anti-American trend among
                            world youth, isn’t it just a fad? Won’t they see things differently when
                            they grow older?”</hi></p>
                    <pb facs="0370" n="318" xml:id="pg_318"/>
                    <p>This assumption is based on social and political conditions that existed
                        prior to 1950. The world milieu has changed so radically since then that it
                        is no longer a reliable prediction. I believe that most leftist students
                        will retain most of their dissident attitudes as they grow older. To
                        appreciate this, we must first identify the causes of the profound attitude
                        changes among youth. Then we must ask if these causes will continue to
                        operate in the future. If they do, it is reasonable to predict that the
                        development of new attitude structures will continue and spread in years to
                        come.</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY</hi></p>
                    <p>The basic, ultimate cause of worldwide youth unrest is rapid technological
                        change. Technology affects man’s attitudes both directly and indirectly. It
                        is the main force leading to such phenomena as increased urbanization,
                        spreading mass education and prosperity. These developments are supported by
                        technology, and, in an unending circle, also stimulate more and more
                        advances in technology as time goes by.</p>
                    <p>All of this should be no surprise. Technology has been a root cause of social
                        change throughout history. Inventions such as the steam engine and the
                        spinning jenny contributed to the Industrial Revolution, which radically
                        altered the environment, changed man’s conception of himself and society,
                        sundered traditional political relationships and provoked an ongoing
                        generation gap. These changes took place over a 150-year period.
                        Nonetheless, they produced tremendous social upheavals and frequent
                        violence.</p>
                    <p>The technological changes behind today’s attitudinal revolution occurred
                        largely in the last 25 years. This speed-up of change is exemplified by the
                        decreasing time lag between scientific discoveries and their practical
                        applications—for photography it was 112 years; radio, 35 years; the A-bomb,
                        six years; the solar battery, two years. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                            >Zbigniew Brzezinski</persName> says that “men living in the developed
                        world will undergo during the next several decades a mutation potentially as
                        basic as that experienced through the slow process of evolution from animal
                        to human experience. The difference, however, is that the process will be
                        telescoped in time—and hence the shock effect of the change may be quite
                        profound.”</p>

                        subsequently in adult populations throughout a particular society.”</p>
                    <p>Those under 30 have experienced only one social and political age, the
                        post-1945 era. Naturally enough, their attitudes are a response to their
                        perceptions of this modern epoch. Student attitudes are even more responsive
                        to the times than those of non-students because education widens one’s
                        perceptions of and receptivity to contemporary developments.</p>
                    <p>Older persons, on the other hand, have experienced two ages, the present and
                        the pre-1945 past. Their attitudes were shaped in an era that was, in many
                        ways, radically different from today. Experiences of childhood and teenage
                        years are the most important as far as value development is concerned. For
                        most people, these early, formative experiences serve as perception filters,
                        shielding their attitude structure from the disruptive effects of subsequent
                        social change. <gloss target="#t_Prof_1">Prof.</gloss> Cyril Black, in <hi

                        of doing things, identifying their personal security with the culture with
                        which they were indoctrinated in childhood.” Thus, most older persons have
                        been psychologically unable to adjust their world view to respond to the new
                        world environment, for to do so would threaten the whole moral and
                        ideological foundation upon which they have built their lives. The result,
                        as Raymond Aron notes, is that we now have “a generation whose perception of
                        the world is in many respects radically different from that of the preceding
                        generation.”</p>

                    <p>What are some of the broad social forces generated by technological
                        change?</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Urbanization.</hi> The cities of the developing nations
                        are growing at a rate that will double their population in 11 years. The
                        number of cities with more than a million persons has doubled (to 90) in the
                        past 25 years. Within the next 20 years, 75% of the world’s people will live
                        in urban areas. Most of this growth is due to internal migration. Studies by
                        Samuel Huntington, <persName corresp="#p_IF_1">Irving</persName> Horowitz
                        and others show how the urban environment nurtures radicalism and dissent,
                        especially among the young, by disrupting traditional attitude patterns
                        developed in rural settings.</p>
                    <pb facs="0372" n="320" xml:id="pg_320"/>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Communications.</hi> Traditional belief systems have
                        begun to crumble before the onslaught of electronic communications media.
                        The number of radios increased 88%, and television sets, 257%, in Brazil
                        from 1958 to 1966. In India comparable figures for the same period were 316%
                        and 900%. Other countries show similar increases.</p>
                    <p>During the reign of print media, information dissemination was greatly
                        limited by illiteracy and geography. Also, reading a newspaper is a less
                        dramatic experience than watching television. Thus it was easier for people
                        to be ignorant of, or emotionally detached from, current events. Today,
                            <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> and radio help young people break
                        through the limits of parochial experience to discover the possibilities of
                        new modes of existence. This causes intense dissatisfaction with the <hi

                        solutions.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Education.</hi> India’s primary school enrollment jumped
                        from 18.5 million in 1951 to 51.5 million in 1966. France’s university
                        population, climbed 174% between 1958 and 1965. World university enrollment
                        has risen 100% since 1960. Such figures suggest the dimensions of the recent
                        educational explosion.</p>
                    <p>As Dr. Lipset and others point out (see <hi rend="italic">Youth and

                        highly correlated with political instability, leftism and anti-Americanism.
                        Dr. Arnove, in the study cited above, says, “Intense student involvement in
                        the problems of a developing country also is likely to lead to more radical
                        political sympathies.”</p>

                        Many young people in the industrialized countries have known nothing but
                            prosper<pb facs="0373" n="321" xml:id="pg_321"/>ity. They are in the
                        fortunate position of being able to concern themselves with questions that
                        go beyond society’s material requirements into the realm of social ethnics
                        and the quality of man’s existence. In a seeming paradox, their values have
                        been made possible by technologically-induced prosperity, yet they challenge
                        the way prosperity has been created and used in advanced societies.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> says, “Now, for the first
                        time in recorded history, man is beginning—though just beginning—to liberate
                        himself from the oppressive struggle to survive as a physical being. This
                        has prompted a renewed concern with the more elusive, spiritual aspects of
                        existence; it has also created a state of agitation; in which systematic
                        dialogue increasingly breaks down because of the lack of shared
                        assumptions.”</p>
                    <p>In the underdeveloped countries, however, the possibilities of progress are
                        widely perceived but little realized. However, enough progress has been made
                        so that poverty is no longer stoically accepted as inevitable. The gap
                        between rising expectations and brutal reality is a leading cause of
                        radicalism. As <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> says,
                        modernization in traditional societies “both lays the ground work for
                        well-being and stability and enhances the forces working for instability and
                        revolution.”</p>

                        technology, lessening cold war tensions have been a factor in youth unrest,
                        especially in Europe. Societies that feel threatened tend to draw together.
                        They value conformity, overlook social ills and indulge in
                        self-congratulation on the grounds that dissent weakens the society <hi

                        less dangerous, societies become less defensive of their shortcomings.
                        Social and intellectual diversity set in. Domestic concerns regain priority.
                        Young people respond to these changes more quickly than do older persons. As
                        a result, they become dissatisfied with public policies and attitudes
                        derived from the cold war milieu.</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">THE PERMANENCE OF THE NEW WORLD VIEW</hi></p>
                    <p>The aforementioned social forces form a chain of directly related causes and
                        effects. Technology leads to increased urbanization, mass communications,
                        mass education and material progress. In turn these developments stimulate
                        more and newer technology. They also bring about the formation of new
                        attitude patterns which collide with traditional values and
                        institutions.</p>
                    <p>The slowness of institutional change breeds political radicalism. Lagging
                        development causes old-style leftism in the Third World, while widespread
                        prosperity contributes to New Leftism in the industrialized nations. Both
                        leftisms develop into cultural and political anti-Americanism because the
                        United States is widely perceived by young people to be an energetic

                    <p>Student and youth unrest will continue and spread in coming years because the
                        social forces that cause it will continue and spread. More important for the
                        future of American foreign policy, as the dissatisfied young grow older,
                        they will maintain most of their dissenting attitudes. This is not only
                        because the disgruntled young are more numerous and more radical than they
                        used to be—though they certainly will derive sustenance from their numbers
                        and the intensity of their beliefs. It is because the social conditions that
                        caused youthful attitude changes will be continually available in the future
                        to support and reinforce this new world view.</p>
                    <p>Today’s young rebels were nurtured in an environment created by technology.
                        Despite the modifying effects of family and career responsibilities—not to
                        mention hostile mainstream cultures—these new attitudes will be largely
                        sustained by a world environment that will be even more technologically
                        influenced in the future.</p>
                    <p>This contrasts sharply with the situation of 30 years ago, which is
                        frequently and erroneously cited as an example of how today’s radicals will
                        become conservative with age. In the industrialized countries, yesterday’s
                        radicals were mostly products of the Depression. Their radicalism was mostly
                        concerned with material conditions. By and large, their basic values were
                        not too different from those of the mainstream culture. They wanted to
                        restore prosperity and gain a more equitable distribution of wealth and
                        political power, usually through a statist approach. It was generally
                        assumed that any philosophical problems of alienation and identity would
                        automatically be resolved if “economic man” was taken care of. Their
                        radicalism was essentially one-dimensional and, in many cases, only skin
                        deep. When the economic crisis ended, so did most radicalism. Today,
                        however, the causes of youthful radicalism are not going to disappear. While
                        the Depression was a shortlived exception to the main tide of events, the
                        cause of today’s radicalism <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the main tide of
                        events.</p>
                    <p>In the Third World, yesterday’s radicals were scarce. Such as existed were
                        products of isolated, modern enclaves such as universities, or of experience
                        in alien, modern countries. Both situations were exceptions to the
                        mainstream of their native societies, which were still traditional and as
                        yet little affected by the broad impact of technology. It was difficult for
                        attitudes born of advanced societies to flourish in such an environment.
                        Youthful radicals easily reverted to traditional value patterns after
                        leaving school or returning home from overseas. Today, the underdeveloped
                        world is changing so rapidly that old values are in disarray. The old
                        cultures are strong enough to conflict violently with the new attitudes, but
                        not strong enough to stifle them. As the pace of change quickens in the
                        Third World, traditional cultures will continue to weaken and the new
                        environment will offer increasing support for radical viewpoints.</p>
                    <pb facs="0375" n="323" xml:id="pg_323"/>
                    <p>In short, yesterday’s radicalism, whether in the developed or underdeveloped
                        world, was largely caused by situations that were exceptions to the rule.
                        Today’s radicalism is caused by events that are, and will continue to be,
                        the rule.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">“Even if radical new attitudes persist, only a minority
                            maintains such views. Aren’t we paying too much attention to
                        it?”</hi></p>
                    <p>History is strewn with the wreckage of social systems that were threatened by
                        minorities. If conditions are right and their ideas are attractive enough,
                        such minorities can become the predominant influence in society. The tide of
                        events indicate that this will happen in many countries in the
                        not-too-distant future.</p>
                    <p>In the Third World, radical and anti-American viewpoints are becoming common
                        among all urban youth, regardless of their educational level. Such attitudes
                        are more frequent, of course, among better educated young persons. In the
                        industrialized nations these views are largely, but by no means, entirely,
                        confined to the small university-educated elite. In all nations, the
                        revolution in youth attitudes is taking place most rapidly among university
                        students.</p>
                    <p>When one talks of minorities, it must be remembered that the college-educated
                        is the single most important minority in many societies. The tide of events
                        makes this educated elite even more important as time goes by. This is
                        because, as nations modernize and develop, knowledge in all its forms
                        becomes increasingly important as the fuel for still further social and
                        economic progress. The university becomes more and more indispensable as a
                        source of innovation. Consequently, those persons who develop and use
                        knowledge become more influential. Knowledge increasingly becomes the basis
                        for social and political power. Traditional sources of power—money,
                        ascriptive status, religion, repression—decline in relative
                        significance.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> points out that, as
                        societies become more advanced, political leadership is increasingly
                        permeated “by individuals possessing special skills and intellectual
                        talents. Knowledge becomes a tool of power and the effective mobilization of
                        talent an important way to acquire power.”</p>
                    <p>In his introduction to the multi-national student survey sponsored by the
                        Office of Naval Research in 1968, <gloss target="#t_Prof_1">Prof.</gloss>
                        John Raser says there is considerable empirical evidence to indicate that
                        the students he surveyed will play key social and political roles in their
                        respective countries in the future. He also says the attitudes of these
                        students are stable enough so that they will be “much the same” in the
                        future. Partial results of this survey are noted earlier in this study.</p>
                    <p>In short, the tremendous importance of this educated minority resides in the
                        fact that, to an even greater degree than in the past, it will supply the
                        power wielders of tomorrow.</p>

                        Morocco, Mauritania, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>“<hi rend="italic">South Asia</hi>—This new area encompasses the South Asian

                        It includes India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Ceylon, and Burma.</p>
                    <p>“<hi rend="italic">Africa</hi>—The present Africa area is unchanged except
                        for the deletion of those countries transferred to the Near East and North

                            making important placement of entire media products. This stems from the
                            growing sophistication, affluence and overseas correspondents of foreign
                            media organizations. There has been no comparable difficulty in reaching

                            large variety of up-to-date and effective material carrying a full share
                            of Washington policy thrust. This would allow the PAOs to pick, adapt
                            and use from abundance.</p>

                        reflected the view that our military operations are designed ultimately to

                            visit to the People’s Republic of China. (Chalmers M. Roberts, “Chinese

                        it be “fairly soon” for maximum impact. This would be preferable, he said,
                        to capitalize on current news interest and because of a possibility that
                        delay in some way might ruin prospects for a trip.</p>

                    <p>The President suggested that all arrangements be handled very subtley by me.
                        He said perhaps I would be “too visible” and would have to coordinate
                        everything from backstage, while someone else was out front, perhaps someone
                        close to the President but outside the government. However, he said maybe I
                        should be out front, depending on what <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> and I decide is best. He emphasized keeping the
                        State Department informed in order to keep their officials happy.</p>
                    <p>The President said it was important to do “exactly the same” in providing the
                        Chinese with travel opportunities, visits, and hospitality as the American
                        Table Tennis Team had while in China. The President said he, of course,
                        would be most pleased to meet with them. The locale of the President’s visit
                        was not necessarily an important factor but the President said he would be
                        quite willing to meet with them in San Clemente. After all, it would have a
                        tremendous impact, particularly on the West Coast.</p>
                    <p>The President said he would see to it that funds are available for the
                        sponsors of the tour so that this will not be a problem. The President said
                        he was particularly pleased that Bill Gossett, former president of the
                            <gloss target="#t_ABA_1">ABA</gloss>, who is a friend, has been brought
                        into the picture by <persName corresp="#p_SG_2">Steenhoven</persName>.
                        Gossett is first rate, and I should keep in close touch with him to make
                        sure that we keep control throughout, either through backstage or out front
                        operations. The President stressed that this Chinese visit was not just
                        another exchange, but should be treated as something special and that he
                        would rely on me to make sure this is done.</p>
                    <p>The President said <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName>

                            Themes</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Purpose of this message is to identify themes about American society for use
                        by Agency media and, as applicable, by individual posts. These themes are
                        not definitive or exclusive: they do represent principal points that we want
                        to communicate to our foreign audiences.</p>
                    <p>There is an excess of noise and information in communications today. Only if
                        we focus our message can we hope our audiences will focus their attention on
                        what we have to say. The foreign listener receives a myriad of facts,
                        impressions and signals about our large and complex society. One of <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s chief tasks is to call attention to
                        the fundamentals of our society and help our audiences put rapidly moving
                        and frequently confusing day-by-day developments into perspective.</p>
                    <p>Familiar principles of communication, of course apply. We should repeat,
                        reinforce, recapitulate; facts presented in isolation have far less impact
                        than facts ordered explicitly and consecutively to support a well-defined
                        theme. We must be relevant to our audiences, encouraging them to feel a
                        sense of common endeavor with us, and speaking where possible in terms of
                        their own experience.</p>
                    <p>Every nation has a style. The American style is movement, innovation,
                        experiment. The vitality of American life presents an obvious magnet; we
                        should seek to capitalize on it, particularly with younger audiences. The
                        content and presentation of Agency media, and the atmosphere of our offices,
                        centers and programs abroad should reinforce the image of a pioneering and
                        dynamic nation.</p>
                    <p>Our tone, neither boastful nor defensive, should reflect our conviction and
                        confidence.</p>

                                Freedom</hi></p>
                        <p>The institutions established for the American Republic two centuries ago,
                            and modified since to meet contemporary conditions, embody the spirit of
                            liberty. In contrast to societies which seek to repress “inimical”
                            ideas, the American system seeks to enlist the efforts of all who would
                            make a contribution. This ensures that new thinking confronts new
                            problems, and that the institutions of government, based on the popular
                            will, remain responsive.</p>
                        <p>The free circulation of dissenting opinion is basic to the American
                            democratic process. The right of minorities to express their views by
                            legal and non-violent means, is guaranteed. Illustrations of dissenting
                            opinion ultimately being adopted by the majority, or becoming public
                            policy, show democracy at work.</p>
                        <p>America’s political, economic, and social institutions seek to give
                            maximum liberty to the individual, while providing for such governmental
                            intervention as is necessary to insure the public interest. These
                            institutions are subject to constant re-examination and modification, to
                            correct weaknesses and meet changed conditions.</p>
                        <p>The continuing public debate over the nature and the functioning of our
                            institutions is a source of strength. Through free competition of ideas
                            comes progress.</p>

                                Opportunity</hi></p>
                        <p>Equality of opportunity has been a national ideal since America’s
                            founding as a nation. In large part, American history is the record of a
                            continuing attempt to realize this ideal.</p>
                        <p>At the heart of the American commitment to equality of opportunity is
                            education. Educational institutions are diversified in structure, free
                            of centralized control, and by their nature are conducive to experiment.
                            They have achieved both mass and quality education to a remarkable
                            degree. Today American schools and universities are the focus of a
                            national effort, public and private, to meet new demands brought about
                            by rapid social change.</p>
                        <p>Each American generation has seen material advancement of the
                            less-favored groups. While enjoying an unparalleled standard of living,
                            the nation today is deeply aware of the minority who do not fully share
                            in its material well-being; varied initiatives are being undertaken to
                            help. Allocations for human resources make up the largest share of the
                            federal budget today. Abetting these efforts of government, and the
                            self-help endeavors of those lowest on the economic scale, business
                            leaders are using corporate funds to train the formerly-unemployable,
                            and give them a boost up the earning ladder.</p>
                        <p>Since World War II racial minorities have made accelerated strides, while
                            a new principle of compensation for past disadvantage has been accepted.
                            Through Republican and Democratic Administrations the process of
                            mobility in American society has been furthered by court decisions,
                            legislation and Presidential initiatives. Minorities have used peaceful
                            demonstrations, labor union organization and the ballot to win a bigger
                            stake in America.</p>

                        <p>The arts in the United States are characterized by imagination, variety,
                            innovation. Their quality has won world-wide interest and acclaim.
                            Artists have shown a special facility for working with the materials of
                            their modern civilization; their work expresses the contemporary
                            American desire to probe the relationship between technology and human
                            values. Private philanthropy, community efforts, business support and,
                            recently, governmental assistance all help artists make their works
                            available to a broader public.</p>
                        <p>Similar vigor and creativity are seen in the sciences. Americans have led
                            the way in recognizing the value of research and in turning the fruits
                            of science, through technology, into practical advances for human
                            betterment. The American university is uniquely open-ended to Federal
                            and State governments and the community, simultaneously serving them all
                            while involving itself in common problems and needs. From its pioneering
                            work in the social sciences, both theory and application, to the
                            physical science investigations that have produced the preponderance of
                            Nobel Prize winners, to the triumphs of the moon landings and the
                            practical benefits of space exploration, America has charted new ground.

                                a New Age</hi></p>
                        <p>The United States is in the forefront of a new technological age,
                            adapting to unprecedentedly rapid change. In science, industry, and
                            social organization, America is pioneering. The forces of change, rather
                            than the “status quo,” mark American society.</p>
                        <p>America’s very success in developing a highly productive, complex
                            post-industrial society has resulted in new challenges to be met. Rapid
                            technological change has inevitably brought with it tensions and
                            dislocations in established patterns. If the past is any guide, America
                            will seek to meet these challenges with a flexible, pragmatic
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>Young Americans are particularly sensitive to the need to adapt the
                            organization and forms of the social structure to accommodate the new
                            challenges. Their idealism and energy contribute significantly to the
                            efforts of more mature Americans in the search for constructive
                            solutions.</p>
                        <p>There is growing realization of the need for new relationships between
                            citizens and government. The President’s proposals to reorganize the
                            Federal government, decentralize governmental responsibilities,<note
                                n="6" xml:id="d131fn6">In his State of the Union address, delivered
                                before a joint session of Congress on January 22, 1971, the
                                President described the “six great goals” designed to restructure
                                the U.S. Government. For the text of the address, see <hi

                                        >Nixon</persName>, 1971</hi>, pp. 50–58. With regards to
                                government decentralization, <persName corresp="#p_NP_1"
                                    >Nixon</persName> asserted that the “time has now come in
                                America to reverse the flow of power and resources from the States
                                and communities to Washington, and start power and resources flowing
                                back from Washington to the States and communities and, more
                                important, to the people all across America.” (Ibid., p. 53) He
                                indicated that he would send a series of revenue sharing proposals
                                designed to provide states with “more money and less interference.”
                                (Ibid., p 54) <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName>’s
                                government reorganization proposal centered on the reduction of the
                                current 12 Cabinet departments to 8. The Departments of State,
                                Treasury, Defense, and Justice would remain in their current forms,
                                while the remaining departments would be “consolidated into four:
                                Human Resources, Community Development, Natural Resources, and
                                Economic Development.” (Ibid., p. 56) The President asserted that
                                the time “has come to match our structure to our purposes—to look
                                with a fresh eye, to organize the Government by conscious,
                                comprehensive design to meet the new needs of a new era.” (Ibid.)
                                Congress failed to take action on the reorganization proposal
                                contained within the State of the Union address other than to hold a
                                series of hearings. However, Congress, in 1971, did accept a
                                Reorganization Plan that merged federal voluntary programs, such as
                                the Peace Corps and <gloss target="#t_VISTA_1">VISTA</gloss>, into a

                            far-reaching. It is too soon to predict in what form the proposals may
                            be adopted; but there has been a strong response in Congress, among
                            state and local officials, <pb facs="0392" n="340" xml:id="pg_340"/> and
                            in the nation as a whole to the idea of a re-examination of national
                            priorities and governmental structures.</p>
                        <p>America’s size, strength, resources and dynamism in entering its
                            post-industrial phase may seem to separate the United States from other
                            nations. And indeed there are indications that America’s technological
                            lead is growing rather than diminishing. But many of the new challenges
                            which America faces are presenting themselves with only slight
                            modifications, or to a lesser degree, in other industrialized nations.
                            The same challenges in large measure must be faced in the future by
                            those countries just beginning to industrialize. The need to develop new
                            patterns of life, improve public services, find adequate sources of
                            taxation, and combat environmental pollution are not unique to America,
                            or even to the Northern Hemisphere. Neither can these problems be solved
                            in isolation from America’s neighbors in the world. America welcomes
                            international cooperation in seeking solutions.</p>

                    <p>The new <gloss target="#t_YOPP_1">YOPP</gloss> met for the first time April
                        14. This letter describes some of the results of our day-long meeting.
                        Briefly, we developed a rough agenda and agreed upon procedure. Panel
                        members found that their concerns tended to fall into three intellectual
                        pigeonholes: Prob<pb facs="0393" n="341" xml:id="pg_341"/>lems of Agency
                        structure, professionalism, and communication with constituents. We discuss
                        each in turn.—</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The structure of the Agency encourages inefficiency and
                            should be changed.</hi> Our present system of vertical compartmenting
                        leads to a duplication of effort, difficulty in coordinating the work of the
                        media and the field, and a waste of talent. Horizontal communication, so
                        important to creative programming, is limited and ineffective. We work in
                        isolation.</p>
                    <p>For example, radio, press, television and film, and other media offices in
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> are artificially separated. The
                        workers in one medium are usually ignorant of what takes place in the others
                        and are not normally encouraged to find out.</p>
                    <p>It is difficult for one media to use talent assigned to another even though
                        such exchange may be in the best interests of the Agency. <hi rend="italic"
                            >There is an overall need to coordinate the media and to break down
                            bureaucratic barriers.</hi></p>
                    <p>The division of <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts into information
                        and cultural sections is another example of a structure of doubtful
                        efficiency. And our vast and anonymous administrative bureaucracy presents
                        what may be the most intractable problem of all.</p>
                    <p>Given these difficulties, it seems reasonable to ask if we might not find
                        some better way of organizing ourselves. And it seems reasonable to suggest
                        that we might redesign our bureaucratic apparatus to encourage initiative
                        rather than continue to strangle it. <gloss target="#t_YOPP_1">YOPP</gloss>
                        hopes to develop concrete suggestions for reorganization of the Agency, and
                        plans to make specific proposals on individual issues. We need your
                        ideas.</p>
                    <p>(And then we have the distinction between young and old in <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, as if there must be some qualitative
                        philosophical difference determined by chronology. Why do we have a <hi
                            rend="italic">Young</hi> Officers Policy Panel? Are we better than older
                        officers? Are we worse? Perhaps the <gloss target="#t_YOPP_1">YOPP</gloss>
                        could, in its fervor to reorganize, reorganize itself. We may pursue this
                        speculation.)</p>

                    <p><gloss target="#t_YOPP_1">YOPP</gloss> wants to know more about <gloss
                            target="#t_FAS_1">FAS</gloss>. We are looking into it. The new system
                        could help improve job mobility and reduce bureaucratic barriers to
                        communication within <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, if it is
                        properly carried out.</p>
                    <p>Under this topic of the improvement of the use of personnel, this panel asks
                        itself if the present enforced distinction between “specialists” and
                        “generalists” should be continued. Are these two forms of humanity mutually
                        exclusive? The panel feels that, in the business of professional
                        communication, excessive and enforced specialization is stultifying to the
                        individual and consequently bad for the Agency.</p>
                    <p>Several panel members note that media personnel have little chance to learn
                        about their audiences and in consequence produce in a vacuum. Because of
                        this, persons in the field often find media products irrelevant to their
                        audiences and hence ineffective. This is an old complaint and the problem
                        persists despite the years of complaining.</p>
                    <p>To help improve matters, the panel proposes to encourage the exposure of
                        working-level media personnel to information about their audiences. This can
                        be done through open forums, visiting lectures (both U.S. and foreign
                        nationals), and more frequent working-level conferences. Eventually <gloss
                            target="#t_FAS_1">FAS</gloss> might have a salutary effect in helping
                        promote contact between media personnel and audiences.</p>
                    <p>If specialization frustrates the specialist in Washington, the generalist
                        doctrine equally keeps the generalist down. Officers in the field, our
                        so-called generalists, are often inadequately trained in the tools of their
                        trade. They are especially unfamiliar with modern techniques—multi-media,
                        layout and printing, <hi rend="italic">Abstracta</hi> and other modern
                        exhibits tools, contemporary graphics, etc.</p>
                    <p>Is it unreasonable to suggest that we might profitably generalize the
                        specialists, and teach the generalists something about the specialties of
                        the trade? The panel thinks that this is reasonable and will seek ways to
                        promote training and, for want of a better word, cross-fertilization. Let us
                        hear from you.</p>
                    <p>We need to look closely at recruiting, <gloss target="#t_JOT_1">JOT</gloss>
                        training, membership on the Board of Examiners and promotion panels. It is
                        rumored that the Agency has difficulty in recruiting the best minds of our
                        generation. Is this true? Can we do anything about it? Should we do anything
                        about it?</p>

                    <p>I am pleased to have the honor to address you in the Smithsonian Institution
                        in two capacities: as a Secretary of State with a keen interest in the
                        relationship between science and foreign policy and as a member of the
                        establishment. If any of you has ever, as I have, wondered what the precise
                        definition of this term was, you need have no doubt about its meaning in
                        these halls.</p>
                    <p>To the Smithsonian, the establishment consists of the President of the United
                        States, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the Cabinet. For they are
                        the legal entity which has since 1846 constituted the Smithsonian
                        Institution under the official title of the Establishment.</p>
                    <p>May I begin by adding my most sincere congratulations to our guests of honor.
                        They were honored this morning by the President of the United States for the
                        distinguished contributions they have made to science in a most impressive
                        ceremony at the White House.<note n="2" xml:id="d134fn2"><persName

                    <p>We in the Nixon administration are highly conscious of the profound influence
                        which science and technology have on our foreign policy. I had an
                        opportunity to stress this point in January at the 12th meeting of the Panel
                        on Science and Technology of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics
                        by saying that our basic goal is to put science and technology at the
                        service of human—and humane—ends.<note n="3" xml:id="d134fn3">For Secretary

                    <p>Science by its nature is universal and is insistent upon the interaction of
                        scientists working at the frontiers of knowledge regardless of the
                        divergencies and differences of policy which may separate the nations in
                        which they hold citizenship. In my opinion, this has served well the cause
                        of world peace. For the scientists have a very special <pb facs="0398"
                            n="346" xml:id="pg_346"/> capacity to establish communication and

                        a constructive kind.</p>
                    <p>Thus, when the final history of U.S.-Soviet relations in the postwar era is
                        written, the helpful role of the scientists will properly loom very large. I
                        think it is accurate to say that the largest area of contact and
                        relationships between Soviets and Americans is in the scientific field. I
                        have followed with great satisfaction in the last half year or so the
                        enlarging areas of relationships between the United States and the Soviet
                        Union in the space field. These hold great promise of progress in the use of
                        outer space for the benefit of all mankind. I also understand that
                        arrangements are nearing completion under which U.S. and Soviet medical
                        scientists will pursue cooperative research, going beyond exchanges, in the
                        important fields of cancer, arteriosclerosis, and health effects of
                        environmental pollutants.</p>
                    <p>One point I made in my remarks in January was that it is “the general policy
                        of this administration to permit the exchange of unclassified scientific and
                        technical information with the scientists and institutions of any country,
                        regardless of the state of our diplomatic relations with that country.” This
                        policy underlines our belief that restrictions on the free exchange of
                        information are not compatible with the open world we seek. There was
                        immediate speculation in the press on whether this statement included the
                        People’s Republic of China.<note n="4" xml:id="d134fn4">See Richard D.

                            27, 1971, p. A5.</note> The answer is that it did. If the People’s
                        Republic of China—or any other country—is interested in unclassified
                        scientific exchanges, we are prepared to enter into appropriate arrangements
                        with them.</p>
                    <p>The exchange of unclassified scientific and technical information on the
                        widest possible basis would be a useful step toward the building of more
                        cooperative relationships with mainland China. Another useful step would be
                        the expansion of face-to-face contacts. In this there is a special role that
                        the intellectual community, and especially scientists, can play.</p>
                    <p>We are pleased with the reports of the Chinese issuance of visas to American
                        newsmen and to a few American scientists. We look forward to an opportunity
                        to reciprocate. Thus far, however, we have not received any applications for
                        visas from citizens of the People’s Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>I have been glad to learn that many American scientists and scientific
                        organizations are issuing invitations to Chinese scientists to attend
                        meetings and conferences in the United States. We in the Government <pb
                            facs="0399" n="347" xml:id="pg_347"/> do not offer advice on the
                        specific invitation or the individual to be invited. However, I can assure
                        you that, in the event these invitations are accepted and visa applications
                        filed, I will take a personal and sympathetic interest in the speedy
                        processing of those applications.</p>
                    <p>Another aspect of the relationship between science and foreign policy is the
                        extent to which technology can help preserve the environment in which we
                        live. This problem cuts across ideological and economic differences among
                        nations. Many aspects of it can best be attacked on a global or regional
                        basis; for example, desalting, weather modification, and pollution control.
                        We are currently engaged in the search for ways to pool the world’s
                        technical knowledge and to coordinate international efforts.</p>
                    <p>Preparations are now actively underway for the U.N. Conference in Stockholm

                        There the nations of the world will make a concerted attempt to identify the
                        most pressing environmental problems and means for dealing with them. Just
                        this week the Secretary of State’s Advisory Committee on the 1972 United
                        Nations Conference on the Human Environment met for the first time in the
                        State Department. I appointed this Committee, with Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_BH_1">Howard Baker</persName> as its Chairman, to aid us in
                        our preparations for Stockholm. With its help, we are determined to do all
                        we can to make the Stockholm Conference a success.</p>
                    <p>Our scientific relations with other countries are in good condition. We need
                        now to devote increasing attention to technological relations. A number of
                        countries, particularly those in Eastern Europe and in the developing world,
                        are placing greater emphasis on technological relationships than on academic
                        and scientific relationships. We are sympathetic to their needs and are
                        responding to them where we can.</p>
                    <p>However, as you know, in our society technology lies principally in the
                        private sector. Government has traditionally played a very limited role.
                        Moreover, there is no equivalent in the field of technology to the
                        International Council of Scientific Unions. There are at the moment more
                        questions than answers available in our approach to this matter. But we are
                        anxious to find ways of helping others to gain the technological
                        capabilities to solve their local problems. This indeed is a major new
                        thrust in our policy of assistance to developing countries.</p>
                    <p>A considerable measure of accomplishment in the growing interaction between
                        technology and foreign policy was demonstrated just 2 hours ago when
                        delegates from 73 nations voted approval of an agree<pb facs="0400" n="348"

                        negotiating these arrangements for 27 months. Thus, in the 10 years since
                        the first experimental communications satellite flew, a large number of
                        nations have worked out together the political and economic relationships
                        whereby initial development of a new space technology has become a global
                        operating system to serve their mutual needs.</p>
                    <p>There are, of course, many other aspects to the growing ties between science
                        and foreign policy. President <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName>
                        said earlier this year that the problems and opportunities created by
                        science and technology “constitute the new dimension of our foreign policy
                        and of international life. The greatest importance attaches to our
                        performance in this new dimension, for upon it rests much of the hope for a
                        better future.”<note n="7" xml:id="d134fn7">The complete text of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName>’s foreign policy report

                    <p>It is in this spirit that I address the distinguished scientists we are
                        honoring today. The challenges within this new dimension of foreign policy
                        call for new levels of international cooperation. We in Government, and
                        especially those of us in the foreign affairs field, need your support. For
                        your work, and the work of your colleagues around the world, is of the

                    <p>As we heard again in the most recent Anglo-American talks, the British make a
                        good thing out of their Information Research Department. While we can’t hope
                        to duplicate their efforts, it does strike me that we could be doing more in
                        the direction of inspiring articles by carefully calculated placement of
                        certain “sanitized” classified documents with selected journalists around
                        the world.</p>
                    <p>The dangers, of course, are obvious. Articles inspired by such operations
                        would have to be completely unattributable. The choice of documents to be
                        sanitized and “placed” is a matter requiring the most delicate and sensitive
                        political judgment. The interests of other agencies would have to be
                        protected carefully, but hopefully by something less than a full clearance
                        procedure which leads to perfect safety—and perfect dullness!</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, we do have a precedent for successful operations of this sort.
                        For many years the Vienna Special Projects Office, with the concurrence of
                        the Department and of Ambassadors concerned, carried on a similar operation
                        with telegrams and airgrams received from missions in Eastern Europe and the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Although it lasted for about ten
                        years, I am told there was never any instance of embarrassment to the <gloss
                            target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> or our missions in Eastern Europe and the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>I believe a centralized operation in our Agency carried on by 1–2 officers
                        with a global purview could perform similar useful and profitable work for
                        us.</p>

                    <p>In a May 26, 1971, memorandum to the heads of departments and agencies,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Richard Nixon</persName> referenced
                        the increase in federal arts spending, specifically for the National
                        Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities. <persName corresp="#p_NP_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> acknowledged that the Endowment programs “are by no
                        means the only Federal programs that affect, employ or contribute to the
                        arts.” He continued: “It is my urgent desire that the growing partnership
                        between Government and the arts continue to be developed to the benefit of
                        both, and more particularly to the benefit of the people of America.” To
                        that end, the President asked the agency and department heads to focus
                        attention upon two questions: “First, how, as a part of its various
                        programs, your agency can most vigorously assist the arts and artists;
                        second, and perhaps more important, how the arts and artists can be of help
                        to your agency and to its programs.” <persName corresp="#p_NP_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> concluded by indicating that he had asked the Chair of
                        the National Endowment for the Arts <persName corresp="#p_HN_1">Nancy
                            Hanks</persName> to coordinate the interagency response, due by

                        commented: “We in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> are particularly
                        sensitive to the increasingly important role of artists in conditioning the
                        quality of life in the United States. We recognize that, to a significant
                        degree, the reputation of American civilization in the world is a measure of
                        the place accorded to the arts in the United States. <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s policy directives and programs
                        accordingly give due weight to these considerations.” (Ibid.)</p>
                    <pb facs="0403" n="351" xml:id="pg_351"/>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> report, entitled “The United
                        States Information Agency and the Arts,” restated <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>’s task of portraying to foreign audiences American
                        culture, noting that the Agency had used arts and artists in pursuit of this
                        objective. It summarized the various types of arts programs conducted either
                        under <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> auspices or with <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> support, highlighting the various visual
                        and aural mediums employed, noting that while the examples employed in the
                        report “are by no means exhaustive, the types of programs described are
                        representative of the kinds of activities the Agency utilizes in support of
                        artists and the arts. The Agency hopes that benefits are mutual. In addition
                        to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> objectives that are served by
                        performers, the Agency becomes a link between American artists and other
                        cultural traditions and art forms. Moreover, it provides opportunities for
                        American artists to be seen and appreciated by foreign audiences. Like other
                        branches of government, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is limited in
                        what it can do by resources; however, the Agency’s conviction that the arts
                        are an indispensable reflection of cultural life in the United States is a
                        long standing one.”</p>
                    <p>The conclusion of the report presented the following recommendations:</p>
                    <p>“In considering how the arts and artists can be of further help to <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, the major point is that the Agency,
                        given its objective of reflecting the cultural image of the United States,
                        could do a great deal more of what it is now doing in this field if more
                        opportunities and resources were available.</p>
                    <p>“American artists in fairly large numbers are already seen under commercial
                        or private auspices in the principal cities of Western Europe and Latin
                        America. It would be helpful if more of them could be made available for
                        performances in the smaller centers of those areas and, even more
                        importantly, in the Middle East, the Far East, and in Africa.</p>
                    <p>“As has been noted, financial considerations often make it necessary for
                            <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts to program the young and
                        less well known artists rather than the more established ones. And even in
                        many of these instances, it is necessary for the artist to accept a smaller
                        honorarium than would be the case under normal commercial arrangements. A
                        greater willingness on the part of artists to do this would increase
                        programming opportunities considerably for <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> posts.</p>
                    <p>“Present arrangements with the Smithsonian Institution call for six art
                        exhibitions to be sent abroad for Agency purposes during the coming year.
                        Twice that number would be more representative. And as with performing
                        artists, it is certainly desirable that ways be found to accommodate the
                        increasing demand for exposure to American art in developing areas,
                        especially in Africa. Climatic conditions, storage, freight costs, and
                        logistical programs have militated against this in the past.</p>
                    <pb facs="0404" n="352" xml:id="pg_352"/>
                    <p>“In connection with art exhibitions, it would greatly enhance their impact if
                        artists were able to travel with them and to establish contact with
                        audiences, especially with their own creative counterparts and with
                        indigenous intellectuals. Although such an idea would be exactly suited to
                        one man shows, it would be feasible also even when a variety of works is on
                        display.</p>
                    <p>“A further and direct contribution to the graphic arts—and also assistance to
                            <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts—would be the purchase of
                        original paintings and sculpture for permanent display in <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> centers abroad. Works of this kind could
                        also be placed in the homes of officers. These two outlets offer excellent
                        possibilities for acquainting foreign audiences with the wealth of creative
                        vision among American artists. This might be a program comparable to a
                        similar one in aid of the arts during the Depression years.</p>
                    <p>“Along these same lines, it might be possible to have a number of young
                        American artists (including those in the graphic arts) to remain for
                        extended periods in foreign countries working with students while learning
                        aspects of the arts of the host countries. The idea would be especially
                        adaptable to less developed countries, where the artists would teach as well
                        as work or study. This might be a kind of artistic Peace Corps.</p>
                    <p>“A matter of some importance to media branches in the Agency, especially to
                        the Voice of America and to our Film and Television Service, is that of
                        recording performances or parts of performances for use in programs abroad.
                        The Agency was denied recording rights at the opening of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> Center. There was world-wide
                        interest in this event. It had historic significance. <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s media should have been permitted to
                        record it for contemporary overseas audiences and for posterity.</p>
                    <p>“In order to avoid this type of problem in the future, it would be helpful if
                        the National Endowment for the Arts and similar government granting bodies
                        would write into their grants the requirement that the Agency have
                        recording, film, and video tape rights for non-commercial educational and/or
                        informational use overseas.” (Ibid.)</p>

                        analysis of the foreign <pb facs="0413" n="361" xml:id="pg_361"/> student
                        situation, with a request for recommendations to the Under Secretaries’
                        Committee.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">PROBLEM</p>
                    <p>What policy and objectives should govern U.S. Government involvement with
                        foreign students in the United States? To what extent should there be—or
                        appear to be—“manipulation”, or “exploitation”, or “use” of the visiting
                        students? To what extent should the U.S. Government altruistically assist or
                        arrange services for foreign students? Where do the “mutual interests” of
                        students and government coincide? What options are open to Government action
                        or restraint?</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">DISCUSSION</p>
                    <p>The number of foreign students studying in the U.S., now estimated at
                        144,000, has increased 75% in the last five years. Foreign students
                        sponsored by the U.S. Government account for less than 10% of the total.
                        There is no indication that these sharply rising numbers will decrease or
                        even level off in the future.</p>
                    <p>This has taken place at a time of increased militancy on U.S. campuses and
                        when pressures on already crowded facilities are making it increasingly
                        difficult for universities to give special attention to foreign student
                        problems and needs. In California, where the concentration of foreign
                        students is great, financial pressures have resulted in the elimination of
                        budget items for foreign student advisers in the state colleges.</p>
                    <p>Although there has been no comprehensive study of the impact that studying in
                        the U.S. has on this generation of foreign students, preliminary research
                        indicates that those from less developed parts of the world, i.e., Asia,
                        Latin America and Africa, generally tend to be isolated or alienated from
                        campus life and activities. There are fewer persons to turn to for
                        assistance or advice on academic or personal problems, and only limited
                        efforts being made by universities or surrounding communities to broaden
                        their experiences and integrate them more fully into American life. It is
                        questioned whether under these circumstances foreign students can return
                        home with an adequate understanding of the dynamics of the American
                        political and social system. Specifically, are they able to comprehend that
                        the turmoil and dissent they have witnessed here can be accommodated within
                        the U.S. system without fear of revolution or disintegration; or are they
                        likely to return home to encourage such activity in their own
                        less-accommodating nations; or are they likely to go home with primarily
                        negative opinions about the course of events in the United States?</p>
                    <p>Although the U.S. Government has long realized the educational and personal
                        benefits, for both Americans and foreigners, of having <pb facs="0414"
                            n="362" xml:id="pg_362"/> foreign students on American campuses, both
                        for them and their American counterparts, little has been done to come to
                        grips with what policy and objectives should govern U.S. Government concern
                        with the mass of non-sponsored as well as sponsored foreign students, or
                        with the complexity of the problems confronting them.</p>
                    <p>It is a fair assumption that a significant number of future foreign leaders
                        in many fields will have studied in the United States, particularly those
                        from less developed areas of the world. This was pointed out at a recent
                        meeting of members of U.S. Mission Youth Committee members from Mexico and
                        Central America. In discussing problems in identifying and establishing
                        relationships with potential leaders from those countries, the group
                        consensus was that much of the future leadership either is now or will be
                        studying in the United States and that the period of their stay here is the
                        time to have maximum impact on them.</p>
                    <p>Government responsibility for foreign students now rests primarily with the
                        Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (<gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>). The present administration of <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> has placed a high priority on assistance to
                        non-sponsored students, in addition to selecting and directly sponsoring a
                        number of foreign students. Funds are used to promote better orientation
                        programs for foreign students after arrival in the U.S., better university
                        understanding of the problems and potential of foreign students, better
                        advisory services, and improved overseas counseling on both academic and
                        non-academic matters. Fiscal Year 1971 funding on these programs was
                        $717,940, more than a 50 per cent increase over the prior year, and a
                        further increase is expected in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1972.
                        Although other government agencies are interested in foreign students, and a
                        few (primarily the Agency for International Development) directly sponsor
                        foreign students, <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> makes the only known
                        federal government financial contribution to programs for non-sponsored
                        students.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here are the Summary of Options; the Summary of Recommendations; and
                        the Options portion of the paper, separated into three sections: A. Target

                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">A. Target Group</hi></p>
                    <p>The question of target group is a complex one. The subcommittee feels that
                        the level of general services and concern for the large mass of foreign
                        students is badly deficient, and further that there is really no way that
                        the U.S. Government can or should avoid some degree of responsibility for
                        all foreign students in the country, as set forth in Option 1.</p>
                    <pb facs="0415" n="363" xml:id="pg_363"/>
                    <p>On the other hand, it is clear that primary emphasis will have to be placed,
                        as set forth in Option 2, on those foreign students the government itself
                        sponsors, for whom it has already made a substantial financial investment.
                        The Government uses elaborate selection techniques to obtain these students
                        and usually has specific purposes in mind when the grants are made—whether
                        related to possible future support of U.S. foreign policy or simply ensuring
                        that coming leaders in key sectors of their societies have realistic views
                        of the United States, good educational backgrounds, and the beginnings of
                        strong international ties in their substantive fields. Since they have been
                        chosen as the best people available, these students should be receiving
                        prime attention. This proposition may also be stated in the converse. If an
                        analysis of Government-sponsored students shows that they are <hi
                            rend="italic">not</hi> potential leaders in their sectors of society,
                        that they are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the “cream of the crop”, then the
                        U.S. Government is wasting a substantial sum of money.</p>
                    <p>Granted the desirability of the improvement of services to all foreign
                        students, the real question that is forced into the open is the extent to
                        which active government involvement and concern should exist <hi
                            rend="italic">beyond</hi> the 10 per cent who are government-sponsored.
                        Specifically, should the U.S. Government seek to identify—by group or
                        individually—a set of <hi rend="italic">non-sponsored</hi> foreign students
                        whom it will seek to assist, promote, and/or influence? Or is the
                        “government manipulation” that is implied in this sufficient reason in
                        itself to leave them alone?</p>
                    <p>The subcommittee realizes that overt U.S. Government interest in foreign
                        students who are “tagged” as potential leaders is politically very
                        sensitive, as outlined in the discussion of Project No. 5,<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d141fn4">According to the Summary of Options section on Project
                            Possibilities, Project No. 5 is the “Systematic Identification of
                            Potential Leaders.”</note> and that methods for such determinations are
                        neither very sophisticated nor reliable at this stage. Nevertheless, it
                        believes that efforts must be made in this direction, using any resulting
                        “list” in a manner that is determined to be appropriate under the cautionary
                        procedures that are suggested under that project. Of the project
                        possibilities set forth in the paper, such usage might include No. 4 on
                        pre-departure English-language and tutoring assistance, No. 7 on
                        post-arrival language-training and orientation and No. 11 on invitations to
                        conferences.</p>
                    <p>The subcommittee specifically rejects Target Group Option 4 on the limiting
                        of the number of foreign students in the U.S. While the U.S. Government
                        might concern itself, as in Project No. 2, with improving the ability of
                        U.S. universities to select top-quality foreign students, the subcommittee
                        believes that any other overt action relating to limit<pb facs="0416"
                            n="364" xml:id="pg_364"/>ing numbers would have negative repercussions.
                        In fact, it believes that more thought should be given to attracting
                        students from countries not now well represented in the U.S.</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">B. Project Possibilities</hi></p>
                    <p>The project possibilities listed in this paper fall into three broad
                        categories: (1) those that promote the support of U.S. foreign policy by
                        foreign students, (2) those that seek to ensure a quality educational
                        experience for visiting students, and (3) those that seek to broaden and
                        make more realistic the foreign students’ view of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Only one of the possible projects relates directly to support of U.S. foreign
                        policy—No. 13 on Government Liaison with Foreign Student Organizations.
                        However, furtherance of support for foreign policy can be expected to come
                        about indirectly through projects aimed basically at improved education and
                        a realistic overall U.S. experience. For if the foreign student’s experience
                        within the U.S. is constructive and useful, there may be expected in turn a
                        favorable disposition towards the United States. The recent <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>
                        Country Program Memorandum for France makes this point well: “It is
                        particularly necessary to emphasize the paradox that the political benefits
                        of such exchanges are increased by a thoroughly non-political administration
                        of the program. While generally true of cultural programming, this principle
                        is especially important in the student area, and explains the extraordinary
                        prestige and success of the <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1"
                            >Fulbright</persName> program.”</p>
                    <p>This raises the basic question of whether the direct quest for foreign policy
                        support may not be too risky and whether equal results might not be obtained
                        in a more subtle manner while other specific benefits are being achieved. In
                        terms of this paper, the subcommittee believes that Project No. 13 can be
                        undertaken without harm to overall purposes, but that it be begun with the
                        utmost care and sensitivity to potential problems.</p>
                    <p>The subcommittee recommends that all of the other proposed projects be
                        undertaken as resources permit, in the following priority order:</p>

                    <p>The emphasis in all projects should be on (1) providing a full understanding
                        of the United States, through maximum exposure to a variety of American
                        institutions and ideals and through other techniques that will help remove
                        stereotypes and misconceptions about the U.S., and (2) helping students
                        minimize their personal difficulties while achieving their own educational
                        goals. While the Government should concern itself as well with the quality
                        of education that foreign students are receiving—for low-quality training of
                        future leaders will only work to the detriment of the United States—the
                        action on these matters must be left to individual universities and private
                        agencies while the Government role remains one of encouragement and
                        facilitation.</p>
                    <p>Above all, the subcommittee recommends that the Government capitalize on its
                        experience thus far. Without being blatantly political and without intruding
                        into the lives of students or the operations of universities and private
                        agencies, the Government has had an effective program. Before departing from
                        this low-key method of operation, it should give serious and measured
                        thought.</p>
                    <p>Finally, on funding: It is clear that little can be done with any of these
                        projects unless more funds are available. There is the feeling that Congress
                        would probably not be receptive to requests for more funds to be used in
                        this indirect manner. However, the statistics raise some interesting
                        questions. <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> now spends in the neighborhood
                        of $6,000,000 annually for the support of about 3,500 directly-sponsored
                        foreign students. It spends slightly over $700,000 for programs related to
                        the estimated 144,000 non-sponsored students. In terms of relations with
                        potential leadership, what is the impact of direct sponsorship of this tiny
                        fraction of the foreign students in this country? Might not the
                        “cost/benefit” be improved by cutting off or greatly reducing direct
                        sponsorship and putting the $6 million to work on the non-sponsored
                        potential leadership that is already here? What would be the effect on our
                        policy goals? What would be the reactions of Congress, the binational
                        commissions, foreign governments? Would the dangers of government
                        manipulation and exploitation of private students, discussed elsewhere in
                        this paper, be enhanced? These are important questions, too complex for full
                        analysis here. But we think they should be raised <pb facs="0418" n="366"
                            xml:id="pg_366"/> and faced, and explored further. The number of foreign
                        students is up, and the overall available funding is down. Perhaps it is
                        time to change a traditional method of operation.</p>

                    <p>The subcommittee recommends adoption of all four organizational changes.
                        Those regarding <gloss target="#t_NAFSA_1">NAFSA</gloss>, other private
                        agencies, and a new association of foreign students, must of necessity be
                        undertaken with due care and sensitivity to the relationship of Government
                        to the private sector, and especially with regard to the need for a
                        continuation of a long-standing and constructive partnership with <gloss
                            target="#t_NAFSA_1">NAFSA</gloss>. However, the encouragement of
                        substantially more private involvement in this field is essential to
                        overcome and avoid the extensive fears of many foreign students of
                        behind-the-scenes manipulation by the U.S. Government.</p>
                    <p>The subcommittee believes that the expanded office in State <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> can be achieved with a minimum of disruption
                        and a maximum of benefit. The structure should be designed so that, as
                        expertise and experience improve, graduated increases in level and
                        complexity of programs can be accommodated readily into the system. However,
                            <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> must be left to work out this shift
                        within its own priorities and its own staff and financial capabilities.</p>

                        Programs</p>
                    <p>I. At the youth meetings for Mexico-Central America and for East Asia, we
                        discussed the desirability of changing the emphasis of State-<gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> youth programs from students to young
                        university graduates <pb facs="0419" n="367" xml:id="pg_367"/> who have
                        already taken the first step up their chosen career ladders. At the
                        Singapore and Tokyo conferences there was general support for this idea,
                        with <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Seoul dissenting. The
                        Mexico-Central America meeting produced no consensus on the question. The
                        policy issues involved are of sufficient importance to merit top-level
                        attention within <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>II. Why should we de-emphasize students?</p>
                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Vast numbers of students</hi>. World university
                        enrollments have doubled in the past decade and continue to grow at a high
                        rate. It becomes increasingly difficult to single out the real leaders from
                        this student mass.</p>
                    <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Decline of student organizations</hi>. In some countries
                        where student political organizations once existed, the rise of
                        authoritarian regimes has led to their elimination or decay, e.g.,
                        Argentina, Brazil, Greece. Talented students thus have fewer structural
                        frameworks within which to demonstrate their leadership potential.</p>
                    <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Difficulty in predicting a student’s future
                            influence</hi>. Students who look good today may fade tomorrow, while
                        today’s obscure student may be tomorrow’s Prime Minister. Unfortunately, we
                        don’t know enough about the probabilities of a student leader becoming a
                        national leader—a substantial research effort on this question would be well
                        worthwhile.</p>
                    <p>D. <hi rend="italic">Scarcity of <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                            resources</hi>. Recent reductions in personnel and budget leave us
                        little choice but to narrow the scope of our youth activities. As our
                        resources dwindle, the demands on students’ attention from competing
                        information sources continue to increase.</p>
                    <p>E. <hi rend="italic">Difficulty in changing student attitudes</hi>. Even if
                        potential leaders among students could be accurately identified, it is
                        extraordinarily difficult to achieve significant and lasting modifications
                        in their political attitudes. You can achieve substantial attitude change
                        that is short-lived, e.g., from a visit to the U.S., and you can achieve a
                        modest attitude change that is permanent, e.g., from long-term, in-country
                        exposure to seminars, personal contacts, and high-quality media products.
                        Except for rare cases, you cannot—and we do not—achieve both. Indeed, I
                        believe our dimension of time and resources in influencing students has
                        frequently been way out of line with the return. Why?</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Influence of environment and reference groups</hi>. The
                        political and intellectual climate of universities frequently encourages
                        leftist, anti-establishment and anti-American attitudes. Peer groups of
                        student leaders are often even more radical in their viewpoints; group norms
                        place individual students under considerable pressure to conform in both
                        thought and action. Even if individual students are impressed by <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> efforts, it is almost impossible for
                        them to maintain attitudes which diverge significantly from those of their
                        reference group.</p>
                    <pb facs="0420" n="368" xml:id="pg_368"/>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Early formation of attitudes</hi>. The student program
                        is frequently defended on the grounds that we should reach potential leaders
                        when they are young and thus, presumably, more easily influenced. However,
                        there is considerable evidence, supported both by scholarly research and
                        experience of <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> officers, that a
                        person’s basic value structure is already well formed before he reaches
                        university age. This is true of all persons, whether they go to college or
                        not, but it appears to be especially true of university student leaders. The
                        young activist is often politically-experienced and leftist-oriented at the
                        high school level. One might argue that we should concentrate on secondary
                        school students, but, for reasons noted above, this would be a
                        near-impossible task.</p>
                    <p>III. In contrast, the potential leader in his late 20’s or 30’s is easier to
                        identify, is usually functioning in a less radical environment, and is often
                        easier to deal with. He may be a leftist, suspicious of the United States.
                        His basic attitudes may be beyond influencing. But this does not mean we
                        cannot program for such people. The key is to establish areas of mutual
                        interest within which the potential leader and <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> have a logical reason to maintain personal and
                        professional contact. If our programs are structured properly, the young
                        professional will view them as directly useful in his career area. Students
                        will often perceive the same program as mere imperialist propaganda. While
                        desirable, it is not imperative for a person to like, or even to understand,
                        the United States in order for us profitably to work with him. America deals
                        every day with governments and political groups that waste little love on
                        us. The practiced goal of our youth program should not be to convert people,
                        but to try to show them where it is <hi rend="italic">in their own
                            interest</hi> to work with us—or, at least, to coexist with us.</p>
                    <p>IV. Overseas posts continually ask for more guidance from Washington on the
                        youth program. I suggest we formulate a policy memo along the above lines
                        and send it to the field with the suggestion that they implement it to the
                        extent local conditions permit.</p>

                    <quote><p>a. The poignancy of the film arouses not only deep sympathy for the
                            plight of the Tibetans but also revulsion against the Chinese for the
                            brutality with which they tightened their grip on Tibet, oppressed its
                            people, and suppressed its culture. While we do not want to appear as
                            having gone “soft” on Chinese Communism neither do we want to appear
                            anti-Chinese or anti-Peking.</p>
                        <p>b. The effect of the narration, indeed the total effect of the film is to
                            portray Tibet as having been an independent country, a nation whose
                            sovereignty was violated by the Chinese. This is the line taken by the
                            Dalai Lama (clipping enclosed),<note n="3" xml:id="d143fn3">Not attached
                                or further identified.</note> but our Government, as noted by
                            Cordell Hull in 1941, has never recognized the independence of Tibet.
                            Rather, we have consistently held that Tibet is an autonomous area under
                            Chinese sovereignty (a claim on which Taipei and Peking agree). This
                            coincides with the position of the Government of India which affords the
                            Dalai Lama safe haven in exile, but does not recognize his
                            government.</p>

                        <p>c. To the best of our knowledge the film represents a new departure. We
                            are unaware that such a film has been done in the past several years.
                            Its appearance at this juncture therefore might well be interpreted by
                            Peking as a new signal of basic hostility, of American challenge to
                            Peking’s claims regarding China’s territorial integrity, of long-term
                            support for the Tibetans’ desire to “liberate” Tibet from Chinese
                            control. These are not the signals which we wish to project. Rather we
                            must work within the spirit of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"

                                target="#d143fn2">footnote 2, Document 143</ref>.</note> or a point
                        for the conversations during the President’s visit.</p>
                    <p>Two or three top Chinese scholars of the United States could be invited to
                        join the fellowship program of the Wilson Center. I think we could probably
                        take better care of them here and give them a better understanding of the
                        American system of government than would be the case almost anywhere else.
                        In almost any university setting they are likely to be lionized or picketed,
                        and if they had any genuine desire to learn about the United States
                        Government, the information they would be apt to get and contacts and
                        appointments they could make would be secondary by comparison. The “men of
                        letters and men of affairs” they would be joining would be distinguished and
                        international in makeup—the latest list of appointments is attached. If they
                        chose scholars in the fields of international affairs or environment, they
                        would find themselves in particularly knowledgeable company, although I
                        would think a general invitation to scholars interested in studying our
                        system would be most acceptable. We would have maximum flexibility in being
                        able to receive them on short or no notice and for any length of stay
                        desired, since we are a year-round center, not operating on an academic
                        calendar, and there are no fixed lengths of appointment.</p>
                    <p>If this makes sense, Henry, let me know and we can pursue it further. I am
                        confident the other Board members would think it a highly worthwhile action,
                        and needless to say, I would give such an effort top personal attention.</p>

                    <p>There follows a summary of the report and recommendations:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">I.</hi> REVIEW OF PRESENT
                        PROGRAMS</p>
                    <p>A. There is presently no overall consideration of our exchange programs.
                        These 300 exchange programs and projects are conceived and managed
                        separately by eighteen agencies.</p>
                    <p>B. Total annual cost of Government exchange programs (including <gloss
                            target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, State, Defense, Peace Corps, <gloss
                            target="#t_HEW_1">HEW</gloss>, National Science Foundation, Department
                        of Agriculture, <gloss target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss> and others) is about
                        $500 million.</p>
                    <p>C. Country emphasis varies with little or no relationship to overall foreign
                        relations criteria.</p>
                    <p>D. Country exchange programs vary widely in the professional groups they
                        engage, and give minimal attention to political consequences.</p>
                    <p>E. Follow-up activities with exchanges are generally inadequate. Most
                        agencies suffer from some lack of information about past program
                        participants.</p>
                    <p>F. There is some duplication among programs. There is also omission and
                        underrepresentation of some significant groups in the total U.S. exchange
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>G. Private sector programs (e.g. voluntary organizations, educational
                        institutions and corporations) constitute a large proportion of total U.S.
                        exchange activity. Public and private sector programs would mutually benefit
                        from even a modest degree of increased cooperation and even a rudimentary
                        system for the exchange of information.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">II.</hi> REVIEW OF LEADERSHIP
                        DIMENSION</p>
                    <p>A. Current exchange activity is programmed to achieve specific agency
                        objectives. Concern for a leadership dimension is most evident in the
                        programs of Defense and State.</p>
                    <p>B. U.S. missions are capable of identifying and ranking the major groupings
                        and institutions from which leaders come.</p>
                    <p>C. It is possible to focus programs on the institutional structures that
                        produce and influence leaders.</p>
                    <p>D. Better coordination, planning, review and analysis in the overseas
                        missions, supported by a Washington interdepartmental review <pb facs="0427"
                            n="375" xml:id="pg_375"/> mechanism, could significantly enhance the
                        leadership dimension of many exchange programs.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">III.</hi> CONCLUSIONS</p>
                    <p>A. Present U.S. Government exchange programs provide ample scope to achieve
                        U.S. objectives, including an increase in emphasis on leadership.</p>
                    <p>B. Relatively modest additional resources may be warranted for exchanges with
                        a high potential to influence leaders.</p>
                    <p>C. Within existing U.S. exchange objectives, and for an increased leadership
                        dimension, the scope of present authorizing legislation appears to be
                        basically adequate.</p>
                    <p>D. Present systems are inadequate to provide the needed degree of
                        coordination, planning, review and analysis of U.S. exchange activity, with
                        or without an increased leadership dimension.</p>
                    <p>E. There is a vital need for the centralized data gathering and analysis of
                        information on U.S. programs in order to:</p>
                    <p>(1) identify and review the government-wide distribution of program resources
                        and evaluate program results;</p>
                    <p>(2) eliminate overlap and inefficiencies in programs;</p>
                    <p>(3) reexamine and periodically review country and professional group emphasis
                        in the context of current U.S. foreign policy interests.</p>

                    <p>The memorandum from the Deputy Secretary of Defense raises a large number of
                        points that basically advance two notions: (1) the lack of individual
                        treatment and analysis of Defense programs leads to erroneous and
                        unsubstantiated conclusions and, (2) the need for a new coordination
                        mechanism has not been established, and a proper review of Defense programs
                        would lead to different conclusions.</p>
                    <p>Comment:</p>
                    <p>The report provides a synthesis of a substantial volume of supporting
                        materials and studies covering the programs of 18 agencies (see pp. 51–53);
                        brevity precludes lengthy treatment of each agency’s individual programs.
                        Also, it was not the purpose of this study to weigh the relative merits of
                        the various programs.</p>
                    <p>To eliminate Government-wide overlaps and inefficiencies, the supporting
                        studies evidence a need for improved coordination (i) between Washington and
                        the field, and (ii) between the agencies themselves. Only a central entity
                        can effectively respond to the need for <pb facs="0428" n="376"
                            xml:id="pg_376"/> organized and standardized periodic program planning,
                        review and analysis.</p>
                    <p>The study recommends only increased and centralized coordination, planning,
                        review, and analysis. What is suggested is intended to complement—not
                        interfere with—individual agency responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>In particular, the relationship of military assistance training to the
                        national security of the United States requires that decisions such as which
                        countries receive training in what amounts, the types of training required
                        and priorities for such training continue to be made by the Departments of
                        State and Defense acting together for the total political/military interests
                        of the United States. However, coordination of military assistance training
                        with other Government-wide exchange programs is needed for general
                        information, advice, evaluation and planning purposes.</p>

                    <p>The reply from the Deputy Administrator of <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                            >AID</gloss> expresses concern about (1) the scope of the leadership
                        definition in relation to his Agency’s program, (2) the misleading
                        inferences that arise from the use of statistical data and (3) his belief
                        that the coordination function can best be achieved by placing it outside
                        the National Security Council decision-making system. <gloss
                            target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, however, favors the objectives of more
                        complete data-gathering and information analysis capacity, better programs,
                        improved policy guidance and a means to provide these elements.</p>
                    <p>Comment:</p>
                    <p>While we believe that the definition of leadership used in this study
                        provides a reasonable analytical tool, the matter of the scope of the
                        definition of leadership should be an early agenda item for any coordinating
                        body. The point raised about the use of data would be valid if this were the
                        only method of analysis used to develop study material. However, it would
                        have required too extensive a volume to have dealt with the material
                        developed in over 300 interviews. A statistical presentation was the most
                        reasonable way to present the complex material in a succinct manner. A
                        coordinating group with a supporting staff would have the capacity to
                        develop the individual program issues and make decisions in a more finite
                        manner. The concern about the relationship of sensitive exchange programs to
                        the National Security System is also the concern of <gloss target="#t_HEW_1"
                            >HEW</gloss>, Peace Corps, and <gloss target="#t_OST_1">OST</gloss> for
                        the science community, and leads all of them to choose Option D which would
                        place authority for coordination in the Secretary of State, rather than in
                        an Interagency Group.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">IV.</hi> RECOMMENDATIONS</p>
                    <p>Recommendation 1:</p>
                    <p>To achieve maximum benefit to the United States from its exchange programs,
                        steps should be taken to assure more effective coordination, planning,
                        review, and analysis of the total effort.<note n="7" xml:id="d145fn7">The
                            President did not approve or disapprove any of the recommendations. For
                            his decision regarding the report, see <ref target="#d154">Document
                                154</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>Recommendation 2:</p>
                    <p>The United States should place selective increased emphasis on influencing
                        foreign leadership through the use of exchange programs.</p>
                    <p>Recommendation 3:</p>
                    <p>The study report also concludes that State’s academic exchange program and
                        the educational training programs of <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                        need further analysis, sharper definition and perhaps joint management. The
                        Department of State in conjunction with the Agency for International
                        Development will undertake this review which will be completed by January 1,
                        1972.</p>
                    <p>Recommendation 4:</p>
                    <p>The responsibility for coordination, planning, review and analysis of U.S.
                        exchange programs can be assigned to:</p>
                    <p>(A) each agency individually; or</p>
                    <p>(B) an existing coordinating organization; or</p>
                    <p>(C) a full or part-time Special Assistant to the President; or</p>
                    <p>(D) the Secretary of State; or</p>
                    <p>(E) a new coordinating organization, an <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                        Inter-departmental Exchange Group reporting to the Under Secretaries
                        Committee</p>
                    <p>(Analysis of options pp. 37–42)</p>
                    <p>The difficulty with option A is that no single agency has sufficient
                        information or point of view to carry out its programs in reasonable
                        relationship to those of the eighteen other agencies. There is no present
                        interagency body with sufficient scope or relationship to a decision-making
                        system to make option B a practical alternative. A Special Assistant to the
                        President as suggested in option C adds an additional organizational layer
                        which will tend to confuse regular lines of agency authority and is best
                        reserved for those Governmental functions that do not fit within present
                        agency structures. With respect to the recommended options D and E, the
                        agencies differ on the degree to which their exchangees would be sensitive
                        to any political overtones in a coordinating and planning mechanism. The
                        Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the Agency for International
                        Development, the <pb facs="0430" n="378" xml:id="pg_378"/> Office of Science
                        and Technology for the science agencies, and the Peace Corps (now <gloss
                            target="#t_ACTION_1">ACTION</gloss>) would favor placing the authorities
                        in the Secretary of State where they believe such overtones would be less
                        than in the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> system: The Department of
                        State favors option E because the coordinating mechanism would be related to
                        a regular decision-making process. Further, not all agencies need be members
                        of a coordinating body and the most directly concerned agencies—State,
                        Defense, <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss>—are members of the Under Secretaries Committee. All
                        eighteen agencies should, of course, be required to furnish data and provide
                        reports to the coordinating body.</p>
                    <p>To achieve better coordination, planning, review and analysis of U.S.
                        Government exchange programs:</p>
                    <p>(a) Place the required authority in the Secretary of State,</p>
                    <p>OR</p>
                    <p>(b) establish a new Inter-departmental Exchange Group (<gloss
                            target="#t_IG_1">IG</gloss>) reporting to the Under Secretaries
                        Committee</p>
                    <p>Recommendation 5:</p>
                    <p>To achieve a better relationship between U.S. Government programs and those
                        of private organizations and to benefit from any established U.S. Government
                        coordinating mechanism, a private International Exchange Council should be
                        formed as a catalyst between the two sectors. The Council should be composed
                        of seven members from private life and the Secretary of State and the
                        Administrator of the Agency for International Development.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName> takes the view that
                        Peking’s radio and newspaper services have continued to attack the Nixon
                        administration and its policies with “unabated intensity” since the
                        announcement of the proposed meeting, and therefore it makes “little sense
                        for us to refrain from focusing the attention of the world’s peoples on the
                        nature and historical acts of the men in power in Peking.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName> does not mention that
                        the one point which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD_1">Brown</persName>
                        and I focused on as the primary reason for not issuing the <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> film at this time was that there have
                        been virtually no references to Tibet in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> output for some years. We had no objection to keeping up
                        the regular <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> output on Communist
                        China, but considered that something new such as the <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> film—which, incidentally, is a very
                        effective presentation—would be raising the decibel count considerably in
                        our propaganda exchanges with Peking. The use made of the film by <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Public Affairs Officers could, in fact,
                        amount to a very high profile action on our part.</p>

                        which points out that there has been a distinct absence of Chinese Communist

                        seems obvious that the Chinese are making some effort to improve the climate

                    <p>A one-hour film entitled VIETNAM! VIETNAM! dealing with aspects of the
                        Vietnamese War during the decade of the 60’s has been completed and is
                        available to the field posts. The film uses a cutoff point of December 31,
                        1969 on events relating to the war. Since many significant and well-known
                        developments occurred after that date, this production must be considered
                        basically archival. It is not really suited for dealing with the
                        contemporary scene.<note n="2" xml:id="d148fn2">In a June 10 article in the

                            indicated that it would ‘definitely’ not be offered for television or
                            theater showings to foreign audiences.” He continued: “It was reliably

                            political considerations, now raised doubts on the film’s value as

                    <p>We recently sent a print of the film to several selected PAOs in diverse

                        and asked for their private assessment on its usefulness in their situation.
                        Most felt that Viet-Nam was no longer a major attitudinal factor and that a
                        production dealing with earlier events in the war was not presently useful.
                        At least one, however, felt the film would be quite helpful.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_SCE_1">Southard</persName> requested that PAOs
                            report any “significant changes in attitudes of the overseas Chinese” in
                            their respective countries “if any, which have resulted from recent
                            developments.” He concluded: “It would be useful to point out whether
                            Peking is making any deliberate effort to influence the overseas Chinese
                            and what, if anything, the Agency (or <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                                >USIS</gloss> Hong Kong) should do.”</note> The predominant mood is
                        apolitical, seeking to be neutral, and concerned with economic and trade
                        problems rather than strong ideological convictions. But there are variables
                        within this attitude, depending in varying degrees on host government’s
                        foreign policy, on Peking’s attitudes, and on age groups.</p>
                    <p>Although the overseas Chinese appear proud of the achievements of Peking,
                        they are reluctant to accept communist political and economic models.
                        Because of their control of much of the trade and commerce in the region,
                        their role in the life and stability of SE Asia is important—and they often
                        influence political decisions. Thus, we are compelled to take a very close
                        look at the overseas Chinese as a <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                        audience.</p>
                    <p>To this end, on December 2, we will hold a working session on this subject.

                        developments. From this session we hope to shed light on the role of <gloss

                        <quote><p>In countries where Peking does not have diplomatic ties and where
                                there is a significant Chinese population, such as Malaysia (4
                                million), Singapore (2 million) and Indonesia (3–4 million), the
                                general overseas Chinese attitude toward the recent thaw in <gloss

                                in some cases even euphoric. The Singapore <gloss target="#t_PAO_1"
                                    >PAO</gloss> described the pro-Peking atmosphere as overwhelming

                                the left.</p>
                            <p>It is apparent that the emotional pull of China (but not necessarily
                                the ideological one) has had a direct effect on overseas Chinese
                                communities, more so now than 5 or 10 years ago. Many now express a
                                sense of pride in Peking’s accomplishments and view <gloss

                                emotional attachment to what they consider their “homeland,” a
                                disproportionately large number of overseas Chinese feel proud that
                                China is finally emerging into the world as a great power. It should
                                be noted that the younger Chinese do not have a strongly sentimental
                                attachment, as do the old, for China, but there is still pride in
                                being Chinese, and in what they see as the accomplishments of
                                Peking.</p>
                            <p>This growing attitude has provoked increasing host government concern
                                over the growth of Chinese chauvinism. While increasing <gloss
                                    target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> influence in the region is a
                                growing possibility, host governments—e.g. Thailand—feel that such
                                an influence would foster a potential subversive threat to their
                                security.</p>
                            <p>Although some progress has been made toward developing a multi-racial
                                society and nationhood in Thailand and Malaysia, Chinese allegiance
                                to their adopted countries in some cases is still questionable. One
                                indication is their continued preference for the Chinese language
                                and culture.</p>
                            <pb facs="0439" n="387" xml:id="pg_387"/>
                            <p>In Singapore and Malaysia, a vast system of Chinese schools still
                                exists. The majority of Chinese in these countries, whether they are
                                called Singaporeans or Malaysians, continue to receive their primary
                                education predominantly in Chinese Mandarin. A large, if somewhat
                                timid, Chinese-language press continues to flourish in all SEAsian
                                countries, except Burma.</p>
                            <p>In contrast to the above, a segment of the overseas Chinese
                                communities remains rabidly anti-communist and still maintains close

                                segment, as illustrated by the expressions of Chinese editors and
                                publishers at the recent Chinese Language Press Institute meeting in
                                San Francisco, showed bitterness and resentment toward U.S. policy,
                                which in their minds had caused <gloss target="#t_GRC_1"
                                >GRC</gloss>’s present predicament.</p>
                            <p>There is a certain ambivalence in attitude among the overseas
                                Chinese, especially among the younger Chinese, toward mainland
                                China. While they seem proud of what Mao has accomplished on the
                                mainland and of what they view as the resurgence of China as a major
                                world power, they would not want to live in China because of the
                                difficult economic conditions and the regimented nature of life. The
                                communist prescription for government and economic organization,
                                which envisaged a high level of regimentation, does not seem to fit
                                into the freer environment to which overseas Chinese are now
                                accustomed.</p>
                            <p>Overseas Chinese attitudes toward the mainland, especially in
                                countries with a neutral orientation, will depend to some extent on
                                Peking’s attitude toward them. In recent months, Peking appeared to
                                be more interested in establishing bilateral government relations
                                than in cultivation of the overseas Chinese.</p>
                            <p>For example, Chou En-lai, in his interview with the Malaysian trade
                                delegation, reportedly denigrated the local Chinese and indicated
                                that they should make more of an effort to fit in with the local
                                culture.</p>
                            <p>In the near future, normalization of relations between the <gloss
                                    target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and several neutral-type countries
                                in SEAsia will depend on <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                                agreement to and adherence of the principle of scrupulous
                                non-interference in internal affairs. If state-to-state relations
                                could be normalized, it is expected that increased contact between
                                Peking and the overseas Chinese would ensue, and that expansion of
                                Peking’s influence in the Chinese communities might result. With
                                lingering anxiety and suspicion, the host governments will not
                                tolerate <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> exploitation of the
                                overseas Chinese for political purposes.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile, Peking conducts its diplomacy at several levels—(1) to
                                reach accommodation with and (2) to influence various SEAsian
                                governments, and (3) to continue hostile propaganda via <gloss
                                    target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>-supported clandestine radio
                                broadcasts to Malaysia, Thailand, Burma, etc., which provide moral
                                and ideological support for the CTO and/or indigenous insurgent
                                elements. In recent months, while official Peking media have taken a
                                more conciliatory attitude toward SEAsian governments, Peking
                                continues to support rebel propaganda efforts through its
                                “unofficial” mouthpieces.</p>
                            <p>In some countries, especially anti-communist countries, there is
                                little outward, concrete evidence of substantial changes in overseas

                                genuine sentiment is difficult to show because of host government
                                surveillance. In general, they approach China questions cautiously,
                                watching which way the wind will blow. In Cambodia, Burma,
                                Indonesia, etc. a large number of the overseas Chinese have a Peking
                                rather than Taipei orientation. But the local governments have made
                                it clear that they will not tolerate resurgence of banned pro-Chicom
                                organizations.</p>
                            <p>In countries where the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> maintains
                                diplomatic relations, Peking appears to have taken a more active
                                role vis-a-vis the overseas Chinese. In Vientiane, for example, the
                                    <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> reports that <gloss
                                    target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> Embassy officials have been
                                noticeably more outgoing and genial in recent weeks, and that they
                                have increased contact work among the local Chinese, who now accept
                                such contacts and visit the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                                Embassy more freely than before. The Peking Embassy invites the
                                Chinese to weekly film showings, audiences for which have increased
                                from average of about 50 last year to over 300 currently. In Burma,
                                the Embassy also has taken up a more active role in the Chinese
                                community.</p></quote>

                        CP was committed to Embassy Moscow to nominate a fifth, and last, attraction
                        under the current 1970–71 agreement. We indicated in this connection we were
                        negotiating with the Composers’ Quartet/New York Woodwind Quintet for a
                        four-week tour during the late April–early June, 1972 period. We have
                        arrived at satisfactory terms with the Quartet/Quintet, have so informed
                        Embassy Moscow, and all indications are that the contract can be signed in
                        Moscow on December 3.</p>
                    <p>The background of negotiations for a fifth attraction has been long and
                        complicated. It is related directly to Moscow’s footdragging in connection
                        with their displeasure over <gloss target="#t_JDL_1">JDL</gloss> activities
                        against Soviet performing arts attractions here. Embassy Moscow and the
                        Department have held firmly to the principle that, regardless of what Moscow
                        may decide about sending its performing arts groups here, the U.S. is
                        entitled, under the exchanges agreement, to send a fifth attraction to the
                        U.S.S.R. We sought to send the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center on a
                        tour in December 1971–January 1972, but negotiations with Moscow broke down
                        over terms of a possible contract. The Composers’ Quartet/Woodwind Quintet,
                        highly recommended by our Music Panel, became available but only for late
                        Spring, 1972. We had no other suitable nomination.</p>

                                1</ref>.</note> The Department had indicated in an October 20
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> to President
                        memorandum (Tab A) that we were exploring the feasibility of sending an
                        outstanding performing arts group to the U.S.S.R. to coincide with the
                        President’s visit. We were subsequently informed by a November 9 <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                            >Rogers</persName> memorandum (Tab B) that it would be “perhaps a bit
                        early to take any decision . . . (on) sending a performing arts group . . .
                        to coincide with the President’s planned visit.”</p>
                    <p>In view of the foregoing, we believe it would be desirable to inform the
                        White House of current developments regarding the Quartet/Quintet tour. We
                        think the following points should be made:</p>
                    <quote><p>a) past Soviet obstinacy has prevented the Department from mounting a
                            fifth American performing arts attraction in the U.S.S.R. during the
                            1970–71 period of the current exchanges agreement;</p>
                        <p>b) as a result of our insistence on the right to present a fifth
                            attraction under the terms of the current agreement, the difficulty in
                            finding an appropriate attraction, scheduling on such short notice by
                            outstanding performers, the only time available for a group suggested by
                            our Music Panel will overlap with the President’s visit;</p>
                        <p>c) we think scheduling of the Quartet/Quintet within the U.S.S.R. can be
                            accomplished to accommodate to whatever indications we may receive from
                            the White House.</p></quote>

                        <p>The just-completed tour of the U.S.S.R. by <persName corresp="#p_ED_1"
                                >Duke Ellington</persName> and his Orchestra, under the sponsorship
                            of our Cultural Presentations Program, has been an unqualified
                            communications success. His impact on the Soviet public and officials
                            during a 35-day tour is reflected in the following results, including
                            several “firsts”:</p>
                        <p>A. The day <persName corresp="#p_ED_1">Ellington</persName> departed the
                            U.S.S.R., <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> published a remarkable, highly
                            favorable article, citing the success of the tour and praising the
                            American musicians as professionals and as individuals. This is the
                            first time in recent years that <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> has
                            acknowledged the existence in the U.S.S.R. of a U.S. performing arts
                            group.</p>
                        <p>B. Soviet authorities requested two additional concerts in Moscow to meet
                            public demand for tickets. This is the first time in recent years such a
                            request has been made. We agreed, on the condition that the additional
                            concerts would be held in Moscow’s Palace of Sports, seating 10,000.</p>
                        <p>C. Thus for the first time, a U.S. performing arts group under our
                            auspices was allowed to perform in the Palace of Sports, which had
                            already been set up for ice hockey.</p>
                        <p>D. Approximately 114,000 persons attended <persName corresp="#p_ED_1"
                                >Ellington</persName>’s 22 concerts in five cities.<note n="5"

                                Moscow. The tour began in Leningrad on September 13 and ended in
                                Moscow on October 12.</note> Audiences consisted of all age groups
                            and included high Government officials in Moscow, at least one Soviet
                            cosmonaut (Feoktistov) and poet Yevtushenko.<note n="6" xml:id="d150fn6"

                            arrived in Moscow for concerts. One traveler said: “This <pb facs="0444"
                                n="392" xml:id="pg_392"/> only happens once in a lifetime. You
                            cannot imagine the impression that <persName corresp="#p_ED_1"
                                >Ellington</persName> makes on a Soviet audience.” Tickets in Moscow
                            were being scalped for $50 each.</p>
                        <p>E. Off-stage, <persName corresp="#p_ED_1">Ellington</persName> and his
                            men met informally with many Soviet citizens, including leading
                            Ukrainian composers, local musicians and students. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ED_1">Ellington</persName> and Soviet musicians
                            conducted three jam sessions together.</p>
                        <p>F. U.S. press coverage of Soviet reaction was overwhelmingly favorable.

                    <p>Most officers overseas and many in Washington tend to develop a limited
                        focus. They concentrate on the local situation or on what is <pb facs="0446"
                            n="394" xml:id="pg_394"/> news today. They are sensitive to the foreign
                        audiences’ interests; and in their dialogues they tend to introduce only
                        those subjects which are of immediate or foremost concern to their
                        audiences.</p>
                    <p>These tendencies in many respects are praiseworthy. They can increase the
                        effectiveness of the Agency’s communication effort. But too narrow focus and
                        an over-concentration on what is locally relevant can diminish our
                        effectiveness. Our audiences’ memories are short. Modern communication,
                        dense and rapid, often presents news in isolated fragments. Agency officers
                        in Washington and in posts abroad should try to show our audiences patterns
                        of development and relate news items to these patterns.</p>
                    <p>To perform these tasks requires constant awareness by all officers of the
                        needs and resources of all the principal Agency elements and the <gloss
                            target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts. Each of us has his own job, but
                        each should also contribute to the Agency’s task worldwide. Impact in one
                        place or at one time is not enough. The most effective exploitation of news
                        and presentation of our opinions can only be achieved by the use of all
                        appropriate Agency resources, by thinking in global, strategic terms,
                        and—especially to younger audiences—by cumulative reporting which gives
                        historical perspective to developments in the 1970s.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Illustrative Cases</p>
                    <p>In recent months Agency treatment of some high priority subjects would have
                        benefitted from greater coordination of effort. In some cases coordination
                        was good in output to some parts of the world but not to others. We review a
                        few of these cases and offer suggestions for continuing treatment of current
                        priorities in the paragraphs below. Comments on the general problem of
                        coordination of media resources and on these specific subjects are
                        solicited.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Refugees from Communism.</hi> Wherever communist regimes
                        are in control they have erected administrative and physical barriers
                        against flight from their territories. This is a fact of twentieth century
                        life. It is, perhaps, the single starkest admission of communist weakness
                        and the most telling definition of the difference between us and them. It is
                        a fact which most of the non-communist world has gotten used to, or is used
                        to overlooking. From time to time, however, attempts to escape from
                        communist nation-prisons increase or are particularly dramatic; and the
                        cruel fact cannot be ignored. In the spring of 1971 escape attempts from
                        mainland China to Hong Kong rose markedly, and in the summer of 1971 there
                        was a significant increase in escape attempts from East Germany. In both
                        instances the Agency was slow to report and to cross-report the
                        developments. Inadequate exploitation of this subject is especially
                        regrettable, since such territorial jails are observable in many parts of
                        the world (Europe, Asia, Cuba).</p>

                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Viet-Nam.</hi> Over the last two years, in consonance
                        with the overall U.S. policy of Vietnamization, <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1"
                            >JUSPAO</gloss>, Agency media and <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                        posts have ceased acting on behalf of the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1"
                            >GVN</gloss> Ministry of Information in telling its story to foreign
                        audiences. The United States, of course, continues to have a strong interest
                        in seeing South Viet-Nam’s independence maintained. In most areas of the
                        world today Viet-Nam is not a prime concern to our audiences. However, in
                        the context of the Nixon Doctrine,<note n="2" xml:id="d151fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d65fn3">footnote 3, Document 65</ref>.</note> our audiences
                        in many countries may view South Viet-Nam as a test case for U.S. foreign
                        policy commitments. Agency media and <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                        posts should not talk about Viet-Nam for the general purpose of making
                        conversation. But whenever the news permits, media and posts should be alert
                        to opportunities to use the example of Viet-Nam (and those of Korea and
                        Berlin) to remind our audiences that those who refuse subjugation can—with
                        strength, determination, and the help of allies—successfully resist it.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Communist Espionage.</hi> A large number of official
                        representatives of communist states abroad are intelligence agents. At
                        times, in different countries, their activities become so blatant and
                        harmful to the security of host nations that the agents are expelled. The
                        expulsions and reasons for them are usually well publicized for a brief
                        time, until a newer sensational development takes over the headlines.
                        Usually, as in the recent Mexican and United Kingdom cases, foreign media or
                        a foreign government take the lead in publicizing the communist subversive
                        apparatus. Such events offer us important opportunities to heighten
                        awareness of the communist record worldwide by aggregating case histories of
                        communist espionage and deliberate violations of diplomatic practice.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Castro and Allende.</hi> The cases of Cuba under Castro
                        and Chile under Allende are distinct in many respects; but both cases in
                        varying degrees show repression of free expression, regimentation of
                        economic life, and attacks by Marxists-in-power on the independence of the
                        universities and the judiciary. Since the early 1960s Cuba under Castro has
                        been an Agency priority subject. Since late 1970 the Agency has used
                        factual, non-polemical cross-reporting and cross-play of comment throughout
                        Latin America to increase knowledge of developments in Chile under Allende.
                        A series of reports on Chile has gone to other parts of the world as well.
                        Agency output on Cuba and Chile may be made more relevant if Washington
                        media and <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts place developments in
                        these countries in the context of the general pattern of events wherever
                        Marxists achieve control. An important element in the Cuban story—which may
                        also become manifest in the Chilean <pb facs="0448" n="396" xml:id="pg_396"
                        /> case—is the diminution of a nation’s political independence as a result
                        of over-dependence on aid from communist states. Illustrations of this
                        phenomenon can be drawn from many parts of the world. In Agency media output
                        and <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts’ treatment of Cuba, Chile,
                        and similar situations, we should recognize that certain aspects of the
                        Castro and Allende programs are attractive to intellectuals and laborers in
                        developing areas. Media output and posts’ presentations gain in credibility
                        to developing countries’ audiences when they feature accounts by citizens of
                        developing countries who have experienced the effects of communist rule or
                        too close relations with communist states.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">U.S. Strength and the Overall Balance.</hi> Military
                        analysts and such authoritative publications as <hi rend="italic"
                            >Jane’s</hi> and the reports of the Institute of Strategic Studies in
                        recent months have stated that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is
                        overtaking the U.S. in particular categories of armament and defense
                        investment. It is important to keep our audiences aware that the U.S.
                        maintains an edge in strategic weapons delivery systems and that, overall,
                        the U.S. military posture is sufficient to our defense tasks. We must avoid
                        poor-mouthing our military capacity and thereby undermining confidence in
                        our strength and reliability. U.S. strength is an advantage to both our
                        allies and the non-aligned. Wherever the forces of the U.S. directly
                        confront those of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, nations in the
                        area of confrontation are significantly affected. It is not our desire to
                        invite confrontation, nor do we wish big power differences to intrude on the
                        peaceful development of nations in-between. It is, however, fitting for us
                        quietly to emphasize the advantages to all non-communist nations which
                        derive from U.S. strength, to bring to the attention of all non-communist
                        audiences the proven benefits of collective security (including United
                        Nations security forces actions), and to impress upon them the dangers of
                        too intimate military involvement with communist powers. Here again,
                        examples abound around the world.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Economic Interdependence.</hi> This subject has
                        dominated international relations since mid-summer. Our foreign economic
                        policy has come in for much criticism. While some of this results from
                        expected hard bargaining positions of our trading partners and specific
                        export interest groups abroad, part of the criticism stems from a lack of
                        information. The Agency is publicizing facts of everyday economic life
                        (e.g., comparative prices of consumer goods after payment of duties in
                        different countries). International fair-sharing is not yet universally
                        recognized as a useful principle, either by governments or by interest
                        groups within nations. We must hope that more information will lead to
                        greater appreciation of the U.S. position. In economic information the
                        Agency works on the two levels of sophisticated arguments for <pb
                            facs="0449" n="397" xml:id="pg_397"/> experts and popular appeals to
                        foreign consumers. Far more coordination of Agency resources is needed;
                            <gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> is seeking to provide that. The
                        Agency should also review basic policy regarding its activities on behalf of
                        U.S. commercial interests abroad. Among governments’ foreign information
                        programs, ours is unique in not devoting significant resources to export and
                        tourism promotion.</p>

                    <p>There are already some tentative indications that Soviet anti-American
                        propaganda is toning down as the influence of the impending visit begins to
                        be felt. There is every reason to assume that this process will accelerate
                        and Soviet media will become increasingly less objectionable in their
                        treatment of the United States—up to a point. While state-to-state relations
                        can ebb and flow, Soviet propaganda dogma dictates <pb facs="0450" n="398"
                            xml:id="pg_398"/> that the ideological struggle must go on. This same
                        principle is reiterated even in today’s gradually improving atmosphere.
                        While occasionally irritating, it is in our judgment a pragmatic approach to
                        which we also subscribe in our own fashion.</p>
                    <p>1) <hi rend="italic">U.S. Government media treatment of the Soviet
                        Union</hi>—The Voice of America, as the official United States Government
                        radio, pursues all reasonably attractive opportunities to expose Soviet
                        perfidy, consistent with the requirements of dignity and the official
                        responsibility of the Voice. Our broadcasts, of course, reflect the trend of
                        substantive developments in our relations. As these improve and are
                        improving, so the substance of our broadcasts will inevitably become less
                        objectionable to Soviet authorities.</p>
                    <p>2) <hi rend="italic">Jamming</hi>—A major bone of contention between
                        ourselves and the Soviets in this field since the Soviet invasion of
                        Czechoslovakia has been jamming of the Voice of America.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d152fn3">See <ref target="#d1fn3">footnote 3, Document
                            1</ref>.</note> This effort has now reached an all-out level in terms of
                        volume. Soviet transmitters are engaged in jamming our Russian, Ukrainian,
                        Georgian and Armenian broadcasts.</p>
                    <p>Jamming, in fact, is only partially effective. In major municipal centers
                        where a heavy jamming effort is mounted, effectiveness is up to 80%. It is
                        virtually completely ineffective in the countryside and even in suburbs of
                        cities like Moscow and Leningrad.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets ceased jamming <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> in 1963
                        consistent with efforts to generate a détente. They resumed with the
                        entrance of Soviet troops into Czechoslovakia. They might well terminate
                        jamming as an act of goodwill prior to the President’s visit. There are many
                        arguments against jamming. The Soviets are embarrassed by public discussion
                        of the fact that they jam; jamming is only partially effective; it is
                        expensive in terms of technical resources. However, if they have not
                        terminated jamming prior to the visit, it certainly is an irritant we would
                        hope would be raised during the visit. We will provide a detailed briefing
                        paper on this topic as the visit draws near.</p>
                    <p>3) <hi rend="italic">Radio Free Europe—Radio Liberty</hi>—While defensive
                        about their own jamming, the Soviets can be expected to be quite offensive
                        about Radio Liberty broadcasts to the Soviet Union. From our point of view,
                        we would strongly oppose terminating broadcast activities of Radio Liberty
                        (and <gloss target="#t_RFE_1">RFE</gloss>) as long as what the Soviets
                        describe as the “ideological struggle” goes on.</p>

                    <p>a) We agree with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>’
                        suggestion that we should seek air and <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss>

                            xml:id="d152fn4">In the November 10 memorandum (see <ref
                                target="#d152fn2">footnote 2</ref>, above), <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> stated: “The most effective
                            means for direct communication with the Soviet people would be
                            nationwide radio and television appearances. Your 1959 Moscow speech had
                            a great and lasting impact on Soviet popular attitudes toward the U.S.,
                            even though it was not carried nationwide. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD_1">Eisenhower</persName> was to have made a
                            nationwide <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> speech during his visit to
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in 1960, just as <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS_1">Khrushchev</persName> had done in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. The Soviet Government could not refuse
                            your request for air time, and you could quite properly set forth your
                            concept of a generation of peace in the context of improving <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations. The novelty of hearing
                            the American viewpoint directly and fully would help reinforce the
                            development of Soviet attitudes in this direction.”</note> We are not so
                        sanguine that “the Soviet Government could not refuse your request,” but
                        agree that there is a very good possibility that it might be granted. For
                        this occasion we would suggest that we request the Soviets to invite the
                        President to speak to the student body of Moscow University. Such an event
                        would provide a dramatic platform and be guaranteed to attract worldwide
                        media coverage. He, of course, was permitted to speak directly to the Soviet

                    <p>In honor of the 25th anniversary of the <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1"
                            >Fulbright</persName> Scholarship program, the leaders of the Board of
                        Foreign Scholarships—a Presidentially-appointed group—have recently proposed
                        that the President recognize the co-authors of the original legislation,
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName> and Representative
                            <persName corresp="#p_HOE_1">Hays</persName>.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d153fn2">On September 23, the Board of Foreign Scholarships
                                (<gloss target="#t_BFS_1">BFS</gloss>), in recognition of the 25th
                            anniversary of the <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>
                            Program, hosted a luncheon meeting, at which <persName
                                corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName> was honored. That day, the
                                <gloss target="#t_BFS_1">BFS</gloss> released a statement entitled
                            “Educational Exchanges in the Seventies,” which contained new guidelines
                            for educational exchanges, developed by the <gloss target="#t_BFS_1"
                                >BFS</gloss>, Department of State, the American academic community,
                            and the binational <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>
                            Commissions. For the text of the Department announcement regarding the

                        in the Oval Office, a recommendation prompted in part by the Senator’s own
                        interest.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RJ_1">John Richardson</persName>, Jr., assistant
                        Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs, is supporting the
                        idea and in-house, <persName corresp="#p_MFV_1">Fred Malek</persName>, who
                        was first running a check on it, has now swung from opposition to support.
                        Before proceeding with a schedule request, however, it has been requested
                        that I solicit your opinions.</p>
                    <p>Here are the pros and cons as seen by the proponents:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advantages</p>
                    <p>1. Gesture of good will by the President, showing gracious and generous
                        character to those who are known to oppose him.</p>
                    <p>2. Identification of President with the major U.S. program for cultural and
                        educational exchange. The <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>
                        budget was badly slashed under <gloss target="#t_LBJ_1">LBJ</gloss> but has
                        been increased each year under this Administration. This support is an
                        important inroad to the university community, and would be well-highlighted
                        by a ceremony.</p>
                    <p>3. Identification of President with members of the academic community who are
                        Republicans, such as board chairman, <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1">Jim
                            Billington</persName>, <pb facs="0454" n="402" xml:id="pg_402"/> a young
                        professor of history at Princeton, and vice-chairman, <persName
                            corresp="#p_NL_1">Lyle Nelson</persName>, head of the Stanford
                        Communication Department. Other prominent scholars who are associated with
                        the board could also be brought in if appropriate.</p>
                    <p>4. Possible points with <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_HOE_1">Hays</persName>. The whole idea originated
                        when the Senator told the board that he was prouder of this program than any
                        other in which he had participated, and that he only regretted never being a
                        recipient.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Disadvantages</p>
                    <p>1. The differences between the President and <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1"
                            >Fulbright</persName> are sufficiently deep and long-standing that the
                        President might not wish to honor him in any way.</p>
                    <p>2. The timing is awkward: this is the 25th anniversary year so that a brief
                        ceremony would be better now, but the White House schedule is very tight and
                            <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName> will soon be going
                        home. It might be better in that sense to wait until January when the
                        President could more easily do it in the spirit of “fresh starts” with the
                        Congress.</p>

                    <p>The fighting which was mercifully short, ended in the birth of a new nation,
                        Bangla Desh. By any measure the immediate prospects of the new nation of 75
                        million people are anything but bright. It is doubtful that the new nation
                        can survive without substantial humanitarian and economic assistance for
                        some time to come. With the fate of Sheikh Mujib unknown, the political
                        viability and stability of Bangla Desh is equally questionable. The new
                        Bengal Nation necessarily will be heavily dependent upon India involving
                        some form of protectorate status, and that relationship, given the essential
                        differences between the two, contains the seeds of further dissension and
                        strife. An independent Bangla Desh, therefore, probably represents a
                        short-term solution rather than a permanent arrangement.<note n="4"

                        were two and India emerges as the dominant power in South Asia.</p>
                    <p>Traditionally, South Asia has been an area of major power rivalry and

                    <p>The conflict underlined the international ramifications of local wars and the

                    <p>We now have the Presidential decisions in regard to the study of
                        International Exchange which I prepared and you forwarded to the President
                        on August 13, 1971.<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">See <ref target="#d145"
                                >Document 145</ref>.</note> These decisions require the following
                        actions:</p>
                    <p>(1) Establishment by the Department of the criteria, methods, and procedures
                        for a central information system on exchanges covering all agencies of the
                        Federal Government,</p>
                    <p>(2) Development of further recommendations to the President regarding the
                        private international exchange council,</p>
                    <p>(3) Determination of the methods and procedures by which the Under
                        Secretaries Committee can carry out the responsibilities required by the
                        memorandum for program review and development, coordination, and long-range
                        planning regarding the totality of United States exchange programs with
                        other countries.</p>
                    <p>Since exchange committee deliberations touched on a number of these specific
                        points of implementation, I suggest that I seek the view of my task force
                        members in other agencies as appropriate and then present recommendations to
                        you regarding those aspects of the President’s decision that need further

                        reasoning was that the film might affect adversely the President’s visit to
                        the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>At Tab A<note n="4" xml:id="d158fn4">Not attached.</note> is a memorandum to
                        you from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName> saying
                        that—“just to keep you informed”—the documentary on Tibet has been submitted
                        to the Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts and Sciences for consideration as an
                        Academy Award nominee. In checking up on the background of Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName>’s move, we discovered that he
                        acted unilaterally and without reference to anyone else in <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> except the producer of the documentary.
                        As we understand it, the procedure now will be as follows: there will be a
                        screening in the first part of February by Academy representatives to
                        determine the documentary’s acceptability for a nomination. If nominated,
                        there will be a further screening by a jury in the first part of March to
                        judge the merits of the film against the other contenders; and finally, if
                        it makes the grade thus far, a final showing along with the other
                        contestants sometime in May.</p>
                    <p>Theoretically, there should be little or no publicity concerning the
                        documentary on Tibet in relation to the President’s visit, in view of the
                        fact that the initial screening in February will not be public. However,
                        there is a good chance that the news of the screening would <pb facs="0463"
                            n="411" xml:id="pg_411"/> nevertheless leak out, since the deferral of
                        the film’s release by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has already
                        been mentioned in a <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> article on <gloss

                            p. 21. Welles noted: “Both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LH_1"

                            decision to ban the picture. They conceded, however, that six months had
                            passed since the documentary’s completion and that there was little, if
                            any, likelihood that it would be released for distribution through
                            theaters and television stations abroad in the foreseeable future.”

                        connection with the President’s visit, but it would be embarrassing for the
                        differences of opinion over the screening of this film to become a matter of
                        widespread public knowledge.</p>
                    <p>On balance, U.S. interests would probably best be served if the film can be

                    <p>K: I hope I didn’t wake you up.</p>
                    <p>S: No, I’m fine.</p>
                    <p>K: I think I did. Frank, <persName corresp="#p_HHR_1">Bob Haldeman</persName>
                        told me yesterday you were thinking of leaving. I wanted to have an
                        opportunity to talk with you before you did this.</p>
                    <p>S: I’m leaving this weekend for Romania and the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>K: Could you leave open your final decision until we have a chance to talk? I
                        have certainly been one of the causes of your unhappiness
                        unintentionally—partly because I have so many sons of bitches to take care
                        of. People you can trust seem to slide to the bottom of the list. Your
                        leaving at this stage when you have been one of the few loyalists here and
                        one of the few who did what the President promised in 1968 would be
                        symbolically and substantively a disaster. I can understand your
                        dissatisfaction about being excluded from some of the meetings. This call is
                        my idea—nobody asked me to do this.</p>
                    <p>S: It’s a complicated situation. I very much appreciate your talking to me.
                        Why don’t we hold it until I return.</p>
                    <p>K: That is all I am asking. I want you to know—though I haven’t shown it in
                        my actions—the presence of one decent, loyal person has meant a lot. Above
                        all, we need you for the country. Whatever I can do to make you more
                        effective will be done.</p>
                    <p>S: As I said, it is a complicated situation. But I appreciate your call.</p>
                    <p>K: Don’t do anything until you come back and you and I talk.</p>
                    <p>S: All right.</p>
                    <p>K: But that doesn’t commit you not to go through with your plans. I
                        understand that you will not make a final decision until you talk to me but
                        that you are not going to reverse it. Is that a fair statement?</p>
                    <p>S: Yes. Henry, at the tag-end of this trip, we will be having the annual
                        German/American talks. Is there anything that occurred in the <persName

                    <p>K: The reports I got—I never read the minutes—don’t indicate anything. The
                        radios did not come up to the best of my knowledge.</p>

                        agenda was drawn up by the Germans, and they have included the Conference on

                    <p>K: You might get across to the Soviets that their press campaign against the
                        U.S. doesn’t make it any easier to proceed here along the lines of
                        detente.</p>
                    <p>S: Press campaign in what sense?</p>
                    <p>K: Their consistent attack on Sino/U.S. cooperation and their behavior on
                        Vietnam.</p>

                            about China to other audiences. As such, he asserted: “It is imperative,
                            therefore, both in terms of credibility for the official information arm
                            of the U.S. Government abroad, and in furtherance of U.S. policy abroad,

                        <p>This memo is brief since the point to be made is simple, though critical.
                            We can discuss it further if you wish . . . and I hope you do.</p>
                        <p>You inform me that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR_1"
                                >Laird</persName> has expressed concern about “serious gaps in the
                            knowledge and understanding of our friends with regard to our foreign
                                <pb facs="0468" n="416" xml:id="pg_416"/> policy and national
                            security objectives.” Based on extensive travel and contact, I share the
                            Secretary’s concern.</p>
                        <p>You request an “action plan . . . based primarily on <gloss
                                target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> resources” to address the situation.
                            I respectfully suggest that to submit an operations plan would really
                            mislead both you and the President as to the central and very serious
                            weakness of our foreign information program. It is not lack of plan; it
                            is lack of knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Full understanding of real objectives . . . both day-to-day and long-term
                            . . . is essential to the creation of effective communications support
                            programs. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> management is not
                            provided with that understanding, thus the communications support
                            provided to United States foreign policy and national security
                            objectives is much weaker and less imaginative than it should be. No
                            operational action plan will correct that weakness.</p>
                        <p>The problem of poor management information is so overriding and so
                            inhibits our ability to provide the kind of support which the nation
                            deeply needs that it would be unfair to the President to respond in any
                            other way.</p>

                    <p>I am pleased to report that plans are now well advanced for the Springtime
                        visit for the Chinese Table Tennis Team.</p>
                    <p>In answer to Premier Chou En Lai’s announcement, <persName corresp="#p_SG_2"
                            >Graham Steenhoven</persName>, president of the American Table Tennis
                        Association, is about to cable Peking suggesting that:</p>
                    <p>1. The Chinese Table Tennis Team, accompanied by appropriate Chinese
                        officials, visit the United States sometime between April 15 and May 15 for
                        a two-week visit. Chinese journalists would be invited to accompany the
                        group.</p>
                    <p>2. A proposed itinerary includes visits to these seven cities: Los Angeles,
                        Detroit, Washington, New York, Atlanta, San Francisco and Honolulu. Table
                        Tennis matches would be scheduled in Los Angeles, Detroit and Atlanta.</p>
                    <pb facs="0469" n="417" xml:id="pg_417"/>
                    <p>3. The Washington stop leaves open the possibility of a meeting with the
                        President (although nothing is said to the Chinese about this), but makes no
                        arrangements for visits with Congressional leaders, political figures and/or
                        government leaders.</p>
                    <p>4. The visit is being consponsored by the National Committee on United
                        States-China Relations, Inc., which is arranging receptions, dinners,
                        transportation and other details. President Carl F. Stover, who is in
                        frequent contact with me, is personally handling this, and is keeping close
                        tabs on <persName corresp="#p_SG_2">Steenhoven</persName> to make sure that
                        all plans are carefully coordinated.</p>
                    <p>5. The National Committee on United States-China Relations, Inc. has already
                        raised $60,000 to meet the cost of the tour. It anticipates that another
                        $140,000 will be forthcoming from additional pledges. Pan <gloss
                            target="#t_Am_1">Am</gloss> has offered a jet charter for all travel.
                        The list of patrons includes some of the most prominent corporations in the
                        United States. Plans are afoot to add contributions from labor and religious
                        organizations.</p>
                    <p>6. I am personally overseeing all arrangements, hoping to anticipate any
                        problems, including those of security. In keeping with your instructions,
                        the visit will be dignified, yet friendly, with time for some sightseeing
                        and some contact with average Americans. I have suggested that a side trip
                        to Williamsburg be added to the Washington stay, and that the San Francisco
                        visit include a possible visit to the Stanford University campus.</p>
                    <p>Further, I have suggested that <persName corresp="#p_SG_2"
                            >Steenhoven</persName> indicate in his cable that it would be desirable
                        that the Chinese team visit the United States in advance of a proposed
                        similar tour of Canada, which tentatively has been set for sometime in
                        April. I will continue to keep you abreast of all developments.</p>

                    <p>President’s unprecedented journey marks both beginning and an end. Hopefully,
                        it will be beginning of process of communication between world’s most
                        powerful nation and world’s most populous nation. It is end of over two
                        decades <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> relations with <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> which were characterized by mutual
                        hostility.</p>
                    <p>While journey will not rpt not result in instant solutions to <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> differences with China, opening of dialogue
                        at highest level will serve cause of world peace. For this reason,
                        President’s initiative has received enthusiastic support from American
                        people and worldwide approval.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">TREATMENT</p>
                    <p>Output should be full and factual, conveying serious purpose, historic
                        significance and stated objectives of trip. In coverage of color and
                        ceremony attendant upon this event, our commentaries should not focus on
                        commercial media’s interest in unusual or the bizarre.</p>
                    <p>Since President himself has indicated probability that the only information
                        on agenda and talks will be contained in joint communiqué upon conclusion of
                        discussions, speculation would neither be productive nor in <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interest. Thus every effort should be made
                        to stay with and give full play to official pronouncements, statements and
                        communiqués, as well as reports filed by <gloss target="#t_VOA_1"
                            >VOA</gloss>’s correspondent on the scene. Our media output and field
                        posts should take full advantage of responsible and balanced domestic and
                        foreign reaction.</p>

                        provides the conceptual framework within which meetings will take place.</p>
                    <p>Following are points of emphasis to be used as appropriate:</p>
                    <p>—We should portray this event as part of President’s worldwide efforts for
                        generation of peace. These include (1) beginning of new relationship with
                        Soviet Union; (2) laying of foundation for improved relationship with
                        European allies and Japan; and (3) creation of a new environment for world’s
                        trade and monetary activities.</p>
                    <p>—Major purpose of President’s decision to visit <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                            >PRC</gloss> is to establish dialogue and develop process for continuing
                        discussions of any differences.</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> well aware of problems as well as
                        opportunities, but accepts challenge of reducing differences and building
                        more constructive relationship.</p>
                    <p>—Exchange of views is essential to world peace, particularly in an age of
                        turmoil and nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                        will meet as equals in efforts to reduce tensions and differences. Neither
                        country expects the other to barter away either country’s principles or
                        abandon its friends.</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> will maintain its commitments and will
                        not negotiate on behalf of third parties.</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> will preserve its close relationship with
                        Japan, as it seeks to gain better understanding with China.</p>
                    <p>—Rather than attempting to exploit Sino-Soviet differences, <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> desires to better relations with both
                        countries. <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> efforts to improve relations
                        with <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> are intended to enhance prospects
                        of world peace. Attempts to interpret <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                        initiatives in any other light lack basis in reason or fact.</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> will maintain its friendship, diplomatic
                        ties and its defense commitment with Republic of China on Taiwan. Ultimate
                        relationship between Taiwan and mainland is not matter for <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> to decide.</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> does not expect instant solutions.
                        President has emphasized existence of major differences. Thus output should
                        not raise undue expectations.</p>
                    <p>—China’s cooperation in vast and complex arrangements that accompany the
                        travel of America’s Chief Executive demonstrates a climate of mutual trust
                        and respect. Hospitality of host government, events themselves and the
                        concomitant media coverage are testimony to atmosphere within which detailed
                        arrangements have been made by both governments for President and First
                        Lady.</p>
                    <pb facs="0472" n="420" xml:id="pg_420"/>
                    <p>—Meetings with Chou-En-lai and Mao Tse-tung will be primarily dialogue which
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> hopes will lead to period of
                        negotiation rather than confrontation.</p>
                    <p>—Peace in Asia and in the world requires the participation of China whose
                        population represents one quarter of the human race. President goes to
                        Peking without illusions. He goes “committed to improvement of relations
                        between our two peoples, for the sake of our two peoples and the people of
                        the world.”<note n="4" xml:id="d162fn4">The quotation is from the

                    <p>I am enclosing a copy of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ACD_1">Ablard</persName>’s
                        letter of February 28 to Mr. Robert Dockery of the Committee staff
                        concerning the status of the Country Program Memoranda prepared by the

                                >Ablard</persName> explained that an “evaluation” of the CPMs and
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Planning Papers “reveals that

                            documents which are in many cases unapproved and in raw form.” He stated
                            that, as a result, “it would not be appropriate to provide these
                            documents” to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Agency would
                            be able to provide “a summary of the approved country objectives,
                            activities to implement them, and principal <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                                >USIA</gloss> audiences” as well as “an oral briefing on a

                            facs="0473" n="421" xml:id="pg_421"/> as such, the Agency believes that
                        “it would not be appropriate to provide these documents to the

                    <p>Obviously, the practice of jamming in part negates the meaningful two-way
                        flow of information which the President hopes to achieve. The United States
                        does not jam the English or Chinese language broadcasts emanating from
                        China. Moreover, the views of Chinese leaders are given a full hearing in
                        the American press, particularly now that their representatives are
                        permanently established in New York City.</p>
                    <p>In equity and fairness, therefore, we believe a case to eliminate jamming
                        should be made to the People’s Republic of China at an appropriate time. At
                        present the overseas broadcasts of Japan, Australia and Great Britain, among
                        others, go unjammed by Peking.</p>

                        reports that he is already receiving numerous inquiries, such as the
                            attached,<note n="2" xml:id="d165fn2">Not attached.</note> asking for
                        assistance and/or guidance for journalists’ visits to China under whatever
                        cultural exchange can be worked out with the Chinese government.</p>
                    <p>He discussed this matter with me today for the purpose of working out a
                        united government position on what, if anything, the government should do to
                        help American newsmen.</p>
                    <p>I bring this up to you for your consideration in fitting it within the broad
                        framework of cultural exchanges with the Chinese. I offer these points as
                        possible guideposts:</p>
                    <p>1. The U.S. government must avoid encouraging, or appearing to encourage, the
                        Chinese to select or favor any single American news organization or newsman.
                        We should maintain a hands-off impartiality, leaving it to the Chinese to
                        decide whom to admit, either for visits or for permanent accreditation, if
                        and when the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> chooses to do so.</p>
                    <p>2. As a government, however, we might encourage the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                            >PRC</gloss> to allow American newsmen to visit China on reporting
                        assignments and to allow American news organizations to establish permanent
                        news bureaus in China. In return, we should welcome visits by Chinese
                        newsmen and the establishment of permanent news bureaus in the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>3. As a government we should agree on a contact point for news organizations
                        and newsmen interested in such reporting, in view of what has been said
                        publicly about such journalistic exchanges, both by the President and in the
                        Chinese-U.S. communique<note n="3" xml:id="d165fn3">Printed in <ref

                                203</ref>.</note> after the President’s visit. The State Department
                        might be considered as the appropriate contact point, if it is to handle
                        exchanges generally. State could <pb facs="0476" n="424" xml:id="pg_424"/>
                        receive and relay applications to the Chinese and assist in whatever way the
                        government would decide on as appropriate under the policy.</p>
                    <p>Setting a policy and a procedure to be followed will become increasingly
                        urgent as the applications begin to snowball. It would seem to me that some
                        U.S. government involvement is inescapable in arranging such journalistic
                        exchanges, unlike other visits such as those by physicians, educators,
                        technicians, etc., which could be handled via a sponsoring organization such
                        as the National Committee for the U.S.-China Relations.</p>
                    <p>As you recall, while in Hangchou, the Acting Director of Information for the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, P’eng Hua, at one point advised
                        Ziegler and me that the Chinese had decided to allow 15 American newsmen to
                        remain for a 7–10 day period after the President left China. Ziegler and I
                        both advised him this was a decision for the Chinese to make but that, as a
                        principle, we favored journalistic exchanges. As you know, the Chinese later
                        changed their minds and allowed only two American newsmen to remain
                            behind.<note n="4" xml:id="d165fn4">In a March 28 memorandum to

                        the Communist word. We therefore request consideration of capital funds in
                        the order of $75 million to be spent over the next few years to construct
                        the necessary new transmitting facilities.</p>
                    <p>The Voice of America provides the only direct, uncensorable, overt channel of
                        the U.S. Government to the peoples and leaders of those countries where the
                        free flow of information is restricted or prohibited. At times of crisis the
                        Voice provides a uniquely useful service.</p>
                    <p>To achieve maximum effectiveness the Voice must not only be audible but the
                        audience must hear the signal as easily and reliably as the signals of our
                        competitors. The Voice is falling seriously behind the rest of the world in
                        its ability to deliver a competitive signal, especially to the most
                        important targets of East Europe, Russia and China. The Voice has too few
                        transmitters with which to combat the jamming. The rest of the world is
                        building at a very rapid rate. For example, Russia is well along in
                        construction of four massive new transmitting facilities. Their new antennas
                        are significantly more powerful than our best.</p>
                    <p>Prior to World War II, 50-kilowatt transmitters were among the most powerful
                        for shortwave broadcasting. When the Voice started a <pb facs="0478" n="426"
                            xml:id="pg_426"/> building program in the late fifties in order to catch
                        up with the competition which had continued to build while the Voice sat
                        still during the early fifties, it pioneered the development of 250-kilowatt
                        transmitters. In 1962 there were nineteen such transmitters in the world,
                        fourteen at the Voice of America, four Voice of America transmitters which
                        had been purchased by Radio Liberty, and one Communist Chinese. By 1968
                        there were 52 transmitters, 32 of which were U.S. There are now 185 high
                        powered transmitters—all operated by their respective governments. The Voice
                        has 45, Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe each have four, making a U.S.
                        total of 53. The Communists have 71. Our information indicates that
                        approximately 100 new high power transmitters are under construction or
                        actively planned, many of them of 500-kilowatts or better, of which only
                        nine 250-kilowatts are ours. The last <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                        appropriation for new shortwave transmitters was in fiscal 1964 when the
                        construction of the facility at Kavala, Greece was begun.</p>
                    <p>High power is necessary due to the chaos existing in the shortwave frequency
                        bands. Shortwave broadcasting by all the countries of the world has
                        increased 25% in the last decade. There are now about 1300 transmitters
                        located throughout the world which result in an average of two transmitters
                        on each frequency simultaneously. At peak hours and to highly important
                        targets there may be as many as three or four transmitters on the same
                        frequency. Only the strongest signal will get through. The others will be
                        drowned out. I therefore consider it essential that the Voice of America
                        power be significantly increased.</p>
                    <p>Our three oldest, most obsolete plants are in Okinawa, Tangier and Munich—the
                        latter using transmitters captured from the Germans in World War II.</p>
                    <p>Okinawa is the most urgent since the Reversion Treaty<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d166fn2">Presumable reference to the Okinawa Reversion Treaty.
                            During World War II, United States forces captured the Ryukyu and Daito
                            Islands; under the 1951 Peace Treaty, the United States assumed
                            responsibility for the islands. In November 1969, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName> and Japanese Prime Minister Sato
                            announced an agreement that reversion negotiations would take place. On
                            June 17, 1971, U.S. and Japanese officials signed the “Agreement Between
                            the United States of America and Japan Concerning the Ryukyu Islands and
                            the Daito Islands” both in Washington and in Tokyo. On November 10, the
                            Senate, by an 84–6 roll call vote, ratified the Reversion Treaty (<gloss

                            Daito Islands to Japan. The reversion subsequently took place on May 15,
                            1972. (<hi rend="italic">Congress and the Nation</hi>, vol. III,
                            1969–1972, pp. 878–879)</note> requires us to relocate by May 1977. The
                        tone of debate in the Diet indicates that there is little chance of
                        obtaining a reversal or even a delay. The Japanese have agreed to pay us $16
                        million, the cost of duplicating the old station. However, we need modern
                        high power transmitters if we are to put a competitive signal into Northern
                        China and Asiatic Russia. We have, therefore, proposed to the <gloss
                            target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> that we seek an agreement <pb facs="0479"
                            n="427" xml:id="pg_427"/> with South Korea and construct a modern plant.
                        This would require an additional $20 million.</p>
                    <p>Due to the potential instability in Morocco, I believe that rather than
                        modernize the plant in Tangier we should build a new one in either Portugal
                        or Spain. The cost, $25 million, would be about the same as modernizing
                        Tangier. The modernization of our plant in Germany would be approximately
                        $20 million.</p>
                    <p>While these three transmitter facilities are of the highest priority, there
                        are three or four others, including some in the United States, requiring
                        improvement which we should have in order to make our signal competitive
                        throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>The state of the art, particularly in high power transmitting tubes, has so
                        advanced that it appears feasible to construct a superpower transmitter—10
                        times more powerful than current transmitters. We believe that the Russians
                        are now experimenting in this field and that we at an early point should
                        consider building and operating such a new generation transmitter. The cost
                        would be about $10 million.</p>
                    <p>However, we should first concentrate on the highest priority—replacement of
                        the obsolete.</p>
                    <p>Even with the most friendly countries, experience has shown that negotiating
                        a relay station agreement is a long, arduous and sometimes expensive
                        undertaking. It should not be commenced without assurance that if an
                        agreement is obtained the necessary funds will be provided. Experience also
                        indicates that it takes about five years from beginning negotiations until
                        the transmitters are functioning.</p>
                    <p>These capital funds—in the order of $75 million—loom so large compared to our
                        regular operating budget of $200 million that it is very difficult to get
                        approval through the normal budgetary channels.</p>
                    <p>I therefore request that we be authorized to seek the necessary agreements
                        with foreign governments so that when and if such agreements are obtained we
                        will be able to request funds through the normal procedures.</p>
                    <p>I believe this project to be urgent and of unique importance to our national
                        interest.</p>

                            are not approved Executive Branch positions.”<note n="5"

                            memorandum, I fully explained why I considered that the disclosure of
                            such internal working papers to the Congress would not be in the public
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>I have now been informed that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and
                            the House Foreign Operations and Government Information Subcommittee
                            have requested basic planning documents submitted by the country field
                            teams to the United States Information Agency and the Agency for
                            International Development, and other similar papers. These documents
                            include all <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Country Program
                            Memoranda and the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> fiscal year 1973
                            Country Field Submission for Cambodia, which are prepared in the field
                            for the benefit of the agencies and the Department of State and contain
                            recommendations for the future.</p>
                        <p>Due to these new requests for documents of a similar nature to those
                            covered by my August 30, 1971 directive, I hereby reiterate the position
                            of this Administration so that there can be no misunderstanding on this
                            point.</p>
                        <p>My memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, dated
                            March 24, 1969,<note n="6" xml:id="d167fn6">Attached but not
                                printed.</note> set forth our basic policy which is to comply to the
                            fullest extent possible with Congressional requests for information. In
                            pursuance of this policy, the Executive Departments and Agencies have
                            provided to the Congress an unprecedented volume of information. In
                            addition, Administration witnesses have appeared almost continuously
                            before appropriate Committees of the Congress to present pertinent facts
                            and information to satisfy Congressional needs in its oversight function
                            and to present the views of the Administration on proposed
                            legislation.</p>
                        <pb facs="0482" n="430" xml:id="pg_430"/>
                        <p>The precedents on separation of powers established by my predecessors
                            from first to last clearly demonstrate, however, that the President has
                            the responsibility not to make available any information and material
                            which would impair the orderly function of the Executive Branch of
                            Government, since to do so would not be in the public interest. As
                            indicated in my memorandum of March 24, 1969, this Administration will
                            invoke Executive Privilege to withhold information only in the most
                            compelling circumstances and only after a rigorous inquiry into the
                            actual need for its exercise.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the procedures established in my memorandum of March
                            24, 1969, I have conducted an inquiry with regard to the Congressional
                            requests brought to my attention in this instance. The basic planning
                            data and the various internal staff papers requested by the Senate
                            Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Operations and
                            Government Information Subcommittee do not, insofar as they deal with
                            future years, reflect any approved program of this Administration, but
                            only proposals that are under consideration. Furthermore, the basic
                            planning data requested reflect only tentative intermediate staff level
                            thinking, which is but one step in the process of preparing
                            recommendations to the Department Heads, and thereafter to me.<note

                        <p>I repeat my deep concern, shared by my predecessors, that unless privacy
                            of preliminary exchange of views between personnel of the Executive
                            Branch can be maintained, the full frank and healthy expression of
                            opinion which is essential for the successful administration of
                            Government would be muted.</p>
                        <p>Due to these facts and considerations, it is my determination that these
                            documents fall within the conceptual scope of my directive of August 30,
                            1971 and that their disclosure to the Congress would also, as in that
                            instance, not be in the public interest.</p>
                        <p>I, therefore, direct you not to make available to the Congress any
                            internal working documents concerning the foreign assistance program or
                            international information activities, which would disclose tentative
                            planning data, such as is found in the Country Program Memoranda and the
                            Country Field Submissions, and which are not approved positions.<note

                            Departments and Agencies to continue to make available to the Congress
                            all information relating to the foreign assistance program and

                        people living within the borders of the Soviet Union. These people are not
                        “Soviets,” Frank points out, but Russians, Ukrainians, Latvians, Uzbecks,
                        etc. To call the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> a “nation,” when it
                        is a <hi rend="italic">multi-national</hi> state, fosters an illusion that

                        him to request a copy of the memorandum and asking if the press stories had
                        quoted it correctly. State didn’t have the memorandum at the time and
                        doesn’t intend to give the Embassy a copy, but the Soviets (Russians, we
                        mean) will be able to get it when it comes out in the published
                        hearings.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> tells us that Frank dashed this
                        memorandum off after a meeting with Dick Pipes, whose views you will
                        recognize in it. He apparently did not consult with anybody on his staff or
                        in State before sending it. Somebody then leaked it to <persName
                            corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>, who had it ready for the
                        hearings.</p>
                    <p>We understand that Frank’s memorandum does not foreshadow any change in Voice
                        transmission policies or other <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                        output. The Voice has been broadcasting in several Soviet Union minority
                        languages for a long time and tries to refer to the “peoples of the Soviet
                        Union,” rather than the “Soviet people.”</p>
                    <p>A possibility, although State discounts it, is that the Soviet Embassy will
                        enter a formal protest once it has the full text. The last sentence of the
                        memorandum will bug the Soviet Union’s authorities, but they are on weak
                        ground to protest for they themselves acknowledge that the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is a multi-national state.</p>
                    <p>Frank is covering his flanks by sending you his memorandum after it was
                        leaked to <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>. There is no
                        need to reply unless you wish to warn him to go easy on needling the Soviet

                        <p><gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> propaganda increasingly refers to
                            the people who live within its borders as “the Soviets.” There is no
                            such thing. The correct meaning of soviet is a council of workers. Use
                            of the word as a collective noun for the population of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> should be avoided by our media and
                            officers.</p>
                        <p>The people of the major nations within the Soviet Union should be
                            referred to by their nationality i.e. Ukrainians, Georgians, Latvians,
                            Russians, Uzbeks, Armenians, etc.</p>
                        <p>To put it another way, the people of Georgia are Georgians; they are not
                            Soviets, Russians, or anything else.</p>
                        <p>Correct use of words and terms is important, particularly when we are
                            dealing with opponents who commonly distort meanings for purposes of
                            deliberate confusion, deception, or political and psychological
                            ends.</p>
                        <pb facs="0486" n="434" xml:id="pg_434"/>
                        <p>Example: In the February issue of SOVIET LIFE, reference is made to “a
                            new historical community of peoples—the Soviet nation.” This is
                            semantical absurdity. There is no “Soviet nation” and never will be. The
                            Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a state; it encompasses <hi
                                rend="italic">many</hi> nations, and is thus a multi-national state
                            . . . but it is not a nation. To call it so, apart from being
                            grammatically incorrect, is to foster the illusion of one happy family
                            rather than an imperialist state increasingly beset with nationality
                            problems, which is what it is.</p>

                    <p>Last year <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> produced a film on the
                        Chinese Communist subjugation of Tibet entitled “Man from a Missing Land,”
                        which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName> planned to
                        release last September. The film was to be distributed worldwide through
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> offices in each country. Although
                        there had been virtually no reference to Tibet in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> output for some years, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1"
                            >Shakespeare</persName> held that, because Peking continued to attack
                        the Administration (actually Peking had modified its polemics significantly
                        after the advent of ping pong diplomacy), “it makes little sense for the
                        U.S. to refrain from attempting to focus the attention of the world’s
                        peoples on the nature and historical acts of the men in power in Peking. If
                        the Peking Government continues to believe that it is to their advan<pb

                    <p>In early January, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1">Shakespeare</persName>
                        informed us he had submitted the film to the Academy of Motion Pictures,
                        Arts, and Sciences for the Academy Award competition (Tab C).<note n="3"

                        of the competition were to have been held in February and March, with the

                        from the competitions until after the Moscow summit.</p>
                    <p>I believe we should now inform Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ_1"
                            >Shakespeare</persName> that the film should be permanently withheld
                        from distribution or screening through <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> or any other channel. As you know, the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> toned down its attacks on your
                        Administration (they had very largely refrained from direct attacks on you
                        personally since last spring) during your visit to China, and they have
                        turned the volume and content up again only somewhat since your visit.
                        Peking’s current propaganda attacks against the U.S. Government thus are
                        considerably below what they were only a year ago. Distribution of this
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> attack on <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> rule in Tibet would therefore clearly not
                        be to our advantage. There is the risk of press play for this in-house
                        difference of opinion (the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> is aware of
                        the film’s existence),<note n="4" xml:id="d169fn4">See <ref

                        this problem is much smaller and more manageable than those that would
                        certainly result in our relations with Peking if it were released.</p>

                        exists, popular morale is poor, and that criticism of the regime is

                        working with their counterparts in the military service and the Defense

                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> has a covert program underway to
                        convince the top Hanoi leadership that the U.S. Government is in clandestine
                        communication with a high-level dissident faction within the North
                        Vietnamese Party apparatus.</p>
                    <p>—The first phase of this program involves “leaking” through a trusted agent
                        in Vientiane the alleged word of an American official that “there are some
                        people in Hanoi who <hi rend="italic">also</hi> want to end this stupid war”
                        and “thank God not everybody on the Central Committee is crazy.”</p>
                    <p>—“Evidence” will then be provided from a variety of sources and agents to
                        develop the legend that the U.S. Government is in secret contact with a
                        dissident faction in the North Vietnamese heirarchy. It might even be said
                        that it was this faction which recommended the mining of Haiphong as the
                        only tangible way to break the power of the hard-liners in Hanoi.</p>
                    <p>—The effects of this disinformation program could be significant—tensions and
                        suspicions within the already-paranoic Hanoi leadership might increase, and

                        <p>Following the Moscow Summit we have reviewed <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                                >USIA</gloss> output worldwide to see which new emphases we should
                            introduce. Our review has included an analysis of the content of the
                            Soviet Union’s media addressed to international audiences. Their output
                            has been cautious, with low-key attention to events in Viet-Nam and a
                            general toning down of critical comment about the United States. At the
                            same time, there has been an increase in the number of spontaneous items

                            >USIA</gloss>’s media to communicate our satisfaction with the important
                            agreements which have been reached and our desire to supplement these
                            with additional accords. We acknowledge that we disagree on ideology and
                            Viet-Nam; and we state clearly the American position on these subjects.
                            We also express the policy of the United States on the Middle East,

                    <p>Much of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s effort in the international
                        communications field is devoted to explaining and interpreting the United
                        States in terms of its historical development, its current policies, its
                        future hopes, its people and its institutions. Therefore, the Bicentennial
                        period adds additional reinforcement to activities in which we would be
                        engaged anyway; and to the extent domestic Bicentennial activities provide
                        new depth and understanding of our system and way of life at home, the more
                        impact <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> can have abroad. For this
                        reason it is virtually impossible to separate out cost data for
                        Bicentennial-related activities. However, we estimate that by <gloss
                            target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1976 a significant portion of our media
                        products and overseas cultural and information effort, as well as training
                        programs for our personnel, will be related to Bicentennial purposes.</p>
                    <p>Within <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s regular program expenditures
                        in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1976 approximately $15 million will be
                        used for Bicentennial programs. Lesser amounts will be spent in the years
                        leading up to <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1976, beginning with the
                        production or acquisition of media materials this year. Some of the most
                        costly items will be two major documentary film productions (discussed
                        below). It is planned that the principal funding for another major item, the

                    <p>We have felt the need for consultation with the academic community on themes
                        and presentation to foreign audiences of what the two hundred years of the

                        terms of contemporary and future implications. Consequently we have created
                        an Ad Hoc Committee which will meet for two days in September at Airlie

                            >USIA</gloss> officers</p>
                    <p>We have placed three of our officers as full-time students in several
                        universities for this academic year to develop their expertise in American
                        Studies. We are conducting a census of Agency officers who could be
                        programmed as lecturers in Bicentennial programs abroad; we are also
                        identifying the most prominent gaps in the American Studies expertise
                        possessed by officers now on Agency rolls. We have had a team from the
                        American Studies Association evaluate the Agency’s Contemporary America
                        seminar, which is one of the principal means we use to keep our officers up
                        to date on the U.S. scene.</p>
                    <p>Pending final recommendations from the Ad Hoc Committee mentioned above, we
                        expect to develop several Bicentennial seminars for junior officers. We
                        shall also institute longer-range Bicentennial seminars at mid-career and
                        reorientation levels through which senior Agency officers may reinforce
                        their knowledge.</p>

                    <p>A major exhibit is presently in the planning stage, in cooperation with the
                            <gloss target="#t_ARBC_1">ARBC</gloss>, which will portray the
                        continuing significance of the ideals and concepts of America’s founding
                        fathers.</p>
                    <p>Funded by the <gloss target="#t_ARBC_1">ARBC</gloss>, the exhibit will be
                        constructed under <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> direction. The
                        presentation will have international relevance in its treatment of the
                        exchange of ideas which were current on both sides of the Atlantic during
                        the Age of Enlightenment and the resultant contribution to American thought
                        in colonial times. It will show the contributions of Jefferson and other
                        colonial leaders to the emergence of American political and social idealism,
                        as well as to the development of similar political ideals in other
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>This multi-media presentation will begin U.S. cultural efforts overseas and
                        catalyze the activities of other countries. A joint “opening” in Paris and
                        in Tokyo is projected. The Director of the Grand Palais in Paris has invited
                        the United States to mount an exhibit in the main exhibition hall in 1974.
                        The “Age of Jefferson” would be shown at this prestigious site in the spring
                        of 1974. Discussions are underway with the Nippon Cultural Centre of Japan
                        to sponsor satellite <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> coverage of the
                        Paris opening as well as an exhibit in conjunction with the Paris opening.
                        It is hoped that parallel cultural events will take place elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>The “Age of Jefferson” should stimulate activities in other countries. The
                        Government of France hopes to present a “Sound and Light” commemorating the
                        American Revolution at one of our historic sites such as Mount Vernon or
                        Monticello. The Government of France and other governments and private
                        organizations overseas are exploring ideas for exhibits, seminars,
                        exchanges, research and publications efforts.</p>
                    <p>“Spinoff” and follow-up cultural programming for the “Age” is expected. In
                        addition to smaller multi-media presentations of the “Age” in other major
                        world capitals, related meetings sponsored by <gloss target="#t_USIS_1"
                            >USIS</gloss> posts and local organizations in other countries can be
                        expected.</p>
                    <pb facs="0501" n="449" xml:id="pg_449"/>
                    <p>“Sound and Light”, audio-visual and film techniques will help the visitor
                        experience the times, the thought and better understand the personalities
                        and contributions of Jefferson and his Age. Historic artifacts or copies,
                        and information material will be part of the exhibit.</p>
                    <p>World famous architect, designer, film maker and furniture designer Charles
                        Eames is designing the exhibit. Recipient of awards and recognition both in
                        the U.S. and abroad, Eames has created exhibits and films for several major
                        expositions.</p>
                    <p>After showings of the “Age of Jefferson” in Paris and other European
                        capitals, the exhibit may be suitable for use in the U.S. in 1975 under the

                        other nations, and (b) advising the President, his representatives abroad,
                        and the various departments and agencies on the implications of foreign
                        opinion for present and contemplated United States policies, programs and
                        official statements. The influencing of attitudes is to be carried out by
                        overt use of the various techniques of communication—personal contact, radio
                        broadcasting, libraries, book publication and distribution, press, motion
                        pictures, television, exhibits, English-language instruction, and others” .

                    <p>1. The Ad Hoc Committee, and especially the nine experienced academicians,
                        agreed that the Bicentennial commemoration presents <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>
                        with a great opportunity to strengthen international communication; it makes
                        certain recommendations as to emphasis and specific next steps; and it
                        urgently asks for action. The committee believes that if the job is done
                        well in the areas of our recommendations, a quality dialogue between the
                        U.S. and other nations may very well be enhanced for some years in the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>2. Since the Bicentennial celebration marks an anniversary of two hundred
                        years of working together, programming targeted upon Bicentennial projects
                        should emphasize, in particular, three vital elements in American life:</p>
                    <quote><p>a) the dynamic process that has historically relied on consensus and
                            cooperation, through which the United States has become one of the
                            oldest and most continuously stable constitutional nations in the world,
                            while at the same time pacing the world in social change;<note n="3"

                                underlined “dynamic” and “consensus and cooperation.” He also placed
                                a checkmark in the left-hand margin next to this point. </note></p>
                        <p>b) the United States as the Inquiring Society, engaged in persistent and
                            healthy self-criticism and efforts at reform, as an indication of the
                            confidence we have in our past and our hopes for evolving
                                institutions;<note n="4" xml:id="d175fn4"><persName

                        <p>c) the United States as still an open society, a land of opportunity in
                            its regional and cultural diversity, in its fluidity and mobility, and
                            it its mature ability to recognize rather than hide its problems.<note

                    <p>3. The Ad Hoc Committee resoundingly endorsed a series of specific projects
                        and urges <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                            >CU</gloss> to provide the necessary program support, in funding and in
                        staff, to bring these proposals from idea to reality:</p>

                            Institute of Advanced American Studies</hi> (<gloss target="#t_BIAAS_1"
                            >BIAAS</gloss>) be created, which would strengthen international
                        exchange focused on American Studies and the study of contemporary America.
                        The <gloss target="#t_BIAAS_1">BIAAS</gloss> should be a secretariat which
                        would receive funds, and provide facilitative assistance for foreign
                        scholars, artists and cultural leaders, publicists and Americanists. Some of
                        these research visitors might want to be accredited to universities, major
                        research libraries, the Library of Congress and local institutions or
                        libraries, or presidential centers. The funding for the <gloss
                            target="#t_BIAAS_1">BIAAS</gloss> should reflect external support (from
                        foreign governments and foundations for their nationals) in partnership with
                        funds from the U.S.</p>
                    <p>b) <hi rend="italic">Proposal II</hi>—that there should be an <hi
                            rend="italic">International Congress of Foreign Associations of American
                            Studies</hi> in the U.S. in 1976. The strengthening of international
                        exchange can usefully be focused on groups with strong personal and
                        professional commitments to America. In most major countries associations of
                        American Studies, and professional organizations with American links, exist
                        and would welcome the chance to come to the U.S. in the Bicentennial year.
                        The Department of State, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_ARBC_1">ARBC</gloss> and perhaps Colonial Williamsburg should
                        now plan space-available international conference facilities. The program
                        should be coordinated with the American Council of Learned Societies, the
                        Social Science Research Council, the Conference Board and foreign scholar
                        associations. As for funding, again foreign governments and foundations
                        should be invited to aid their national associations and <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> should appropriate <gloss target="#t_FY_1"

                    <p>c) <hi rend="italic">Proposal III</hi>—that exchange opportunities be vastly
                        expanded as a special <hi rend="italic">Bicentennial International Visitors
                            Program</hi>. We believe that exchange is the single most valuable
                        instrument of building empathy and understanding abroad for the United
                        States. The international visitors program concept is sound, universally
                        supported, and cost effective. We emphasize that this program should reach
                        out to all <pb facs="0504" n="452" xml:id="pg_452"/> elements of
                        society—e.g., publicists, parliamentarians, labor leaders, journalists,
                        youth. We recommend, therefore, that the <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>
                        program should be expanded; that there should be coordinated use of the
                        exchange of persons program of other governmental agencies for Bicentennial
                        purposes; and that the Festival <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> portion
                        of the Bicentennial, in which both public and private agencies will be
                        cooperating, should result in quality attention for our foreign visitors. We
                        wish to give reality to the President’s invitation to the world to come and
                        help us celebrate our two hundred years of achievement and our next hundred
                        years of inquiry and experimentation. We stress that this must be a program
                        of <hi rend="italic">quality</hi>.</p>

                        program to prepare them in fresh, new ways for the Bicentennial years, for
                        we believe that few officers are now able either to take advantage of the
                        unique opportunities offered by the Bicentennial concept or to implement the
                        newer approaches to American Studies which must be the basis for future
                        programming. To this end we overwhelmingly recommend that the Agency provide
                        the necessary staff—beginning immediately with at least one officer assigned
                        for this specific purpose—and funds to make possible the introduction of two
                        proposals in this fiscal year:</p>

                        during the Bicentennial years. The themes are as follows:</p>

                    <p>5. Suggesting the importance attached to this aspect of the meeting at Airlie
                        House, the conference organized itself into six sub-groups, each devoting
                        the better parts of an evening and a morning to developing the tentative
                        themes. Refinement and organization of these statements for further
                        presentation must await the official transcript and notes, and media
                        implementation recommendations could well be an item on the Agenda of the
                        February meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, however, the committee singles out several aspects about the
                        United States which deserve consideration in planning media products or
                        other programming projects. We know, too, that several of the Agency’s
                        elements have produced materials on some, if not all, of these subjects—but
                        we are convinced the Bicentennial years heighten the need for additional
                        concentration and more effective material. The following list of ideas
                        relates quite directly to our elements a), b) and c) set forth in paragraph
                        2 of this memorandum:</p>
                    <p>(1) The American Experience in the context of the Human Experience in the
                        search for freedom.</p>
                    <p>(2) The continuing American commitment to its Constitution; how that
                        Constitution evolved from the period we are now commemorating; and how our
                        Federal system works.</p>
                    <p>(3) Our two-party system.</p>
                    <p>(4) The role of consensus in America.</p>
                    <p>(5) Our continuing commitment to the free electoral process, as evidenced by
                        the fact that this nation has never suspended its elections in time of
                        national emergency, e.g., 1864, 1944, thus assuring an orderly process of
                        political change and continuity.</p>
                    <p>(6) Voluntarism and the concept of community—voluntary organizations and
                        movements are formed to effectuate the desires of their members, and to
                        bring about reform, change and responsiveness on the part of government.
                        Such groups are composed of people who share a common concern and are doing
                        something about it (with and without the assistance of government); doing it
                        of their own free will (citizen initiative); in response to a sense of civic
                        responsibility—and within a political framework which permits and encourages
                        such dynamism.</p>
                    <p>(7) Consumer advocates and movements—as examples of how the individual and
                        like-minded groups can bring change.</p>
                    <p>(8) Community participation in education, a tradition dating from
                        pre-independence to the present, as an expression of the nation’s commitment
                        to free and ultimately universal education.</p>
                    <pb facs="0507" n="455" xml:id="pg_455"/>
                    <p>(9) Benefits to the society and to the individual of America’s commitment to
                        a variety of forms and levels of university education.</p>
                    <p>(10) America as the “land of beginning again”, to draw upon the realities and
                        strengths of our mobility.</p>
                    <p>(11) Adaptability and Openness—not the rootless American, but the American
                        who carries his sense of identity with him, depending more upon his values
                        than his environment.</p>
                    <p>(12) The continual fluid and wide economic choices open to Americans, as
                        based on the free enterprise system celebrated by Adam Smith in 1776 in his
                        publication in that year of <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations.</hi></p>
                    <p>(13) The role of the First American, who cannot be ignored in a year
                        commemorating 1776: the Indian.</p>
                    <p>(14) The acceptance and tolerance, if not enjoyment, of change.</p>
                    <p>(15) The overseas view of America, with emphasis on the friendly and shrewd
                        criticisms of writers such as Tocqueville, Beaumont, Siegfried, Bryce,
                        Brogan, Revel, and other contemporary observers. (To illustrate that we are
                        an open and self-critical society, we also recommend holding seminars during
                        the Bicentennial to which distinguished foreign critics of America would be
                        invited.)</p>
                    <p>(16) The relationship between private enterprise and good taste, showing the
                        businessman and entrepreneur to be among those who are “creative” in the
                        sense too often narrowly restricted to the arts.</p>
                    <p>(17) The Inventor: the American as tinkerer, improver, entrepreneur of ideas,
                        and dreamer.</p>
                    <p>(18) The origins of new styles in the Arts evolving from our experimental
                        society, especially in the dance, music and architecture.</p>
                    <p>(19) Philanthropy in America.</p>

                    <p>As part of the study of “International Exchanges” sent to you on August 13,
                        1971, a separate review of foreign students was undertaken by the
                        Inter-Agency Youth Committee (<gloss target="#t_IAYC_1">IAYC</gloss>).<note

                            141</ref>.</note> This memorandum summarizes the <gloss
                            target="#t_IAYC_1">IAYC</gloss> report, previously forwarded, and
                        describes action taken by the Under Secretaries Committee.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_IAYC_1">IAYC</gloss> study focused on (a) the
                        significant increase in the number of foreign students in the U.S.—from
                        34,000 in 1955 to about 150,000 currently, (b) the fact that their U.S.
                        education will assure many from less-developed countries of access to
                        influential positions at home, and (c) the experience they receive here,
                        especially as it affects their attitudes towards the U.S. and as it relates
                        to the tasks they will undertake when they return home.</p>
                    <p>After reviewing this <gloss target="#t_IAYC_1">IAYC</gloss> study and the
                        basic study on “International Exchanges” which resulted in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 143, the Under Secretaries Committee has
                        taken the following steps:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Increased Attention and Resources</p>
                    <p>The Committee has decided that the presence here of large numbers of foreign
                        students represents a foreign policy opportunity of sufficient magnitude to
                        warrant increased attention and that such increased attention should focus
                        particularly on the more than 90 percent who are not sponsored by the <gloss
                            target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Policy Objectives</p>
                    <p>While there should be a continuing desire that foreign students meet their
                        educational goals in the U.S., the Committee has agreed that the following
                        objective should govern the design and administration of expanded <gloss
                            target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> programs for foreign students:</p>
                    <pb facs="0509" n="457" xml:id="pg_457"/>
                    <quote><p>—That foreign students should obtain a balanced understanding of the
                            U.S. with emphasis on how political, economic and social progress and
                            the resolution of conflict are sought through popular participation and
                            democratic means.</p></quote>
                    <p>The Committee has also approved two other objectives, while recognizing that
                        they would be somewhat more difficult to attain.</p>
                    <quote><p>—That foreign students should develop in the U.S. lasting and useful
                            contacts, both professional and social, that may over time strengthen
                            the links between the U.S. and other nations in key social and political
                            sectors.</p>
                        <p>—That foreign students should acquire an ability to identify and solve
                            problems in their own societies.</p></quote>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Review of Resource Allocation</p>
                    <p>It has been decided that the new interagency subcommittee on international
                        exchanges to be established in accordance with <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1"
                            >NSDM</gloss> 143 will review the relative distribution of Government
                        funds devoted to the seven percent of all foreign students who are <gloss
                            target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>-sponsored and to the remainder who are not
                        so sponsored, and to consider possible changes in this distribution. The
                        bulk of these funds is administered by the Department of State and the
                        Agency for International Development.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Program Level</p>
                    <p>It has been decided that this new interagency subcommittee will make a
                        recommendation on the specific level toward which the program undertaken by
                        the Department of State for non-<gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                        >USG</gloss>-sponsored foreign students should be expanded, taking into
                        account the recommendations and options presented by the Inter-Agency Youth
                        Committee.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Establishment of New Office</p>
                    <p>The Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs has been
                        requested to establish an Office to plan and direct approaches toward
                        foreign students, with emphasis on those here under other than <gloss
                            target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> auspices, and to seek to staff and fund
                        the new Office at a level that assures it the means to carry out innovative
                        initiatives.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. New Program Approaches</p>
                    <p>The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs has been requested to direct
                        the new Office, in carrying out its responsibilities for expanded <gloss
                            target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> attention to foreign students, to be
                        guided by the following approaches:</p>
                    <quote><p>—The stimulation of a national awareness of foreign student
                            requirements and the guiding of private programs so as to fulfill
                            approved objectives.</p>

                        <p>—Particular attention to the limited number of universities where almost
                            half the foreign students are congregated.</p>
                        <p>—A focus on carefully selected groups of foreign students of high
                            potential.</p>
                        <p>—Encouragement of continued assistance to foreign students by state
                            governments and private universities so that study opportunities are not

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Steps Being Taken</p>
                    <p>By law and by Executive Order, the Department of State is the major focal
                        point within the Federal Government for programs involving foreign students.
                        The Department’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs is also the only
                        Government agency expending funds on programs for the so-called
                        “non-sponsored” students.</p>
                    <p>The Department of State fully recognizes the importance of these foreign
                        students, and supports the <gloss target="#t_IAYC_1">IAYC</gloss>
                        recommendations for providing such students with increased Federal
                        attention. The Department’s budget for non-<gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                            >USG</gloss>-sponsored students has increased from $0.4 million in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1970 at the beginning of this
                        Administration, to a current request to Congress for $1.5 million in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1973. In addition, the Department has
                        requested in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1973 appropriations bills
                        approval for new positions which could become available to support staffing
                        increases.</p>
                    <p>As experience and opportunities warrant, and within an overall Departmental
                        resource allocation system, the Department will be expanding this
                        programming activity. At the same time, coordination efforts with other
                        Governmental agencies will be enlarged, particularly under the international
                        exchanges subcommittee of the Under Secretaries Committee, described in
                            <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 143, as well as in the

                    </list>
                    <p>After three months as Director of the Department’s Art in Embassies Program,
                        I have come to the conclusion that we do not have a thoughtful <hi
                            rend="italic">Art</hi> in Embassies Program but rather an “Art <hi
                            rend="italic">Decorating</hi> Embassies Program.”</p>
                    <p>We tend to gather unrelated objects. The ambassadors, for the most part, are
                        politically reasoned and lean toward literary ideas rather than appreciation
                        of the artistic merits of individual paintings and other artworks.</p>
                    <p>To cover U.S. interests and include the interests of the ambassadors; to
                        cover artistic interests; and even to go as far as covering U.S.
                        sociological interests, I recommend that art works be collected with a theme
                        and meaning of how one work supports another.</p>
                    <p>We should have on hand X number of collections. They should be composed of 30
                        to 40 works of art. Each collection should be on a different theme with
                        backup material intellectually thought-out. These collections would then be
                        broken down into 4 or 5 works for various rooms in different embassies,
                        resulting in X number of small groups of art works on X number of themes in
                        each embassy.</p>
                    <p>For example: After determining the ambassador’s interests and the interests
                        of X country for which a collection is being assembled I should be able to
                        say: “You need four paintings for the dining room. X country is primarily an
                        agrarian country. Here are four paintings representing our farm lands: one a
                        rural scene, one a marketing scene, one a domestic scene in an agricultural
                        area, as well as one contemporary work by an artist from a farming region.
                        You need six paintings for the drawing room. For contrast, here are six
                        paintings of New York City at various stages from 1700 to present, and, for
                        the library, X number of old political cartoons of Washington, Lincoln,
                        Jefferson, etc., which have <pb facs="0516" n="464" xml:id="pg_464"/>
                        artistic merit, but also show our historical greats had press problems.
                        Perhaps in entrance hallways: paintings and sculptures of fern, fauna, and
                        birds of the U.S. from a collection on a naturalists’ theme.”</p>
                    <p>There are a million themes to build upon:</p>
                    <p>1. Transportation—from prints of the pony express to Lester <persName

                        paintings.</p>
                    <p>2. National parks of America and ecology themes.</p>
                    <p>3. Art trends of various periods.</p>
                    <p>4. Theater, science, industrial, and architectural themes.</p>
                    <p>5. Paintings of historical events and persons. (Shouldn’t we prepare for
                        embassies to participate artistically in the Bi-Centennial-1976?)</p>
                    <p>6. Spanish American, Black American, and Immigrant American painters.</p>
                    <p>7. Portraits of American Women of every era.</p>
                    <p>And so forth and so on.</p>
                    <p>This gives the ambassador something he can get his “teeth” into to use as an
                        extension of both his and the U.S.A.’s interests, plus show a variety of
                        artistic talents.</p>
                    <p>Artists and lenders are infinitely more prone to lend a work of art if they
                        think the work is needed to contribute to a concrete idea with a specific
                        need for his work to be included, rather than being asked to loan a work to
                        cover a wall in some ambassador’s house.</p>
                    <p>No one person can be director, and curator of a museum, let alone a number of
                        mini museums scattered over the world.</p>
                    <p>Curatorial help is essential if such a program is to be put into effect. The
                        curatorial work of research, collecting, cataloging, and backup material for
                        each “theme” collection can be contracted out through museums and/or
                        universities’ Fine Arts Departments. Universities are eager for such
                        compensatory programs for their students and teachers, and the museums for
                        their younger curators in training.</p>
                    <p>I am sure both museums and universities would give guidance to the contracted
                        curator and offer research facilities. The fees for each curator to put
                        together 30 or 40 works in a collection would be between $2,000 and $2,500
                        for about a 3 months’ assignment.</p>
                    <p>There are endless sources, both private and public, to fund such a program.
                        Funds raised would be donated directly to the universities or museums and
                        tagged for this particular project, which would finally benefit the State
                        Department’s Art in Embassies Program.</p>
                    <pb facs="0517" n="465" xml:id="pg_465"/>
                    <p>An important “by product” of such an operation would be the good will and
                        better understanding that a “work together”-“help each other” situation
                        generates. Art historians need jobs and the Department, as any

                    <p>I suggest that we aim for the first organizational meeting of the
                        Subcommittee on International Exchange on or about November 20. The
                        following action must be taken before that time:</p>
                    <quote><p>1. Approval of the attached draft invitation, agenda and functional
                            statement for the committee.</p>
                        <p>2. Distribution of these papers by November 13. We should probably allow
                            about a week before meeting date to assure that the agency principals
                            can attend.</p></quote>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Organization of the work of the Subcommittee</p>
                    <p>The major projects of the Subcommittee on International Exchange should be
                        carried out by working groups drawn from the participating agencies. Some of
                        these groups should be permanent, others should be established to undertake
                        a specific project and abolished at the completion of the project.</p>
                    <p>To assure the orderly handling of the work of the Subcommittee on Exchanges,
                        I would recommend the establishment of a Working Group on Agenda and Project
                        Coordination to allow all agencies a voice in the preparation of agenda; to
                        assure that assignments are <pb facs="0520" n="468" xml:id="pg_468"/>
                        carried out; and to clarify the issues and recommendations for review and
                        approval by the Senior Group. It would be formed of a staff level person
                        designated by each agency, to be chaired by the Director, <gloss

                    <p>Another permanent Working Group that should be established at the first
                        meeting is a Science Agency Working Group to be chaired by a representative
                        of the Science Advisor’s Office (<gloss target="#t_OST_1">OST</gloss>). The
                        sixteen science or science related agencies outlined in the study should be
                        asked in a letter from you to relate to the Subcommittee’s work through the
                        Working Group.</p>
                    <p>I believe that these are the only working groups that should be established
                        at the first meeting. The Agenda and Project Coordination Working Group
                        should meet before the second Subcommittee meeting to prepare study outlines
                        and submit for review and approval a priority listing of work tasks to be
                        undertaken.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Subcommittee Work Projects</p>

                        143:</p>
                    <p>(1) Developments of methods for obtaining data from government agencies on
                        the outgoing American participants in exchange programs for inclusion in the
                        data bank.</p>
                    <p>(2) Establishment of methods and procedures for reviewing the total budget
                        request of all U.S. Government agencies in the exchange field to permit
                        recommendations regarding resource allocation for this area of government
                        activity. This should also permit identification of leadership groups where

                        students studying in the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Other projects that require early attention are:</p>
                    <p>(1) Continuation of the field work of the study on Brazil and/or West Germany
                        to determine methods for obtaining parallel coordination overseas to that of
                        the Subcommittee.</p>
                    <p>(2) A review of the spectrum of scientific disciplines included in the
                        programs of the sixteen science agencies.</p>
                    <p>These projects should be started relatively soon after the establishment of
                        the Committee so that working relations and a general sense <pb facs="0521"
                            n="469" xml:id="pg_469"/> of purpose on the part of Committee members
                        can develop. However, to establish the value of the Committee to all members
                        care should be exercised in the choice of topic studied so that the benefits
                        of coordination can be recognized by all agencies at the outset rather than
                        joining some of the more difficult issues that can be better handled after
                        the committee has developed a set of operating relationships.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> Staff Support to
                        the Subcommittee</p>
                    <p>The Committee offers the opportunity for <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>
                        to gain a broader knowledge of what is being done in all “exchange
                        activities” throughout the Government. The Committee’s activities should
                        provide opportunities for <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> staff members
                        to participate in studies with people from other Government agencies.
                        Therefore, I believe that the work of the Committee should be integrated
                        into the work of the Bureau insofar as practical, and should not be isolated
                        from ongoing day-to-day activities. (The former Federal Interagency Council
                        suffered from this isolation, and its activities had little effect on total
                        Bureau work, which generally is thought of only as moving <gloss
                            target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> grantees).</p>
                    <p>I propose the establishment of a small unit in OPP, headed by the Deputy
                        Director of OPP who will have the title, Secretary to the Subcommittee on
                        International Exchange, assisted by four officers and one secretary to fill

                    <p>Opening remarks were made by Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_REL_1"
                            >Richardson</persName>. He noted that this Administration takes an
                        active interest in international exchanges and that all indications are this
                        interest will continue. The Subcommittee should be one oriented towards
                        effective action.</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Timing of Meetings</hi></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL_1">Richardson</persName> suggested that
                        meetings of the Subcommittee be held as needed, rather than on a regularly
                        scheduled basis. This proposal was accepted by the participants.</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Staff for the Subcommittee</hi></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL_1">Richardson</persName> said a small staff for
                        the Subcommittee will be supplied by <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>.
                        This staff will be charged with coordinating the work of Subcommittee
                        Working Groups and with insuring that meaningful questions are brought to
                        the attention of the Subcommittee. No objections to <gloss target="#t_CU_1"
                            >CU</gloss> providing staff for the Subcommittee were expressed.</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Observer Attendance</hi></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL_1">Richardson</persName> stated he believed
                        attendance at Subcommittee meetings in general should be limited to
                        representatives of the agencies making up the Subcommittee. Observers should
                        be asked to attend only if their presence is required by their expertise or
                        by their specific interest in a subject being considered. This suggestion
                        was approved.</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Organizational Statement</hi></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL_1">Richardson</persName> drew the attention of
                        the participants to the Organizational Statement and invited comment. He
                        noted it is the intention of the Department of State to request that the
                        fact of the existence of the Subcommittee be declassified. Mr. McLaughlin of
                            <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> said declassification could pose a
                        psychological problem if mention is made of the Subcommittee’s relation to
                        the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>. People would be concerned over the
                        “hidden” meaning of the Committee on exchanges being tied to a <pb
                            facs="0523" n="471" xml:id="pg_471"/> national security mechanism.
                        Another suggestion was that in a declassified version of the Organizational
                        Statement less stress should be given to U.S. Government focus on leadership
                        in exchanges. It was also suggested that reference to the Exchange Study be
                        eliminated. Such reference would lead people to ask questions about the
                        exchange study which is classified Secret.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL_1">Richardson</persName> said a revised version
                        of the Organizational Statement will be prepared, incorporating suggestions
                        made at the meeting. The revised Organizational Statement will be sent to
                        the participants for comment prior to any action being taken on
                        declassifying it.</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Working Groups</hi></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL_1">Richardson</persName> said a working group
                        on agenda and project coordination should be established. This would be a
                        working group of the whole, chaired by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRL_1"
                            >Richard L. Roth</persName>. This proposal was accepted by the
                        participants.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL_1">Richardson</persName> also suggested that a
                        Working Group on scientific exchanges be established. This suggestion was
                        accepted.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRL_1">Roth</persName> commented that participants
                        should feel free to suggest topics for the consideration of the Agenda
                        Working Group. They should not be limited to suggested areas of concern
                        appearing in the Exchange Study.</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Briefing on Data Bank</hi></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRL_1">Roth</persName> spoke briefly on plans for
                        the creation of a data bank, describing the system for collecting and
                        analyzing information from exchange (J) visa applications. There was general
                        agreement that data should be collected as of the present only because of
                        the infeasibility of obtaining data covering the past. Miss Horn commented
                        that recovery of data on past <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>
                        activities was possible. However, such an effort would be so costly it could
                        not be justified in terms of benefits derived. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HAS_1">Hoffman</persName> stressed that we should not
                        discard past records altogether and that some effort should be made to
                        retain whatever we have in the way of historical material covering
                        exchanges. The question was asked whether there was an intention to set up a
                        data bank for non-government sponsored exchanges. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_REL_1">Richardson</persName> said this was one of the
                        anticipated objectives of the proposed Private Council referred to in <gloss

                        monumental undertaking which might have to be approached eventually through
                        a variety of data banks operating on different elements of the private
                        sector.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRL_1">Roth</persName> informed the group of the

                    </list>
                    <p>American Folk singer Pete Seeger concluded his latest tour of the Soviet
                        Union with a recital November 20 before an audience of 1700 Soviet and
                        foreign students in the ornate main auditorium of Moscow State University.
                        He had already appeared under Goskontsert auspices in Novosibirsk, Irkutsk
                        and Komerova.</p>
                    <p>Appearing without benefit of any special lighting or staging, and with only a
                        fair sound system but a good interpreter, he got a warm reception for a
                        mixed concert of recognized favorites (The Hammer Song, Freight Train, We
                        Shall Overcome, Hush, Little Baby, and Let There Be Sunshine); straight and
                        not so straight anti-war songs (Last Train to Nuremberg, and two of his own
                        compositions: To <persName corresp="#p_HCM_1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>, and
                        Land of 1000 Songs); and a miscellany including songs in favor of
                        controlling pollution and population. The most unusual item was a song about
                        a Jewish Collective Farmer in the Ukraine, one verse <pb facs="0525" n="473"
                            xml:id="pg_473"/> of which was in Yiddish, which was greeted by mixed
                        laughter and confusion.</p>
                    <p>Despite several enthusiastic tries, Seeger was unable to raise the students
                        into any kind of audience participation, and should perhaps have known
                        Soviet audiences well enough not to try. He did get outbreaks of rhythmic
                        applause for some of his more acid lyrics, such as the linking of the names
                        of Calley, Medina, Custer and <persName corresp="#p_NP_1">Nixon</persName>,
                        as well as both houses of Congress, in Last Train to Nuremberg, but
                        generally the audience was most favorable to the non-polemical songs it
                        recognized. Aside from several comments about not being allowed to present
                        protest songs on American television, Seeger limited his non-singing remarks
                        to ecological problems and his own resolve to give up concerts for a year
                        and return to his home near New York to work on community problems. (An
                        American correspondent in the audience at Novosibirsk reported that his
                        polemical remarks there were long enough to get in the way of the
                        singing.)</p>
                    <p>The effect on the Moscow audience must have been as mixed as the program. The
                        performer they had come to see (and tickets were hard to get) was obviously
                        opposed to his own government and some other aspects of American life, but
                        he was just as obviously free to travel and prosper, and he was planning to
                        work within the system, even volunteering that his “dirty stream”, the
                        Hudson River, was already getting cleaner. And, his third and last encore
                        closed with the ambiguous line: “I know that you who hear my singing can
                        make those freedom bells go ringing.”</p>

                        <salute>Dear Frank:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>We have taken another look at a subject which, for some time, has been a
                        matter of concern both to us in the Department and to you in <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, “The <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                        Image Problem in Western European Media”. I am pleased to send you a copy of
                        a paper we have just prepared on this subject.<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2"
                            >Enclosed but not printed is a paper entitled “The U.S. Image Problem in
                            Western European Media.”</note></p>
                    <p>As the paper makes clear, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> as well as
                        the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs in the Department have given
                        a good deal of attention to this problem and have been working at it with
                        some success. The paper does, however, offer a number of suggestions for
                        further action by the Department, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and
                        our Embassies in Western Europe. The recommendations, I am informed, have
                        been cleared informally with appropriate elements of <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>I appreciate the considerable effort which <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> along with the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs
                        have already made in dealing with the problem. As the paper points out, we
                        would be well advised to put additional resources into this effort if we
                        wish to make more headway in coping with the situation. The recommendations
                        strike me as being reasonable and constructive.</p>
                    <p>I have already requested the <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_EUR_1">EUR</gloss> Bureaus of the Department to carry out
                        those recommendations that are within their jurisdictions. Since some of
                        these proposals necessarily involve action by your Agency, I hope that the
                        Department and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> can cooperate in
                        putting them into effect.</p>
                    <p>I believe that concerted action by the Department, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1"
                            >USIA</gloss> and the Embassies, even if it may not completely eliminate
                        the problem, can go a long way toward reducing its dimensions.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>
