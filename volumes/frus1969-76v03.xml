                <p>The first <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration’s policies
                    to stabilize the U.S. economy and to reform the international monetary system
                    are the main themes of Foreign Relations of the United States, 1969-1976, Volume
                    III, Foreign Economic Policy, 1969-1972; International Monetary Policy,
                    1969-1972, released on March 7, 2002, by the Department of State. The volume,
                    which is part of the ongoing official record of American foreign policy, is the
                    first published in the subseries of the Foreign Relations series that will
                    document the foreign policies of the administrations of Presidents <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName> and Gerald Ford.</p>
                <p>The first compilation of documents deals primarily with U.S. balance-of-payments
                    policy and relations with the major industrial countries, particularly France,
                    Germany, the United Kingdom, the European Community as a whole, and Japan. One
                    of the first directives of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    administration was the establishment of a permanent working group chaired by
                    Under Secretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs <persName corresp="#p_VPA1"
                        >Paul Volcker</persName> to make recommendations on international monetary
                    policy. The <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> Group became a major
                    player in formulating balance-of-payments and international monetary policy.</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration was predisposed
                    toward macroeconomic monetary and fiscal measures to address balance-of-payments
                    problems, in lieu of microeconomic measures favored by the Johnson
                    administration. But as the new administration sought to phase out the latter
                    some abroad saw a U.S. policy of "benign neglect" to the balance of payments.
                    When it adopted a firm balance-of-payments target during the monetary crisis of
                    August-September 1971, however, foreign observers were concerned and thought it
                    excessive.</p>
                <p>Military expenditures abroad were a factor in the balance of payments, and
                    Senator Mansfield introduced legislation to reduce the American military
                    presence abroad to help the balance of payments. The administration rejected
                    this approach and instead negotiated "offset agreements" with Germany in 1969
                    and 1971 to mitigate the balance of payments impact of the U.S. forces stationed
                    there. Burden sharing negotiations were also held in a multilateral, NATO-wide
                    context.</p>
                <p>The United States fully supported further expansion of the European Community but
                    opposed the Community’s association agreements with a number of Mediterranean
                    countries as inconsistent with its <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                    obligations and detrimental to U.S. exports.</p>
                <p>During several summits with Prime Ministers and many Ministerial consultations,
                    U.S. and Japanese officials explored balance-of-payments and exchange rate
                    issues, trade balances and trade policies toward specific commodities, defense
                    costs, and the contributions Japan could make to economic assistance of
                    developing countries, particularly in the Pacific region.</p>
                <p>The second compilation of documents in this volume deals with the composition of
                    international reserve assets, changing exchange rates, and proposals for
                    international monetary reform. The United States sought activation of the new
                    Special Drawing Rights in the International Monetary Fund, and saw the <gloss
                        target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> taking pressure off the dollar as a reserve
                    asset. The <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Board approved a 3-year program
                    to create $9.5 million of <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s in September
                    1969. The United States also welcomed devaluation of the French franc in August
                    1969 and the appreciation of the German mark in October 1969, but its quest for
                    greater, albeit "limited exchange rate flexibility" was thwarted until partially
                    realized with the resolution of the monetary crisis in 1971.</p>
                <p>On August 15, 1971, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    announced his New Economic Policy, which suspended the convertibility of the
                    dollar to gold, imposed a 10 percent tax on imports; and reduced foreign
                    assistance expenditures by 10 percent. The compilation contains many documents
                    explaining the development of this policy and identifying the major players. The
                    cessation of dollar-gold convertibility and sudden floating of the dollar, i.e.,
                    devaluation, had special impact on U.S. foreign relations. Following
                    announcement of the NEP there was a flurry of consultations: <gloss
                        target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> Deputies and Ministerial meetings, bilateral
                    consultations, and the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>-Pompidou
                    Azores Summit that produced the agreement at the <gloss target="#t_G101"
                        >G-10</gloss> Smithsonian Institution Ministerial.</p>
                <p>The Smithsonian-agreed new exchange rates with wider margins of intervention did
                    not hold long, and Britain allowed the pound to float in June 1972. President
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Prime Minister Heath agreed
                    that fundamental, long-term changes were required in the international monetary
                    system. The <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> annual meeting in September 1972
                    established the <gloss target="#t_C201">C-20</gloss>, an advisory committee to
                    the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Board, to work on all aspects of reform
                    of the system.</p>

                <p>Since 1861, the Department of State’s documentary series Foreign Relations of the
                    United States has constituted the official record of the foreign policy and
                    diplomacy of the United States. Historians at the Office of the Historian
                    collect, select, arrange, and annotate the principal documents that make up the
                    record of American foreign policy. The standards for preparation of the series
                    and general guidelines for the publication are established by the Foreign

                </p>
                <p>On January 18, 1969, Arthur Burns, who would be Counselor to the President until
                    appointed Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in 1970, forwarded to
                    President-elect <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> one of a series of
                    Transition Task Force reports, this one dealing with balance-of-payments
                    policies. The Task Force report called <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName>’s attention to the precarious U.S. balance-of-payments
                    position and the de facto inconvertibility of the dollar to gold. (1)</p>
                <p>On January 21, 1969, the President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs,
                    Henry Kissinger, issued National Security Study Memorandum (NSSM) 5 informing
                    addressees that the President had mandated a review of the full range of
                    U.S.-Japanese issues that would include trade and "US balance of payments
                    considerations, particularly the implication of US military expenditures in
                    Japan." (20)</p>
                <p>On the same day, Kissinger sent <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 7 to
                    Secretary of State William Rogers and Secretary of the Treasury David Kennedy,
                    Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors Paul McCracken, and Chairman of the
                    Federal Reserve Board William McChesney Martin, informing them that the
                    President had directed the creation of a permanent working group, chaired by
                    Under Secretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs Paul Volcker, "make
                    recommendations on U.S. international monetary policy to the <gloss
                        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and to implement policy decisions." (109) The
                        <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> Group, successor to the
                    Deming Group of the Johnson administration, met frequently and was a major
                    player in formulating U.S. balance-of-payments and international monetary policy
                    during the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration.</p>
                <p>Economic policy issues were among those addressed from the outset of the
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration. This first
                    compilation deals primarily with U.S. balance-of-payments policy and relations
                    with the major industrial countries, particularly France, Germany, the United
                    Kingdom, the European Community as a whole, and Japan. As these policy issues
                    were developed, issues related to international trade policy, foreign economic
                    and military assistance, and relations with developing countries inevitably came
                    up and are prominent in a number of documents in this volume, but their
                    systematic treatment is in Volume IV, scheduled for publication in 2002.</p>
                <p>The second compilation in this volume, International Monetary Policy, 1969-1972,
                    is closely related to balance-of-payments issues and relations with the major
                    industrial democracies.</p>
                <p>Foreign Economic Policy, 1969-1972</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration inherited a
                    number of programs from the Johnson administration aimed at improving the U.S.

                        >REDCOSTE</gloss> (Reduction of Costs in Europe) was replaced by <gloss

                    July 1969 ordered a reduction by 10 percent in civilian overseas employment by
                    government agencies. (2, 22, 25) The new administration disliked other Johnson
                    administration policies, such as the interest equalization tax and limitations
                    on direct foreign investment by U.S. corporations, and from the outset it
                    launched plans for their mitigation and removal, despite concerns that other
                    nations would be upset. (3-6, 8, 10-12, 14-16, 54) True to expectations, there
                    were misgivings abroad about the "benign neglect" of the U.S. balance of
                    payments. (29, 63)</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration was predisposed
                    toward macroeconomic monetary and fiscal policy measures to address the
                    balance-of-payments problem, in lieu of more microeconomic policies. A March 17,
                    1969, Treasury Department paper argued that "the main thrust in our balance of
                    payments adjustment will be on general measures rather than selective controls."
                    (10) Precise goals and measureswere difficult to set, however. In a March 26,
                    1969, memorandum to Kissinger regarding Secretary Rogers’ testimony before the

                    wrote: "There is no U.S. policy to ‘eliminate our balance of payments deficit’.
                    The Johnson Administration sought a ‘sustainable balance’…. This Administration
                    has not yet stated its objective … and the Secretary of State should definitely
                    not say that ‘we are taking every feasible step to eliminate our deficit’."
                    (2)</p>
                <p>The administration worked to formulate a balance-of-payments policy (25, 27, 29,
                    31-33, 39, 48, 63, 66), and during the international monetary policy crisis in
                    August-September 1971, the administration finally adopted a clear objective, at
                    least a $13 billion swing in the U.S. goods and services balance (about 1.3
                    percent of nominal GDP in 1971), as set out in a September 10, 1971, Treasury
                    Department paper. (76) Despite earlier concerns about benign neglect of the U.S.
                    balance of payments, the foreign reaction to this U.S. objective now was that it
                    was too ambitious. (78)</p>
                <p>A major concern during the Johnson and <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administrations was the impact of U.S. military
                    expenditures abroad on the U.S. balance of payments. The concern was also
                    frequently expressed in Congress where legislation, the Mansfield amendment, was
                    introduced from time to time to reduce significantly the U.S. military presence
                    in Europe to alleviate the U.S. balance of payments. (2, 48, 156) While both
                    administrations resisted this legislation, the concern was real, and the United
                    States negotiated offset agreements with Germany to provide balance-of-payments
                    relief to the United States for the costs of maintaining the U.S. military
                    presence there. The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration
                    signed a first offset agreement on July 9, 1969 (13, 24, 45), and a second on
                    December 10, 1971. (50, 68, 86) These were bilateral agreements with Germany
                    alone, but forces were set in motion for a broader, NATO-wide burden sharing of
                    defense expenditures. (45, 46, 50, 78, 84)</p>
                <p>By 1969 Western Europe and Japan had recovered from the devastation of World War
                    II and the view was emerging in the United States that both should more fully
                    share in responsibility for international economic adjustment, military
                    expenditures, and assistance to developing countries. As the documentation in
                    the volume on balance-of-payments adjustment and international monetary policy
                    demonstrates, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration
                    sought greater responsibility by others in many facets of international economic
                    policies. The administration was fully supportive of continued expansion of the
                    European Community (40, 47), and President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> told French President Georges Pompidou, during a White
                    House meeting on February 26, 1970, that the latter should give no credence to
                    statements "concerning fears and even opposition to the European Community by
                    the United States." (36) In late 1972 a major policy review of relations with
                    the Community set out the policy clearly: "US policy has been to support Western
                    European economic integration as a means to strengthen Western European ability
                    to share responsibility for maintaining a stable and prosperous world order."
                    (108)</p>
                <p>The Community, nonetheless, was a source of serious concern on a number of policy
                    fronts. One major issue was the preferential trading relationships the Community
                    was developing with Spain, Israel, Tunisia, and Morocco, which U.S. officials
                    saw as inconsistent with Community <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                    obligations and potentially damaging to U.S. exports. (40, 42, 43, 47) This
                    issue festered without resolution until the end of the first <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration. (101-106, 108) Another
                    vexing issue was the border tax adjustments that various European nations made
                    for their value added taxes, the relationship of these border tax adjustments to
                    exchange rate policies, and their compatibility with <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                        >GATT</gloss> rules. (41)</p>
                <p>Commenting on the policy paper prepared in response to <gloss target="#t_NSSM1"
                        >NSSM</gloss> 5 regarding relations with Japan (20), the Treasury Department
                    position was that "Japan’s great economic and financial strength is new and the
                    Japanese themselves are not yet accustomed to it…. The Treasury believes that
                    [the paper] does not give adequate attention to the relative sharing of costs
                    and benefits of the U.S.-Japanese partnership… It is the Treasury view that
                    Japan is not carrying an equitable share of the financial burden of the
                    partnership, either budgetary or balance of payments." (17) In the paper itself,
                    the authors recognized that trade, balance-of-payments, and aid policy issues
                    were "an integral part of Japan policy and that they should be considered,
                    particularly in developing a negotiating position on Okinawa." (20) While
                    economic policymakers recognized that reversion of Okinawa was a separate issue
                    from the trade, exchange rate, foreign assistance, and balance-of-payments
                    issues that were on the bilateral economic agenda, at least an implied linkage
                    of progress on both fronts surfaced from time to time within the administration,
                    as well as in Congress. (23, 75, 87)</p>
                <p>During a September 10, 1971, meeting with the Japanese Finance Minister in
                    Washington, Treasury Secretary John Connally, who succeeded <persName

                    Minister that the problems between the United States and Japan were divisible
                    into three areas: the cost of defense, trade restrictions, and exchange rates.
                        <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> thought the first two
                    should be handled in bilateral negotiations but the third would have to be
                    worked out in a multilateral context. (77)</p>
                <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had several meetings with
                    Japanese Prime Ministers. On November 20, 1969, during his State visit to
                    Washington, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> told Prime Minister
                        <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> that "Japan was now at a point
                    where it could play a greater role … not just in Asia but on the world scene …
                    [and] the world would be healthier if Japan could be added ‘as a fifth finger’
                    to the four existing areas of great power, the United States, Western Europe,
                    the Soviet Union and China." (30) <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    and <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> also met at San Clemente on
                    January 6-7, 1972. On the economic agenda they briefly exchanged views on
                    defense burden sharing and Japan’s plans to increase its foreign economic
                    assistance. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> suggested
                    that the great economic powers of the Free World—the United States, Japan,
                    Germany, Britain, and France and, possibly Canada and Italy—should "look at the
                    world as a whole … [and] consult closely if we are to build a stable and
                    productive Free World economy with trade and monetary stability." (87) Prime
                    Minster <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> supported the idea of a
                    conference of major powers.</p>
                <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> met with the new Japanese
                    Prime Minister, <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Kakuei Tanaka</persName>, in Oahu,
                    Hawaii on August 31, 1972, after extensive preparations. (92, 93, 95-98) The
                    Prime Minister recognized that an excessive trade imbalance served neither
                    countries’ interests, and would do his best to reduce the current bilateral
                    imbalance. Nonetheless, he said Japan wanted to maintain an overall current
                    account surplus of one percent of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> to finance
                    foreign assistance to developing countries by a like amount. He suggested
                    specific Japanese cooperation in Southeast Asia and Korea on both foreign
                    assistance and investment. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> said a healthy Japanese economy was in the United States’
                    interest and, recognizing Japan had a problem with playing a military role in
                    Asia, Japan’s economic influence could be decisive in the region. (99)</p>

                <p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s U.S. policymakers anticipated policy responses
                    to international currency crises, a run on U.S. gold reserves, and possible
                    measures to restructure fundamentally the international monetary system. Despite
                    the exchange rate stability that had been a cornerstone of <gloss

                    actively considered currency devaluations and appreciations, suspending the
                    dollar’s convertibility to gold and changing the official monetary price of
                    gold. (110) President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> on several
                    occasions specifically expressed his interest in a "new international monetary

                    administration, had directed preparation of a paper on international monetary
                    policy to be considered by the National Security Council (NSC). (109) The <gloss
                        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting was cancelled but the study papers were
                    taken up in other fora, including a meeting with President <persName

                    119, 123-125, 128-131) Among the options considered on June 26 were activation
                    of the new reserve asset, the Special Drawing Rights (<gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                        >SDR</gloss>s) approved by the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Board in

                <p>During the spring and summer of 1969, a number of consultations advanced the
                    agenda on <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> activation. (112, 113, 120, 132,
                    133) A July 23-24 <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> Deputies meeting reached
                    agreement on a 3-year plan to create $9.5 billion of the new reserve asset.
                    (135) The <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Board ratified the agreement on
                    October 3. (140)</p>
                <p>France devalued the franc on August 8, 1969. (123, 136) Germany allowed the mark
                    to float on September 30, 1969; the mark was formally appreciated by 9.29
                    percent on October 24. (126, 139, 140, 143)</p>
                <p>The U.S. proposal for increased exchange rate flexibility, albeit still in the
                    context of fixed parities, encountered resistance. (121, 127, 137, 138, 147)
                    During U.S.-French Ministerial-level consultations on international economic
                    issues at Camp David May 3-5, 1970, the U.S. side said it was not advocating
                    freely floating rates, but only a change in attitudes to be less rigid toward
                    exchange rate changes. The French argued that it was "not clear whether widening
                    exchange margins would discourage or encourage speculation" and, in any event
                    existing <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Articles were no obstacle to "small
                    and frequent" parity adjustments. (146) Work on the issue went forward during
                    the summer and fall of 1970 and into 1971, but without resolution. (148, 149,
                    157, 162, 163)</p>
                <p>Following the exchange rate adjustments in 1969, foreign exchange markets were
                    relatively quiet (147), although U.S. policymakers continued to consider
                    additional adjustment measures. (150, 151) Faced with roiled foreign exchange
                    markets in early May 1971 (151), the Treasury Department on May 8 prepared a
                    paper entitled "Contingency." (152) The paper proposed that the United States
                    take advantage of the current crisis to achieve a lasting improvement in the
                    U.S. balance of payments, a more equitable sharing of responsibilities for world
                    security and economic progress, and a basic reform of the international monetary
                    system. Among the measures proposed were suspension of gold convertibility,
                    imposition of trade restrictions, and a reduction of the U.S. military presence
                    in Europe and Japan.</p>
                <p>During the spring and into the summer of 1971, the administration struggled to
                    deal with crisis in foreign exchange issues. (154-161) As the crisis progressed,
                    President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> met with Treasury

                    principals the next day to agree on policy. (165) The meeting was held in great
                    secrecy at Camp David on August 13-15, 1971. August 13 briefing memoranda from
                    their staffs to Rogers and Kissinger on the current crisis gave no indication
                    that the staffs were aware of the Camp David meeting. (166, 167) The State
                    Department and the National Security Council were not represented at Camp David
                    where, according to Kissinger, "a decision of major foreign policy importance
                    had been taken about which neither the Secretary of State nor the national
                    security adviser had been consulted." (168)</p>
                <p>The New Economic Policy that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> announced on August 15, 1971, had both domestic and
                    international elements. On the international side the NEP closed the gold
                    window, the suspension of convertibility essentially floating the dollar. It
                    imposed a 10 percent surcharge on all dutiable imports, a measure described as a
                    border tax adjustment during preparatory meetings, and reduced foreign
                    assistance expenditures by 10 percent. (168) The sudden floating of the dollar
                    had special impact on U.S. foreign relations. Under Secretary <persName
                        corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> traveled to Europe for consultations on
                    August 16 and 17 to explain the new U.S. program to European and Japanese
                    officials. (170, 171) During the week following the NEP’s announcement, most
                    foreign exchange markets remained closed as governments absorbed the new
                    policies and explored next steps. (172)</p>
                <p>The <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> Deputies met in Paris on September 3,
                    followed by a <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> Ministerial in London
                    September 15-16 to consider next steps. (173-175) Among the topics discussed was
                    the U.S. objective to obtain a $13 billion turnaround in the balance on goods
                    and services. (76, 78) There was no resolution and bilateral consultations and
                        <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> Deputies and Ministerial meetings
                    during the fall sought agreement on a policy approach. The United States
                    continued to develop its negotiating strategy and policy objectives. (176-197,
                    199-209) On November 2 President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    informed his advisers the presumption should be that there would be no change in
                    the price of gold nor a return to some form of convertibility. (189)</p>
                <p>On November 23-24, 1971, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    had several meetings with his economic advisers, preparatory to meetings of the
                        <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> Deputies and Ministers in Rome November
                    29-December 1. (203) During those meetings they discussed the French gold
                    "phobia" and the probable need for a change in the official price of gold, the
                    magnitude of possible exchange rate changes, and the possibility of trading the
                    import surcharge for sufficient exchange rate realignments. Press reports
                    following the November 23-24 meetings noted that the President expected
                    "definite progress" at the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss>
                    meetings. Gold price issues are documented in this volume. (145, 153)</p>
                <p>The <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> meetings in Rome made substantial
                    progress on the scope of exchange rate realignments and trade and burden sharing
                    issues related to U.S. objectives. Treasury Secretary <persName
                        corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> on behalf of the United States put
                    the hypothetical of a change in the official price of gold on the table, an
                    offer that apparently caught some in Washington by surprise. (212) Nonetheless,
                    sufficient progress was made on resolution of outstanding issues that the stage
                    was set for a Summit between Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> that
                    would permit another <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> Ministerial later in
                    December to reach agreement on resolution of the issues that had vexed the
                    international economic community during the latter half of 1971. (210-216)</p>
                <p>Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName
                        corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> met in the Azores December 13-14, 1971.
                    At a breakfast meeting with President <persName corresp="#p_PG5"
                        >Pompidou</persName> on December 14, Kissinger marked up a draft set of
                    undertakings that he had drawn up in consultation with Connally. (219) That
                    markup was the basis for the "Framework for Monetary and Trade Settlement"
                    signed by the two Presidents after they resolved final details later in the day.
                    (220) The United States agreed to drop the 10 percent import surcharge and
                    increase the official monetary price of gold from $35 to $38 per ounce. France
                    would leave its gold parity unchanged (thereby allowing the franc to appreciate
                    against the dollar, in French parlance devaluing the dollar), and the two
                    Presidents anticipated that the mark and yen would appreciate as well. Provision
                    would also be made for 2.25 percent margins for exchange rate fluctuations above
                    and below the new exchange rates (accomplishing the U.S. objective of limited
                    exchange rate flexibility).</p>
                <p>The <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> Ministers again met on December 17-18,
                    1971, at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. At that meeting they
                    essentially agreed to new exchange rates, at fixed parities, along the lines
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PG5"
                        >Pompidou</persName> suggested at the Azores Summit, and agreed to work out
                    modalities for increasing intervention margins from 1.0 to 2.25 percent. (221,
                    222) Despite the new agreement, international financial flows thwarted
                    maintenance of the new parities during early 1972. (222)</p>
                <p>On February 4, 1972, President <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName>
                    wrote President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> about his concerns
                    that measures they had agreed on during the Azores Summit had not, "for the
                    moment come into play." Among Pompidou’s concerns was the fact that Congress had
                    not yet been asked to increase the monetary price of gold, thereby legally
                    devaluing the dollar, a measure he now understood, after a February 3 message
                    from Connally, would soon be forthcoming. (223) In his February 16 reply,
                    President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> cast recent developments
                    in a positive light and noted that the legislation to devalue the dollar had
                    been forwarded to Congress a week earlier. (224)</p>
                <p>Faced with ongoing instability in foreign exchange markets, U.S. policymakers
                    continued to develop positions on more fundamental, long-term reform in the
                    international monetary system. As discussions in the European Community and the
                        <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> addressed the issues, proposals for
                    what would become the <gloss target="#t_C201">C-20</gloss>, a committee of the
                        <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, emerged that would consider fundamental
                    reform of the international monetary system, bringing developing countries into
                    the negotiations. (225-231)</p>
                <p>By June 1972 Great Britain was no longer able to defend the new parity for the
                    pound that was thus allowed to float on June 23. Prime Minister Edward Heath, in
                    a June 26 message to President Nixon, thought it was time "to think in terms of
                    much more radical changes than we had as yet envisaged" for reform of the
                    international monetary system. (232) In his July 10 reply to Heath, President
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> agreed that "this latest
                    episode in a series of monetary crises over recent years illustrates the need
                    for fundamental changes in the monetary framework." <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> said that ever since August 15 he had thought it important
                    to establish the point that it was necessary "to go beyond a simple patching up
                    of the Bretton Woods system." (233)</p>
                <p>In mid-July 1972 Treasury Secretary Shultz, who had replaced <persName
                        corresp="#p_CJBJ1">John Connally</persName> in June (90, 232), sent a
                    memorandum to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> informing
                    him of recent speculative pressures in foreign exchange markets and cautioned
                    him that if the United States were seen as playing too passive a role in
                    defending the Smithsonian Agreement exchange rates it "would be a poor launching
                    pad for a constructive trans-Atlantic dialogue on longer-term reform." (234,
                    240) On July 20, 1972, German Minister of Finance and Economics <persName
                        corresp="#p_SH1">Helmut Schmidt</persName> told Kissinger that it was
                    necessary to defend the Smithsonian Agreement, at least until the U.S. elections
                    in November. Kissinger noted that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1"
                        >Shultz</persName> "thinks floating is the right policy" but promised to
                    take the matter up with him and Federal Reserve Chairman Burns. (235)</p>
                <p>On July 25, 1972, Kissinger and Burns had a tour d’horizon on international
                    economic issues. Kissinger told Burns of Schmidt’s interest in restoration of
                    convertibility but Burns thought this impossible at the time. Burns told
                    Kissinger: "We have an opportunity to rebuild the world…. The <gloss
                        target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> has been the only thing which stands for
                    international law in the monetary area. There should be established the
                    principle of symmetry between deficit and surplus nations. Right now, when a
                    country has a deficit, it is an international sin. With a surplus, it is
                    practicing an international virtue…. We should establish rules … that surplus
                    countries have an obligation to reduce and eliminate surpluses and deficit
                    countries have a similar obligation to reduce their deficits. (236) At the end
                    of July, under the rubric "Major Elements of Plan X," the Treasury Department
                    set out additional thinking on an exchange rate regime, a reserve asset regime,
                    and a constitutional regime that might include a "completely new international
                    monetary agreement … covering monetary and related broad trade principles."
                    (239)</p>
                <p>On August 4, 1972, Treasury Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1"
                        >Shultz</persName> sent a telegraphic message to his French counterpart
                    explaining U.S. perceptions on shortcomings in a paper under preparation for the
                        <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> annual meeting in September. The French
                    continued to resist increased exchange rate flexibility and sought an increased
                    role for gold, and <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> thought the
                    draft report offered an inadequate "range of realistic options for an
                    appropriate reform of the international economic and monetary systems."
                    (241)</p>
                <p>The <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> held its 1972 annual meeting in
                    Washington in late September. One decision at the meeting was creation of the
                        <gloss target="#t_C201">C-20</gloss>, an advisory committee on "all aspects
                    of reform of the international monetary system, including those that involve
                    international trade, the flow of capital, investment and development
                    assistance." The Indonesian Finance Minister, Ali Wardhana, was elected the
                        <gloss target="#t_C201">C-20</gloss> Chairman at its first meeting on
                    September 28. (237) President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and
                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> both addressed the
                    annual meeting calling for linkages between trade and monetary reform and
                    "changes in reserves as a presumptive indicator of the need to make exchange
                    rate adjustments." World press reaction to their speeches was described as
                    "mixed but generally positive." (242, 243)</p>

                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans, researches,
                    compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Official regulations codifying
                    specific standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series
                    were first promulgated by Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925.
                    These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by

                    and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section
                    198 of P.L. 102-138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State’s Basic

                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the

                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the

                    strategic policy, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and his
                    Assistant for National Security Affairs, Henry Kissinger, did not express much
                    interest in foreign economic matters. They nonetheless understood that domestic
                    and foreign economic developments could have profound effects on their political
                    programs and goals. In particular, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administration inherited a serious U.S.
                    balance-of-payments deficit, which threatened to destabilize the international
                    economic system. During the first term, 1969-1972, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administration officials undertook an intensive
                    re-evaluation of U.S. monetary and trade policies. From this reappraisal came
                    several foreign economic initiatives, many of which were formulated in the
                    Department of the Treasury, to try to stop the flow of U.S. capital abroad.</p>
                <p>The first part of this volume documents the various foreign economic options that
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration officials
                    considered in trying to alleviate the balance-of-payments problem. Some of the
                    following proposals were stillborn, but others became <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration initiatives: reduction in
                    non-military U.S. personnel stationed overseas; efforts to get Japan and
                    especially West Germany to offset the costs of the U.S. military presence abroad
                    with the purchase of more U.S. military equipment; reduction in the Interest
                    Equalization Tax; revaluation of exchange rates of countries with trade
                    surpluses; opposition to foreign governments’ preferential trade policies;
                    reductions in foreign aid; and reform of the international monetary system.</p>
                <p>The second part of this volume treats the administration’s interest in reform of
                    the international monetary system. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> and his economic advisers increasingly believed that the
                    creation of a new economic system could alleviate major U.S. fiscal problems,
                    such as tariff inequities and declining gold reserves. One proposal called for
                    major European nations’ acceptance of the International Monetary Fund’s plan of
                    Special Drawing Rights (<gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s). Another called
                    for flexible exchange rates. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    administration officials hoped to persuade individual countries, especially <pb
                        n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>in Europe, to devalue or revalue their
                    currencies, abolish fund controls, and agree on common trading rules, all of
                    which would avert a large-scale financial crisis and promote international
                    trade. Ultimately, the collapse of the British pound and European disagreements
                    over currency revaluation prompted President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> to announce his New Economic Policy in August 1971, which
                    ended the convertibility of dollars to gold and imposed a 10 percent surcharge
                    on imports, as well as imposing domestic wage and price controls for 90
                    days.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Memoranda of
                    conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents
                    within the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the
                    editors for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
                    each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed with headings, source notes, and number
                    of pages not declassified in their chronological place. All brackets that appear
                    in the source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the source of the document,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>

                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from

                    (PRMPA) of 1974 (44 <gloss target="#t_USC1">USC</gloss> 2111 note), the National
                    Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has custody of the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential historical materials. The
                    requirements of the PRMPA and implementing regulations govern access to the

                    materials. The PRMPA and implementing public access regulations require NARA to
                    review for additional restrictions in order to ensure the protection of the
                    privacy rights of former <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White
                    House officials, since these officials were not given the opportunity to
                    separate their personal materials from public papers. Thus, the PRMPA and
                    implementing public access regulations require NARA formally to notify the

                <p>The Information Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs and Services,
                    Bureau of Administration, Department of State, conducted the declassification
                    review for the State Department of the documents published in this volume. The
                    review was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth in Executive
                    Order 12958 on Classified National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments.</p>
                <p>The final declassification review of this volume, which began in 1999 and was
                    completed in 2001, resulted in the decision to withhold about .03 percent of the
                    documentation proposed for publication; no documents were withheld in full. The
                    editor is confident, on the basis of the research conducted in preparing this
                    volume and as a result of the declassification review process described above,
                    that the documentation and editorial notes presented here provide an accurate
                    account of U.S. general foreign economic policies and U.S. monetary policy from
                    1969 to 1972.</p>

                    provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign policy decisions and
                    significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires that government
                    agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in
                    foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the Department
                    of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to
                    foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected
                    records. Many of the sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have
                    been declassified and are available for review at the National Archives and
                    Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the

                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between

                    Administration at College Park, Maryland (Archives II). Many of the Department’s
                    decentralized office (or lot) files covering the 1969-1976 period, which the
                    National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred or

                <p>Access to the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White House tape
                    recordings is governed by the terms of the Presidential Recordings and Materials
                    Preservation Act (P.L. 93-526; 88 Stat. 1695) and an access agreement with the
                    Office of Presidential Libraries of the National Archives and Records
                    Administration and the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> estate. In
                    February 1971 President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> initiated a
                    voice activated taping system in the Oval Office of the White House and,
                    subsequently, in the President’s Office in the Executive Office Building, Camp
                    David, the Cabinet Room, and White House and Camp David telephones. The
                    audiotapes include conversations of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> with his Assistant for National Security Affairs <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>, other White House aides,
                    Secretary of State Rogers, other Cabinet officers, members of Congress, and key
                    foreign officials. The clarity of the voices on the tape recordings is often
                    very poor, but the editors make every effort to try to verify the accuracy of
                    the conversations. Readers are urged to consult the recordings for a full
                    appreciation of those aspects of the discussions that cannot be fully captured
                    in a transcription, such as the speakers’ inflections and emphases that may
                    convey nuances of meaning, as well as the larger context of the discussion.</p>
                <p>Research for this volume was completed through special access to restricted
                    documents at the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential
                    Materials Project. While all the material printed in this volume has been
                    declassified, some of it is extracted from still-classified documents. The
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials Staff is
                    processing and declassifying many of the documents used in this volume, but they
                    may not be available in their entirety at the time of publication.</p>

                </p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editor made extensive use of Presidential papers
                    and other White House records at the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials Project. The bulk of the foreign
                    policy records at the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Project are
                    in the National Security Council Files. Within the National Security Council
                    Files, the Agency, Country, and Subject Files proved to be of particular value.
                    The editor also made use of the White House tapes recordings, especially for the
                    high-level conversations concerning the formulation and implementation of the
                    New Economic Policy. The editor selected for publication short extracts of three
                    audiotapes of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>’s
                    discussions dealing with international monetary policy and identified other
                    relevant conversations in footnotes and editorial notes.</p>
                <p>The records of the Department of State were another important source. The
                    Department’s central files contain the cable traffic recording U.S. economic
                    relations with Japan and major West European countries; <pb n="XIII"
                        xml:id="pg_XIII" facs="0013"/>memoranda of diplomatic conversations; and
                    memoranda proposing action or providing information. Many important documents
                    are found only in the Department’s lot files. The conference files maintained by
                    the Executive Secretariat contain briefing materials as well as records of
                    conversations. Documentation on initiatives that were not approved is often
                    found only in desk or bureau files.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have access to records of the Department of
                    the Treasury at the Washington National Records Center, particularly the records
                    of the Secretaries of the Treasury, as well as Treasury Under Secretaries and
                    Assistant Secretaries.</p>
                <p>Almost all of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of the
                    agencies mentioned, the assistance of their staffs, and especially the
                    cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration. In
                    addition, John H. Taylor, Executive Director of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Richard Nixon</persName> Library and Birthplace Foundation, facilitated
                    access to relevant tape recordings of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> White House.</p>
                <p>The following list identifies the particular files and collections used in the
                    preparation of this volume. The declassification and transfer to the National
                    Archives of the Department of State records is in process, and many of these
                    records are already available for public review at the National Archives. The
                    declassification review of other records is going forward in accordance with the
                    provisions of Executive Orders 12958 and 13142, under which all records over 25
                    years old, except file series exemptions requested by agencies and approved by
                    the President, should be reviewed for declassification by 2003.</p>

                        <p>The present U.S. balance-of-payments position is very precarious. Serious
                            deterioration in the nation’s trade accounts is being temporarily
                            camouflaged by a combination of window-dressing special transactions and
                            an abnormal inflow of foreign capital.</p>
                        <p>Existing balance-of-payments controls should be rapidly eliminated
                            because they are wasteful and inefficient, undermine our free enterprise
                            system, and thus reduce the rate of growth in the economy. Their
                            dismantling is further indicated because whatever short-run payments
                            relief they may have afforded in the past, they are now beginning to
                            have a delayed adverse effect. Diplomatic efforts aimed at inducing
                            other countries to hold more dollars than they normally would also
                            should be terminated.</p>
                        <p>Given the present underlying weakness of our payments position, severe
                            foreign-exchange pressures against the dollar could develop quickly. A
                            series of protective actions is therefore necessary, involving the
                            pursuit of disinflationary economic policies domestically and
                            simultaneous reform of existing international monetary arrangements.</p>
                        <p>With respect to reform, confidential negotiations with the key industrial
                            countries through the Group of Ten should begin immediately, with the
                            main American objective being to secure quickly a significant
                            realignment of parities of some currencies. To provide continuing
                            flexibility in the international monetary mechanism, this one-time
                            realignment should be accompanied by: <list>

                        <p>Such reform in itself would not solve the problem of outstanding dollar

                            dollar into gold would continue. Nevertheless, a general increase in the
                            price of gold should not be undertaken because its benefits would be
                            distributed very unevenly and inequitably and because it would tend to
                            fuel international inflationary tendencies.</p>
                        <p>Continuation of de facto inconvertibility of the dollar into gold need
                            not be a crucial problem so long as visible progress is being made by
                            the United States in pursuing domestic policies that promise reduction
                            of new infusions of dollars into the international economy and so long
                            as flexibility is imparted to the international monetary mechanism.
                            Foreigners recognize that any large-scale attempt to convert dollars
                            into gold would disrupt international trade and payments and would lead
                            to an immediate American embargo on gold exports. If for any reason this
                            premise proves false and a “gold rush” develops, the United States
                            should suspend gold convertibility before our gold stock declines very
                            much below its present level. Such suspension would not necessarily lead
                            to a radical depreciation of the dollar on international exchanges.
                            Instead, it is likely that many countries would continue the policy of
                            pegging their currencies at the existing parities to the dollar. In a
                            period of transition during which convertibility was suspended,
                            negotiations aimed at introducing new flexibility into the international
                            monetary mechanism could proceed.</p>

                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration inherited
                            a macroeconomic international economic environment characterized by
                            declining U.S. merchandise trade and current account surpluses. The
                            trade surplus declined from $6.8 billion in 1964 to $0.6 billion in 1968
                            and the current account balance had declined from a $5.8 billion surplus
                            to, for the first time since 1959, a $0.5 billion deficit in 1968. The
                            trade surplus remained constant at $0.6 billion in 1969 while the
                            current account deficit mounted to just over $1.0 billion.</p>

                        <p>With postwar recovery, international capital flows had become an
                            increasingly important part of international transactions in the 1960s.
                            Many of these capital flows were associated with international direct
                            investment on the part of the multinational corporations, and this issue
                            came to a head in the 1970s under the rubric of economic nationalism in
                            developing countries and the quest in <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1"
                                >UNCTAD</gloss> and elsewhere for codes of conduct for multinational
                            corporations. Other capital flows were associated with the increasing
                            predilection of companies, financial institutions, and central
                            governments to have portfolio and currency positions in other than their
                            national currencies, in part related to the rise of the Euro-dollar
                            market and the role of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency. The U.S.
                            balance on current account and long-term capital was in deficit most
                            years from 1960, and increased from a $1.4 billion deficit in 1968 to a
                            $3.0 billion deficit in 1969. The net liquidity balance-of-payments
                            deficit increased from $1.6 billion in 1968 to $6.1 billion in 1969.
                            However, the official reserves transactions balance of payments recorded
                            a $1.6 billion surplus in 1968 and that surplus increased to $2.7
                            billion in 1969. U.S. monetary gold reserves had declined from $17.8
                            billion at the end of 1960 to $10.8 billion at the end of 1968, but then
                            increased to $11.9 billion by the end of 1969. (The Economic Report of
                            the President, 1973)</p>
                        <p>The perception of an increasingly precarious U.S. balance-of-payments
                            position led the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration to take a
                            number of measures to encourage exports, stem imports, and restrict
                            international capital flows. Regarding these measures, see <ref

                            question of whether or not to intensify these measures, roll them back,
                            or adopt a new approach. The aforementioned measures, which were
                            microeconomic in nature, were directed at single items that go into the
                            balance of payments rather than the overall bottom line; as such they
                            tended to be resisted by those who agreed the balance of payments needed
                            correction but who favored a more free market-oriented, macroeconomic
                            approach.</p>

                            reduce U.S. forces in Europe for balance-of-payments reasons. The
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> administration had already adopted a
                            policy for the Reduction of Costs in Europe (<gloss

                            agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany to compensate for the
                            balance-of-payments cost of maintaining a U.S. military presence in
                            Germany. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> soon
                            ordered a 10 percent reduction in official, non-military personnel

                            military burden-sharing with Europe and Japan became an important aspect
                            of the foreign policy dialogue. In Europe this was part of NATO strategy
                            and policy, but the underlying balance-of-payments problem was central
                            to the debate. An early input on this issue was given by Robert E.

                                    overcommitted and carrying an inequitable proportion of the
                                    collective defense burden in Europe. They have focused on the

                                    ‘substantial’ reductions and by the Symington Amendment, which

                            dollar-denominated assets was a major source of new international
                            liquidity in the 1960s, but was increasingly seen as a source of
                            instability in the international monetary system as foreign holdings of

                            actions to be taken in response to those consequences. It now appears
                            possible that Secretary Stans will announce a change in his part of the

                        <p>This question has a high foreign policy content. No action should be

                            controls. Removal of the controls might well result in a substantial
                            increase in the payments deficit, or at least widespread expectations
                            thereof, confronting the Administration with an international monetary
                            crisis. It would evoke a strong negative reaction from high officials in
                            Germany, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and possibly other
                            countries-a reaction that would, among many other things, undercut our
                            efforts to work out more satisfactory arrangements for sharing the
                            financial burden of NATO.</p>

                        <p>I understand that you have discussed with your domestic economic advisers

                            desirability of removing the controls. However, such a move has vitally
                            important foreign policy implications, especially with respect to our
                            relations with Europe.</p>
                        <p>Removal of the controls must be planned carefully and, to avoid risking
                            an international monetary crisis, probably must be coupled with new and
                            positive U.S. policy initiatives. I therefore urge you to defer any
                            final decision on this matter until you can review the foreign policy
                            aspects with the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, and to instruct

                            on the priority of this Administration, we must be careful not to
                            inhibit our conduct of this review by appearing to belittle the

                        <p>1969 balance-of-payments projections present a bleak picture. The
                            anticipated gain in the trade balance and the current account in general

                            capital inflow.</p>
                        <p>The trade projection assumes continuation of the 10% surtax and of
                            current monetary policy; a <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> growth
                            (current dollars) of 7.1% as compared with 9% last year; and less
                            pressure on productive capacity.</p>
                        <p>The projected growth of total imports from 1968 to 1969 is only 5.2% (at
                            mid-point of range). But, <hi rend="italic">excluding</hi> autos and
                            parts imports from Canada, exceptional food imports in 1968, and
                            strike-induced imports in 1968, the growth is projected at about 8%.</p>
                        <p>The export projection assumes an 8% increase in industrial production in
                            other advanced countries, compared with an 8.8% increase last year. The
                            projected growth of total exports from 1968 to 1969 is 9.3% (at
                            mid-point of range). But, <hi rend="italic">excluding</hi> autos and

                            it is 11.9%.</p>
                        <p>The capital projections assume no change in the <gloss target="#t_IET1"

                        <p>With regard to foreign government investment in special Treasury issues
                            and medium-term U.S. bank CD’s, it should be noted that $911 million of
                            the former mature in 1969 ($800 million held by Canada and $111 million
                            held by Switzerland). About $2.4 billion of long-term bank CD’s held by
                            various foreign governments mature in 1969. <hi rend="italic">Even if

                            has been made, the probability of a continued deficit of a worrisome

                            need to be commenced promptly. This might involve a relaxation—beginning

                            risks and the likelihood of an increased capital outflow. It might also
                            involve the need, for balance-of-payments protection, of a continued
                            tight money policy, even if there is some easing in domestic
                            inflationary pressures. A relaxation of controls would be a clear step
                            in the direction of removing them, without throwing caution to the

                            has three basic alternatives: (1) modification and relaxation of the

                                    <p>This is presently proposed as $300,000 for 1969, compared

                                        balance-of-payments cost of increasing the level to $500,000
                                        would amount to approximately $60 million and would relieve

                                        for approximately 200 companies. Should the level be

                                        cost (over the $300,000 level) would amount to $160-200

                                        investment method. This optional method would allow a firm

                                <item>There has been a great deal of discussion about the
                                    possibility of collapsing Schedules A, B and C into a single
                                    schedule. This would do a great deal to simplify the

                                    program, and would be widely acclaimed by the business world.
                                    Data for estimating the payments cost of such a move will not be
                                    available until March. However, we would guess that the cost
                                    would be substantial—say, $1 billion—for the following reason.

                        <p>Shifting to a voluntary program would depend upon the cooperation of a

                            companies and a sources-and-uses-of-funds forecast with respect to their
                            foreign affiliates would be needed to conceive a voluntary program
                            adequately. This material will be gathered, hopefully, by the end of
                            April; and a proposal could be in shape for announcement some weeks

                        <p>In case borrowing costs in the U.S. decline relative to Europe, would
                            companies be willing to maintain their existing outstanding indebtedness
                            in Europe rather than refinance it in the U.S.? Would they be willing to
                            do a large portion of new borrowing in Europe, rather than in the U.S.
                            for direct investment purposes? Would they insist on counting exports as
                            an offset to their direct investment outflows?</p>

                        <p>Abandoning controls would cost $2 billion or more—compared to what it was
                            in 1968—depending upon the extent to which companies would refinance in
                            the U.S. foreign debt created in prior years and where they would raise
                            funds for new direct investment.</p>

                        <p>The announced 1969 program left the bank program ceiling at essentially
                            103 percent and made no significant changes in the Program. The Fed
                            resisted the general preference to exempt medium-term export credits, as
                            did the OFDI, which would be greatly affected by such an exemption. It
                            was felt that no major change should be made before the new
                            Administration had had an opportunity to review the over-all U.S.
                            balance-of-payments program.</p>
                        <p>It was announced last December that the Fed would review the Program
                            early in 1969, and Governor Brimmer is now in the process of discussing
                            with banks and other financial institutions their experience under the
                            Program. The main considerations of the Program review are the reduction
                            of inequities among financial institutions covered by the Program, and
                            the methods that might be used to resolve any conflict between the need
                            to stem potential dollar outflows and the need to assure that funds
                            necessary to finance U.S. exports are available. In order to stimulate
                            consideration by the banks of various alternatives, he has mentioned the

                            balance of payments cost will vary depending on the extent to which
                            additional extensions of credit are expected to stimulate exports that

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss> has operated as nearly an

                            with loans to foreigners or purchases of foreign bonds.</p>
                        <p>Collection data show that well over half the <gloss target="#t_IET1"
                                >IET</gloss> payments in over four years were associated with
                            American purchases of South African gold mining shares. Most of the
                            balance came from purchases of outstanding issues of Canadian mining
                            stocks and a few “special situation” issues. U.S. speculators in foreign
                            mining shares have generally been able to resell “tax-paid” shares in
                            the U.S. market at prices equal to or exceeding what they paid the

                        <p>We cannot predict with any precision what rate constitutes the threshold
                            for substantial outflows based upon interest differentials alone. But an
                            example of the potential for such outflows is the large volume of
                            attractive convertible bonds issued abroad by U.S. companies in recent
                            years to finance direct investment. A substantial reduction of the
                                <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss> would seem very likely to
                            encourage U.S. private purchases of these issues and thus defeat the
                            purpose of the Foreign Direct Investment Program-that is, the
                            encouragement of use of foreign capital for financing U.S. direct
                            investment.</p>
                        <p>A reduction to one percent per year would not entail a substantial
                            increase in capital outflow under the existing structure of interest
                            rates here and abroad. A reduction to three fourths of 1 percent would
                            be more risky because a sizeable pent-up U.S. demand for foreign issues
                            probably exists, and a sizeable reduction of the <gloss target="#t_IET1"
                                >IET</gloss> could trigger it off, not only because of the reduced

                            liberalization step.</p>
                        <p>Also, interest differentials between here and Europe could shift by
                            mid-summer sufficiently to make a three fourths percent rate quite
                            costly and even a one percent rate costly.</p>

                                2/28-3/2/69. Secret. The meeting was held at the Elysee Palace; the

                                Files, President’s Daily Diary) The two Presidents also met on
                                February 28. Their discussion touched on economic issues, and
                                President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> told
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> that he thought
                                “it was clear that both the USSR and the US would like to reduce the
                                financial burden [of defense expenditures] on themselves. He wished
                                to make clear that on this matter he would not make the decision in
                                this matter on a financial basis, the US had to be able to afford
                                whatever security required.” (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                        <p>The President said that he would like to have an understanding with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> that if either
                            of them wished to communicate directly with the other they could do so
                            by private letters and such relations need not necessarily pass through
                            the usual diplomatic channels. For any private matters below the Chief
                            of State level, General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            could have his people communicate with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> asked whether
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> himself would bring
                            the letters.</p>
                        <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0045"/>
                        <p>The President said that this would not necessarily be so, but he might
                            find the need at some time to send Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> over. He said that sometimes it was useful to
                            avoid communications that were too formal in nature.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> agreed and said
                            he would bear this in mind.</p>
                        <p>The President said that, insofar as discussions on monetary matters were
                            concerned, he felt that the suggestion that these could be handled
                            privately and discreetly through a special representative was a good
                            one, and we would be prepared to talk with whoever the General might
                            designate to represent France on such matters.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said that after
                            the President returned to Washington he would let him know who the
                            French would appoint. This person, of course, would have an unofficial
                            mission and would not be charged with settling matters but rather to
                            take contact with his American counterpart.<note n="2" xml:id="d7fn2">No

                                surfaced. On February 5 <persName corresp="#p_HH1"

                                dinner conversation with the Financial Counselor of the French
                                Embassy, George Plescoff, of the latter’s “pitch” for bilateral
                                U.S.-French conversations “on the entire range of international
                                monetary problems.” (VG/LIM/69-12; Washington National Records

                                said he had not sought to have regular official contact with
                                Treasury in recent years due to policy differences but that he now
                                wished to develop a close and regular working relationship.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> thought conveying
                                this message was the main purpose of his call. (Ibid., Files of

                                to arrange some quiet, unpublicized talks on the problem of
                                international monetary reform.” (Ibid.) In an April 19 memorandum to

                                    >Kissinger</persName> reported: “<persName corresp="#p_DM4"
                                    >Debre</persName> raised the possibility of very confidential
                                US-French conversations, recalling that this idea had been broached
                                previously at the time of the President’s visit to Paris.”

                        </p>
                        <p>The President agreed to this.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> then asked
                            whether the President had made similar arrangements with the British and
                            the Germans.</p>
                        <p>The President said that this had not been done. We would talk with them
                            in a more formal way. Both the British and the German Finance Ministers
                            would be coming to the US, but he wondered whether the General felt it
                            might be better to handle these matters with them in the same way as the
                            French.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said that he did
                            not see any reason to do this.</p>
                        <p>The President then said that it was better if the conversations were
                            conducted somewhat discreetly as formal discussions gave rise to
                            speculation on the price of gold and so forth. The discussions would be
                            initially exploratory.</p>
                        <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0046"/>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> then repeated
                            that he would notify the President, after his return to Washington, who
                            the French representative would be and reiterated that this man would be
                            an unofficial representative.</p>
                        <p>The President said he felt that one could not make much progress when one
                            was working in a goldfish bowl. On other matters of consultation, our
                            Secretary of Commerce, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName>,
                            would soon be coming to Europe. His discussions would be strictly on
                            matters of trade and in a broad sense. He would not get into matters
                            such as the Common Market and who should belong to it. Rather he would
                            discuss such matters as trade and restrictive practices which we or
                            others might have. His policy would be not to have our Government play
                            as active a role as in the past in attempting to determine the shape and
                            form of Europe. We had ideas which we would submit, but we felt that
                            this was essentially a matter for Europeans.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said that there
                            was <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and it was normal for our
                            Ministers to speak of this agreement and its application.</p>

                            the discussion by giving a brief report on the foreign exchange markets
                            which indicated that the pressure on the French franc and the pound
                            sterling was modest and the atmosphere of last Thursday<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d8fn2">March 6.</note> no longer prevailed. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> referred to the proposed
                            Memorandum to the President<note n="3" xml:id="d8fn3">Reference is to a
                                draft memorandum to the President on “Relaxation of

                                under cover of a memorandum inviting them to the March 11 meeting to
                                discuss the draft. (Washington National Records Center, Department

                                March-April, 1969) An earlier version of the draft memorandum to the
                                President, dated March 3 with the subject line, “Reversing the Trend
                                Toward Restrictions by Beginning the Relaxation of Controls,” is

                                    15</ref> for the memorandum that was sent to the President on
                                April 1.</note> and indicated that the proposed relaxation could
                            cost in balance of payments terms an amount in the neighborhood of $1
                            billion, depending upon various developments. He reported that the
                            staffs of the various agencies expressed considerable caution at the
                            idea of moving ahead now to relax controls to the degree indicated. The
                            primary concern was about the probable negative reaction abroad to such
                            a relaxation. Foreigners would grumble that this relaxation will finance
                            takeovers by American companies; it would make more difficult the
                            activation of Special Drawing Rights, and it could impede the talks on
                            monetary reform. Finally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1"
                                >Volcker</persName> reported that the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> Managing Director Schweitzer suggested caution about
                            the idea of relaxing controls and said that the cost could be reduced by
                            not including the Federal Reserve Program in the relaxation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> closed with the
                            question: Should the Federal Reserve be part of the relaxation? And what
                            should be the timing of the announcement?</p>
                        <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0048"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> pointed out the
                            difficulty of the choice in view of the bad balance of payments numbers
                            which are projected. “If we do nothing now,” he said, “we get locked
                            into the ways of the past; on the other hand, we do not want to touch
                            off an adverse market reaction with possible side effects that are
                            unpredictable.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> indicated that he
                            was leaving for Europe on April 11, and he would not want to have the
                            relaxation announced a week before he would go—as he would have to spend
                            most of his time explaining the action. Second, he underscored the
                            importance of an early announcement by pointing out that presently,
                            regulations do not exist for the foreign direct investment program for
                            1969; and, to be fair to the corporations, they must come out shortly.
                            Finally, he indicated that most of the advantages to the Administration
                            would be attained through the OFDI relaxation, and therefore it is
                            possible that it could be done separately.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> indicated that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> during his trip
                            agreed to undertake consultations with the Europeans, and he indicated
                            that it would be appropriate to do that on this matter. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said that the Europeans would
                            be likely to say: “No.” Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> indicated that this is what consultation is all
                            about. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName>
                            commented that, in view of this, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1"
                                >Volcker</persName> should propose to consult in Europe on this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>Counsellor <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName> doubted that the
                            balance of payments deficit as projected would be increased to the
                            extent indicated. He added that consultations may occasion long delays
                            in the announcement if they are undertaken thoroughly. The Europeans are
                            concerned about the trade policies of the United States, and they do not
                            understand the details of the OFDI. What they are anxious to avoid is a
                            unilateral action in the trade area.</p>
                        <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MCPW1">McCracken</persName> commented that
                            there are different dimensions to foreign concern about the U.S. balance
                            of payments. One concern is they would argue that we are taking the
                            wraps off of our companies, permitting them to buy out European
                            corporations. And the second concern is that we get on top of our
                            inflationary problem. He supported the relaxation and pointed out it
                            carried a greater obligation to control inflation at home.</p>
                        <p>Counsellor <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName> said the fact the
                            domestic economy was going too fast and the fact that the relaxation
                            carried a greater obligation to control inflation provided all the more
                            reason to pursue the course of relaxation of controls now. If we can
                            announce our expenditure policy for fiscal 1970, the President’s
                            proposed balance of payments statement would be greatly
                            strengthened.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> doubted if more
                            pressure to control inflation were needed—there is no lack of
                            consciousness or determination in this regard. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> added that we are not getting
                            the budgetary cuts he would like to see.</p>
                        <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0049"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HH1">Houthakker</persName> suggested that the
                            relaxation could be presented as primarily a technical adjustment.
                            Counsellor Burns said the matter was broader than that, and the
                            announcement should be too: we should add the continued deferment of
                            withholding tax on interest paid on foreign deposits. We must decide now
                            whether we do or do not have a philosophy as a government; we must
                            declare we are moving away from creeping restrictionism. The Europeans
                            are as afraid as we are of the trend toward restrictionism.</p>
                        <p>While Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> did not feel
                            there is any need for a ballyhoo statement because American interests
                            would understand the significance of the move, Counsellor Burns felt
                            that the President needed to state his principles now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR1">Petty</persName> inquired if an
                            announcement of this sort was really of the nature that would require
                            consultations; it is nowhere near the league of NPTs or ABMs. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> replied that the
                            statements on the President’s trip did not imply any limits to
                            consultation.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_MRP1">Mayo</persName> indicated that any
                            announcement would be strongly reinforced with an announcement on
                            expenditure cuts and an extension of the tax surcharge.</p>
                        <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MWMCJ1">Martin</persName> summarized his
                            views and said that it would be appropriate to undertake consultations
                            on this subject, but he emphasized that these consultations should be at
                            the political level and not with the central banks or even with the
                                <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> Deputies. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> should make it clear that the
                            United States is choosing general restraint over selective controls and
                            we would take whatever steps necessary to control inflation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> summarized: Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> would go and make the
                            necessary consultations, he would present this action in a positive
                            manner and indicate that this Administration would seek an extension of
                            the Interest Equalization Tax, an extension of the surtax, and include
                            appropriate expenditure controls, as well.<note n="4" xml:id="d8fn4">

                                to that of the previous Administration, which enacted the entire

                            with great concern the growing trend toward restrictionism around the
                            world. Restraints on capital flows are now being reinforced by
                            restraints on the trade account and the pressure in this area is
                            mounting. We have not succeeded if a system <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24"

                            payments between nations are adjusted must be improved in order that
                            equilibrium relationships can be maintained without selective

                                            from the proceeds of their operations abroad; the

                                            might see it as a slight easing of demand upon their

                                    Congress gave us flexible authority to vary the rate with money
                                    conditions and since this is a unique delegation of authority we
                                    must use it when conditions warrant; otherwise, when we go to
                                    extend this legislation next year, Congress may withdraw that

                        <p>Increasingly, our main thrust in balance of payments adjustment will be
                            upon general measures rather than selective controls. There is no doubt

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss> expires on July 31 of this year.
                            In view of the necessity for Congressional consultations and the likely
                            extensive drafting time, we must plan now for the extension.</p>
                        <p>Congress has never been favorably disposed toward the <gloss
                                target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss> but rather has supported it because of
                            its necessity. The tax was proposed in 1963 and the Act only passed a
                            year later. The Act has been renewed twice, in 1965 for 18 months and in
                            1967 for two years. In the most recent extension, the maximum rate of
                            tax was increased (from one percent <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26"
                                facs="0054"/>to 1-1/2 percent per annum) and the President was given
                            discretionary authority to vary the rate of tax.</p>
                        <p>Our problems with the balance of payments are still with us and
                            undoubtedly will continue to be after July 31. Therefore, we will need
                            the <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss>, at very least on a standby
                            basis, as a means to restrain capital outflows from the United States.
                            The <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss> has been very useful in
                            effecting such restraint on portfolio outflows and bank lending to
                            foreign borrowers and has supplemented both the Federal Reserve and
                            Commerce Department programs. These are reasons enough to continue the
                            tax.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss> also will provide a very flexible
                            policy instrument in the future when it may be appropriate to relax our
                            monetary policy at least for domestic purposes. We would not want to be
                            constrained from taking this action in fear of substantial capital
                            outflows. Accordingly, extension of the <gloss target="#t_IET1"
                                >IET</gloss> will preserve our ability to carry out a relatively
                            autonomous monetary policy.</p>
                        <p>In the prospective phasing out of our capital controls, there is the
                            possibility that we may face large capital outflows by U.S. residents.
                            There is undoubtedly substantial latent demand to purchase foreign
                            securities or Euro-dollar convertible debentures issued by American
                            corporations in recent years as well as to lend to major foreign
                            borrowers. Therefore, to permit better phasing out of our capital
                            controls and to mitigate these incipient outflows, we should retain a
                            flexible <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Possible Legislation</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss> Act now on the books is a
                            workable and effective instrument. There are a number of technical
                            points, both substantive and non-substantive, which could be clarified
                            in renewal legislation. However, if such amendments were to jeopardize
                            the prospect of renewal, it would be entirely feasible to continue the
                                <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss> without amendment.</p>
                        <p>Renewal is strongly recommended for the reasons cited above. If
                            Congressional soundings indicate any substantial opposition or
                            complications from an attempt to introduce amendatory legislation, then
                            we should seek renewal without amendment.</p>
                        <p>The tax rate may now be varied from zero to 22.5 percent of the value of
                            the security or loan subject to tax (equivalent to a maximum interest
                            rate of 1-1/2 percent per annum). The President has the right to vary
                            the rate by Executive Order. The maximum rate has proved to be effective
                            in restraining almost all outflows for debt securities and loans and
                            most equity securities other than speculative mining stocks.
                            Accordingly, there is no reason to seek a higher statutory maximum rate
                            or any change in the discretionary authority to alter the rate.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss> rate now must move together for
                            the tax on acquisition of both stocks and debt instruments. In the past,
                            Treasury has always <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0055"/>rationalized
                            the <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss> rate in relation to debt issues.
                            There is very little economic basis for holding that the <gloss
                                target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss> rate should move together on both debt
                            and equity issues. It thus might be preferable to consider having the
                            tax move separately, at the discretion of the President, and possibly to
                            set a higher maximum rate of tax for the purchase of equity securities.
                            However, such a proposal would draw the opposition of the investment
                            community as it has in the past, present substantial drafting and
                            administrative problems and likely complicate renewal legislation.
                            Accordingly, it appears favorable not to introduce any amendment in this
                            area.</p>
                        <p>An amendment should be considered to give the President discretionary
                            authority to exempt new issues from the application of the tax while
                            retaining the tax on outstanding securities. We have such a precedent
                            established in the present exemption of new Canadian offerings from the
                            tax while the <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss> barrier still applies
                            for outstanding Canadian securities. The introduction of such
                            discretionary authority on a global basis among the developed countries
                            wherein the <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss> applies, would give a
                            new degree of flexibility for phasing out our capital controls. In
                            particular, this would give more latitude to permit a limited amount of
                            capital outflows for new financings in the U.S. markets without
                            incurring substantial risk of large portfolio capital outflows to
                            purchase outstanding foreign securities (particularly equities).</p>
                        <p>There are several other housekeeping and technical improvements that we
                            could make in this legislation. For the most part, the matters are
                            non-substantive, but they would close loopholes and improve
                            administration. There are a number of substantive matters which should
                            be handled by legislation (e.g., the <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss>
                            status of leases, oil and gas interests and other hybrid ownership
                            interests such as commodity futures; the treatment of captive foreign
                            sales finance companies; and the treatment of foreign stock or debt
                            obligations acquired out of foreign sourced borrowings). Among the
                            substantive matters, it appears that amendments relating to the
                            treatment of leases and captive foreign sales finance companies are the
                            most important. In these two areas we find the greatest number of
                            taxpayer questions and possible inequities in interpretations of the
                            present statute. The current law is awkward in delineating conditions to
                            grant partial exemption of individual countries from the application of
                            the <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss>. At present, countries can be
                            exempted only by classification as “less developed” or through the
                            finding by the President that exemption in whole or in part is required
                            in the interest of international monetary stability. Over the years we
                            have had numerous requests (e.g., Bahamas, Iran, Ireland, Spain) for
                            partial or total exemption from the <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss>.
                            In most cases the requests have been founded more on political grounds
                            than on any economic hardship. Any amendment to give the President
                            greater <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0056"/>discretion in granting
                            partial exemption from the <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss> to
                            particular countries would undoubtedly severely complicate renewal
                            legislation and bring a host of foreign governmental requests for
                            exemption. Accordingly, it is recommended that no amendment of this sort
                            be considered.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Eliminating restraints on private investment abroad has three foreign
                            policy aspects. The first is that the initial effect of easier monetary
                            conditions in the U.S. in the absence of controls would be an enlarged
                            payments deficit, to which most of the countries of continental Europe
                            would object strongly. Foreign disapproval would be expressed relatively
                            quickly, even before the emergence of a large deficit, since foreign
                            officials can look ahead. The move would be interpreted as a disavowal
                            of our earnest intentions to maintain a strong payments position.</p>
                        <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0058"/>
                        <p>Such officials, incidentally, do not share U.S. antipathy to controls
                            over capital movements. Nor does the foreign business community. Except
                            for Germany, all the European countries maintain some form of restraints
                            on international capital movements. Even Switzerland, the citadel of
                            free enterprise, controls the access of foreigners to the Swiss capital
                            market.</p>
                        <p>The main effect of this reaction would be a setback to our efforts to
                            improve the monetary system through cooperative steps with the
                            Europeans. Thinking that the U.S. no longer cares about its payments
                            position, their propensity to cooperate even in the activation of
                            Special Drawing Rights, let alone more far-reaching reforms such as
                            adoption (or even serious study) of greater exchange rate flexibility,
                            will be sharply reduced. In short, we may be circumscribing our option
                            of a cooperative solution—forcing us inevitably toward the kind of
                            unilateral action described below. (The counter-argument is that a
                            cooperative approach will not work anyway and that unilateral U.S. moves
                            are inevitable. I do not share this pessimism.)</p>
                        <p>Second, many—probably most—Europeans welcome U.S. controls on direct
                            investment (i.e., investment involving U.S. management control) as
                            providing some slowdown to the takeover of European industry by American
                            firms. This potentially explosive anxiety is by no means confined to
                            government officials. To be sure, Europeans are ambivalent about
                            American investment. Except for those firms feeling the direct
                            competition, they generally welcome the infusion of technology and even
                            new management techniques. But, because of the central position of the
                            U.S. dollar in the international monetary system, we are open to charges
                            of dollar imperialism if American capital is permitted to move to Europe
                            without restraint—at least as long as our balance of payments is in
                            sizable deficit. Some kind of restraint on direct investment-even the
                            pre-1968 voluntary restraints were helpful in this regard—provides the
                            necessary ambiguity on our side, combined with their own ambivalence, to
                            diffuse the issue.</p>
                        <p>Finally, and most important, the alternative policies which we might be
                            forced to adopt in lieu of capital controls could be much more damaging
                            to U.S. foreign policy. Troop withdrawals, additional pressure on
                            Germany and others for “better” offset arrangements, and further
                            restrictions on the aid program are only the most obvious
                            possibilities—and ones which we should reject for obvious foreign policy
                            reasons. Unilateral U.S. suspension of gold convertibility—essentially
                            adoption of a floating exchange rate of the dollar—would represent a
                            massive display of U.S. power and rupture all our efforts to forge a new
                            partnership with Europe on the basis of greater equality. An increase in
                            the official price of gold—which would represent only a temporary
                            solution anyway—would also be a unilateral act rejected by most official
                                <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0059"/>Europeans and would betray
                            $15 billion worth of dollar holders from Germany to Thailand. Adoption
                            of trade controls, such as export subsidies and import surcharges, would
                            be no economic improvement over capital controls and would be much more
                            damaging to our foreign policy, because of the network of international
                            rules which govern trade and which would be broken in the process.</p>
                        <p>As I understand it, the present proposal of the Secretary of Treasury is
                            for some relaxation in all three of the present control programs but
                            mainly affecting direct investment. The estimated gross cost to the
                            balance of payments is about $400 million. The relaxation would come
                            against an agreed projection of significant deterioration—at least $1
                            billion and possibly more—in our payments position in 1969. This first
                            step will raise the problems outlined above to only a minor extent, but
                            I recommend that you not commit yourself irrevocably to the abolition of
                            investment restraints until a clear alternative is in sight.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The German offset problem arises because of the effects on the U.S.
                            balance of payments of our military expenditures in Germany, which are
                            approaching $1 billion per year. The Administration must negotiate a
                            “good agreement” or risk: (a) heightened Congressional pressure for
                            troop withdrawals, and (b) an increased balance of payments deficit <pb
                                n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0060"/>which under the present
                            international monetary system can cause us serious economic and foreign
                            policy problems. Treasury, with Defense and State not far behind, wants
                            to meet these problems by requiring Germany to spend in the U.S. roughly
                            equivalent amounts of money, linked as closely as possible to military
                            items (purchases of U.S. military equipment, training of German military
                            personnel in the U.S., support costs for U.S. military expenditures in
                            Germany, etc.).</p>
                        <p>The real issue is what constitutes a “good agreement” and to what end we
                            should use the leverage with the Germans provided by our military
                            position. The German Cabinet has decided to offer a package, for two
                            years, which will offset about 75 percent (about $700 million annually)
                            of our expenditures. It would include $350 million of military
                            procurement, about $70 million of non-military procurement, and about
                            $300 million of loans of various types. It is probable that most of the
                            non-military procurement and some of the loans would occur independent
                            of the offset arrangement, i.e. the U.S. would get no additional balance
                            of payments benefits from them. Some of the military procurement would
                            occur anyway too, but military purchases are conventionally accepted as
                            true offsets and hence meet our domestic political problem.</p>

                        <p>The previous Administration adopted a progressively tougher line with
                            Germany on the offset. U.S. troop levels in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> were linked explicitly to German commitments to fully
                            offset the resultant costs to our balance of payments. Accepted methods
                            for achieving the offset evolved: <list>
                                <item>—From military purchases which Germany would have made anyway,
                                    and which thus provided no additional real help for our balance
                                    of payments.</item>
                                <item>—Through purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds which caused the
                                    Germans some pain, though not much because of the huge payments
                                    surpluses they were running, and which helped our balance of
                                    payments statistically but were criticized by many as only
                                    “postponing the problem”.</item>
                                <item>—To commencement of efforts to get Germany to pick up a large
                                    part (perhaps $400 million annually) of our own expenditures in
                                    the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, which would clearly
                                    help our balance of payments but are seen by the Germans as
                                    politically indefensible support costs reminiscent of the
                                    occupation.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition, in 1967 Germany fully committed itself not to buy gold from
                            the United States. This has no impact on our balance of payments
                            statistics, but is by far the most important part of the “offset”
                            package. It means that Germany, despite its huge and persistent payments
                            surpluses, will put no pressure on U.S. reserves and thus reduces
                            sharply the constraints generated by our payments deficits. There is no
                            evidence of serious German unhappiness with this part of the
                            package.</p>

                        <p>Our offset talks with Germany have proceeded largely independent of our
                            over-all international monetary policy. In the latter context, we have
                            pressured the Germans to eliminate their surpluses—most recently at the
                            crisis conference in November when we took the unprecedented step of
                            explicitly urging them to upvalue their currency.<note n="2"

                        <p>Germany is unlikely to accept “real” offsets to our military expenditures
                            unless we commit ourselves to a fixed level of forces in Germany for
                            several years and/or the President makes it his top priority
                            requirement. If he were to do so, the credibility of our security
                            commitment and political relations with Germany would suffer
                            enormously.</p>
                        <p>Further loans would neither allay our domestic pressures for the longer
                            run nor really get us very much help on the monetary front.</p>
                        <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0063"/>
                        <p>Complete abandonment of the issue gives away a major U.S. bargaining
                            lever and risks major financial difficulty. We should thus change our
                            offset policy to (a) reduce the political and security problems caused
                            by demands for support costs and (b) to pursue positively our major
                            international monetary objectives. These objectives are (a) assurance of
                            sufficient international liquidity via Special Drawing Rights; (b)
                            improvements in the adjustment process, probably including greater
                            flexibility of exchange rates; and (c) restoration of stability in the
                            exchange markets which will require an upvaluation of the DM. Active
                            cooperation by Germany on each of these issues—on upvaluation after
                            their election in October—is a necessary component of a satisfactory
                            approach. It will be difficult to move the bureaucracy quickly in this
                            direction but the potential gains in both political and economic terms
                            are well worth it.</p>
                        <p>Because it will take up to a year to monitor German performance and to
                            educate the American public on this approach, we should inform Germany
                            at once of these changes in our position for the future, but accept
                            their package for this year as a transitional device. (If they want to
                            soften their package as a result, we should be willing to consider so
                            doing.)</p>

                                    improvement, particularly in trade accounts. Impression left was
                                    that we will be reminded of “premature” easing during future
                                    bargaining on monetary reform if overall balance of payments

                                    signify long-term objective to minimize reliance on controls,
                                    (2) “limited” and “prudent” nature of move, (3) decision to
                                    retain basic control apparatus for time being and to request
                                    renewal of <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss> authority, and
                                    (4) possible value of affirming in this way commitment to
                                    liberal trade and payments at a time when protectionist
                                    pressures are rising world wide.</item>

                                <item>My conclusion is that we should go ahead on agreed basis
                                    against background of strongest possible stance re monetary and
                                    fiscal restraint. Announcement should be related to surtax
                                    announcement and presidential endorsement of spending restraint.
                                    Timing and nature of future moves should be left vague. It seems
                                    to me essential that President request renewal of <gloss
                                        target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss> authority to avoid any
                                    impression of “recklessness” or implication that controls will
                                    be entirely dismantled at an early date. Statement should
                                    clearly recognize that U.S. accepts, as corollary of relaxation
                                    of controls, additional burden on monetary and fiscal policies
                                    as basic tools for dealing with balance of payments.</item>
                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>Alternative approach would be to forego inclusion of Federal
                                    Reserve program in package at this time. This would certainly
                                    ease European concerns over possible balance of payments impact.
                                    However, I do not feel this compromise approach essential in
                                    light of reactions received. European attitudes do confirm,
                                    however, that proposed actions, while useful, do carry some risk
                                    of weakening our bargaining position.</item>

                        <p>It is important that this Administration signal at an early date and in a
                            concrete way its intention to reverse the trend toward controls and
                            restrictions on international payments. To that end, we propose a
                            limited but significant relaxation of the present controls on capital
                            movements. This recommendation is being made following a series of
                            consultations just undertaken in Western Europe by my Under Secretary
                            for Monetary Affairs, <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Paul
                                Volcker</persName>. The reactions he received ranged from
                            unenthusiastic to cautionary.<note n="2" xml:id="d15fn2">See <ref

                            pointed out that these proposed steps will not make things any easier on
                            an early and sizeable activation of the Special Drawing Rights. This
                            reaction was anticipated, and emphasizes the necessity in European eyes
                            for accompanying relaxation of controls with evidence of restrictive
                            monetary and fiscal policies. European reservations are not, however, a
                            compelling reason for delay.</p>

                        <p>In making this recommendation, we are running a risk in terms both of
                            weakening our balance-of-payments position this year and of adverse
                            reactions abroad. In particular, we are proposing this relaxation in
                            face of staff projections of a substantial balance-of-payments deficit
                            in 1969 on the liquidity basis and the absence of evidence that the
                            deterioration in our trade accounts has yet been reversed. In fact, a
                            February trade deficit has just been announced.</p>
                        <p>The more widely used definition of our balance of payments, the so-called
                            liquidity measure, showed a small surplus of $158 million in 1968.
                            However, this surplus was achieved only by virtue of an unprecedented
                            inflow of private capital stimulated by controls, tight money, and the
                            attraction of our stock market. In addition, there was an element of
                            “statistical window-dressing” (mainly foreign governments’ buying <pb
                                n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0066"/>medium-term securities at our
                            behest rather than investing in short-term Treasury bills and time
                            deposits). The less familiar official settlements measure (not
                            ordinarily affected by our “window-dressing”) showed a substantial
                            surplus of $1,600 million.</p>
                        <p>The first quarter of 1969 will show a very large deficit on the familiar
                            liquidity basis. The official settlements measure, on the other hand,
                            will show a surplus—still reflecting our tight monetary policy.</p>
                        <p>Attachment A<note n="3" xml:id="d15fn3">Not printed. Attachment A gives
                                the balance-of-payments result for 1968 and the projection for 1969.
                                The projection for the liquidity deficit in 1969 was $3 billion
                                compared to an actual deficit of $1.1 billion in 1968.</note> tells
                            the story for 1968, and shows the 1969 forecast of a further deficit of
                            around $3 billion on the liquidity measure. The official settlements
                            outcome is more difficult to forecast but it is not likely to be so bad.
                            While balance-of-payments forecasts have particularly wide margins of
                            error, there is good reason to believe that deterioration in the capital
                            accounts will more than offset an anticipated gradual increase in the
                            trade surplus later this year.</p>
                        <p>These projections make no allowance for the relaxations we are proposing.
                            Potentially, these relaxations could add almost $1 billion to the
                            deficit. However, we would expect the net cost to be considerably
                            less—perhaps no more than $500 to $600 million—if money remains tight in
                            the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Aggravation of the already difficult balance-of-payments problem carries
                            important economic and political risks. The result could be to intensify
                            pressures for maintenance of restrictive monetary policies to protect
                            the balance of payments, even if that would be less appropriate than at
                            present in terms of the domestic economy.</p>
                        <p>A further danger is psychological. Some financial officials abroad view
                            the action as premature, and may reduce their willingness to cooperate
                            with the U.S. in other areas. In particular, it will make more difficult
                            our objective of obtaining an early activation, in appropriate size, of
                                <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>’s. Moreover, we must guard
                            against any lessening of the sense of urgency in the U.S. about dealing
                            with the balance-of-payments problem, including efforts to economize on
                            net government spending abroad.</p>
                        <p>On balance, we think these risks are acceptable. The main advantage is to
                            indicate, early in your Administration, a firm intent to reject
                            “creeping restrictionism” as an answer to our problems; also to
                            demonstrate that the philosophy of achieving solutions consistent with
                            market forces should carry over into the trade area.</p>
                        <p>The potential losses entailed, while significant, may not themselves be
                            the critical margin in the viability of the present monetary <pb n="39"
                                xml:id="pg_39" facs="0067"/>system. Properly presented, the moves
                            proposed should suggest confidence and prudence, rather than a
                            willingness to throw caution to the winds.</p>
                        <p>To maximize the benefits with minimal risk, it is essential that this
                            relaxation be accompanied by an expression of your broad
                            balance-of-payments strategy and objectives. Therefore, we propose an
                            announcement along the lines of Attachment B.<note n="4" xml:id="d15fn4"
                                >Not found. Attached is the actual statement as released on April 4;

                                that the April 4 text was drafted in the White House “using
                                Treasury’s draft.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>This announcement would express your determination to create over time a
                            viable balance-of-payments picture without a mass of controls, reversing
                            the restrictionist trend of the past. But it would also highlight the
                            actions you are taking to strengthen our economy and the dollar, to
                            develop an effective export program, and to work toward monetary
                            reforms.</p>
                        <p>The question of whether this action now implies that a second
                            installment, and maybe a third installment, is due at a predictable time
                            in the future is one upon which we believe judgment should be reserved.
                            Developments in our domestic economy later on this year, for example,
                            may raise a serious risk of a substantial capital outflow if our
                            Interest Equalization Tax is down too low. We would contemplate that the
                            Interest Equalization Tax could be utilized in a flexible manner in the
                            future. However, any relaxation in the Commerce or Federal Reserve
                            programs should be considered as a decision that would be very difficult
                            to reverse in the future.</p>

                        <p>It is important to note that OFDI’s chance of not exceeding the $3.35
                            billion ceiling rests on the companies’ carrying forward about $2
                            billion of unused investment quotas from 1969 to 1970. There is a good
                            chance of this happening only if present tight U.S. monetary policy is
                            continued.</p>
                        <p>Some thought has been given to raising the ceiling $600 million, rather
                            than $400 million. This would be done by raising the alternative base
                            percentage from 20 to 35 percent. However, this would only benefit about
                            25 additional companies, and $200 million seems to be too expensive for
                            such a small return.</p>
                        <p>Beyond this immediate announcement, we are studying additional ways to
                            simplify the Commerce program.</p>

                        <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MWMCJ1">Martin</persName> advises that the
                            Board of Governors recommends that the Federal Reserve guidelines for
                            restraints on credits to foreigners be modified to reduce the inequities
                            in the position of many of the smaller banks and to give some additional
                            room for export financing. First, the Board would increase the ceiling
                            for bank lending to foreigners by about $400 million. The room for
                            expanding such lending would actually be about double that amount since
                            banks are presently about a half billion dollars below the aggregate
                            ceilings. Virtually all of the increase would be available to the small
                            banks. Second, the Board would also lift the limit on loans by non-bank
                            financial institutions, such as insurance companies, by about $40
                            million. Banks and non-bank financial institutions would be asked to
                            continue to give top priority to credits to finance U.S. exports.</p>
                        <p>The Board believes the proposed increase in lending limits takes account
                            of the Commerce direct investment controls, to which the credit
                            restraints are closely related, and would, in fact, lead to no more than
                            a modest outflow of bank credits this year, under prevailing monetary
                            conditions.</p>

                            without risk of a substantial outflow. A smaller reduction would carry
                            the risk of being termed “tokenism.” A larger cut would run counter to
                            the philosophy of gradualism, which must be employed in phasing out
                            these controls, and would sharply increase the risk of an accelerated

                            this occurred, the <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss> rate would need
                            to be raised again quickly, and this would reflect on our judgment in

                                >Kennedy</persName> recommends that the President announce shortly
                            the modest relaxation of all three aspects of our controls over private
                            capital outflows already decided.<note n="2" xml:id="d16fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d15">Document 15</ref>.</note> The recommendation is
                            agreed to by Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName>, Chairman <persName

                                >Paul McCracken</persName>, and Bob Mayo.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you support the recommendation, although it carries
                            significant foreign policy (and domestic economic) risks as outlined in
                            the memo itself and conveyed to you in my earlier memos. There are,
                            however, two specific problems of concern to us, one relating
                            specifically to our new emphasis on consultations and one relating to
                            the decision-making process.</p>
                        <p>This recommendation was delayed for two weeks to permit Treasury Under
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> to consult with
                            the Europeans on it.<note n="3" xml:id="d16fn3">See <ref target="#d14"
                                    >Document 14</ref>.</note> None of the Europeans oppose the move
                            outright, but virtually all of them were highly cautionary. They
                            indicated that any resultant increase in the U.S. payments deficit would
                            weaken our over-all bargaining position, particularly with regard to
                            early and sizeable activation of Special Drawing Rights. The major
                            implication of this conclusion is that our preferred multilateral
                            approach to monetary reform is now less likely to succeed, and we may be
                            forced to take unilateral steps which could be seriously disruptive to
                            the entire Atlantic Alliance.</p>
                        <p>Since we do not plan to reduce the pressure on the Europeans to move
                            ahead on <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s—and on much more “radical”
                            reforms—the question of our sincerity in undertaking consultations will
                            arise at some point in the near future. We gave them a chance to record
                            their views and they did so. Our future action may well imply that we
                            have ignored those views. I flag this as an early case of the obvious
                            problem that the new emphasis on consultation will create. <pb n="43"
                                xml:id="pg_43" facs="0071"/>On decision making, this is a prototype
                            case of unsatisfactory ad hoccery. The President is being asked to
                            enunciate his over-all international monetary policy without ever
                            considering that policy. He has been given no choices, nor even a paper
                            on the over-all subject. In retrospect, the decision to lift the subject
                            from the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> agenda was a mistake<note

                        <p>This factor does not lead me to recommend your opposing the proposed
                            action, since the President has made known his strong desire to begin
                            relaxing the controls as soon as possible. But I suggest that you remind
                            the President that he is being asked to do something without
                            consideration of its context and without systematic exploration of its
                            full implications, and recommend that he instruct the Secretary of
                            Treasury to present an options paper for his consideration in the near

                        <p>Your meeting with Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT1">Fukuda</persName>
                            should take place against the background of increasing dissatisfaction
                            with the current status of the U.S.-Japanese partnership arrangement.
                            Japan is demanding the reversion of Okinawa and we in Treasury at least
                            are becoming increasingly concerned with the trade and financial
                            relationships. We had a bilateral balance of payments deficit with Japan
                            last year of more than a billion dollars—including $1.1 billion on
                            trade. The best forecasts that our people can produce show this trade
                            deficit likely to rise to a range of $3 to $3-1/2 billion within five
                            years. Our gross military expenditures in Japan are approaching $600
                            million and the Japanese spent less than $100 million here. I do not
                            think the American people will tolerate the development of a trade
                            deficit such as now appears to be in the cards nor do I see how the U.S.
                            can approach balance of payments equilibrium with such a deficit with
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> mechanism is currently
                            considering U.S. policy toward Japan. We in Treasury have not been
                            satisfied with the paper which is <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0073"

                            cooperation arrangements in 1968 which were negotiated by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJR1">Petty</persName> under the direction of a
                            Treasury-State-Defense steering group. These negotiations produced a
                            package with a nominal value approaching $500 million although much of
                            it was little more than window dressing. (See Tab B also.)</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_FT1">Fukuda</persName> will probably not
                            initiate any discussions on this subject but he will be alert to clues
                            as to your attitude toward offset agreements.</p>
                        <p>Japan’s great economic and financial strength is new and the Japanese
                            themselves are not yet accustomed to it. They consistently underestimate
                            their strength. They may even express some worries about their balance
                            of payments position this year, arguing that the expected slowdown in
                            the U.S. will cause a very drastic reduction in their exports. The
                            thinking of Japanese leaders still tends to be very parochial and
                            self-centered. Their concern is with appeasing their political
                            opposition in Japan and neither the government itself nor the Japanese
                            Diet has an adequate appreciation for the influence of economic
                            developments in Japan on the rest of the world. They want to be treated
                            by the U.S. as an equal partner but also to continue to receive the
                            special benefits that a guardian might bestow upon his ward. Anything
                            which appears on the horizon as a possible threat to the Japanese
                            commercial or financial position is likely to bring a highly emotional
                            reaction. Consequently, it is difficult to get the Japanese to assume
                            responsibilities and costs commensurate with their current and
                            prospective economic strength.</p>

                                ON JAPAN</p>
                            <p>The Treasury believes that this paper does not give adequate
                                attention to the relative sharing of costs and benefits of the
                                U.S.-Japanese partnership and incorrectly assesses the trends as
                                “increasingly valuable” to the United States. It is the Treasury
                                view that Japan is not carrying an equitable share of the financial
                                burden of the partnership, either budgetary or balance of payments.
                                Furthermore, the inequity appears to be growing rather than
                                diminishing. Unless we are able to reverse this trend and
                                demonstrate that Japan is moving promptly and steadily to assume a

                                Congressional and public pressures for trade restrictions and the
                                growth of anti-Japanese sentiment within the United States. The

                                question may be crucial to the continuation of the present

                                We believe that the United States should not underestimate what
                                Japan is willing to pay for the reversion of Okinawa. We believe,
                                furthermore, that U.S. balance of payments and trade goals should be
                                given a high priority in the quid pro quos we should seek for
                                concessions on Okinawa.</p>
                            <p>The Treasury feels that <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss>-5 does
                                not focus sharply enough on the question of priorities among U.S.
                                goals and that to the extent that it does touch on this question
                                insufficient weight is given to the need for large-scale
                                contributions by Japan toward equilibrium in the U.S. balance of
                                payments. Loss of world confidence in the dollar would be a
                                disastrous blow to the security of the free world as well as to the
                                world’s economic health and progress and the prestige of the United
                                States. Preservation of confidence in the dollar requiring the
                                elimination of our balance of payments deficit should be considered
                                in that context, along with the level of forces in Japan or nuclear
                                storage rights in Okinawa or Japanese aid for other countries in
                                Asia. <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0076"/>Throughout the paper
                                there is a tendency to assume that the balance of payments problems
                                will be solved “in a global context” making it unnecessary to look
                                to bilateral actions by Japan as a major contribution to this
                                problem. While the Treasury agrees that a multilateral agreement of
                                some type may be necessary before the U.S. restores a sustainable
                                payments equilibrium, we remain convinced that Japan, along with
                                Germany and other major surplus countries, must bear a very
                                substantial part of the required payments adjustment and that
                                bilateral actions, particularly involving the military accounts,
                                will be necessary.</p>
                            <p>For two years the U.S. has had overall bilateral payments deficits
                                with Japan of almost $1 billion annually. With no other country have
                                we had deficits which even approach this magnitude. The major
                                deficit elements are our military expenditures, now approaching $600
                                million annually, and a trade deficit which reached $1.1 billion in
                                1968. Our latest projections indicate that unless special action is
                                taken, our trade deficit with Japan may climb to $3 billion or more
                                in five years. We cannot tolerate such a development-either
                                politically or in terms of maintaining dollar confidence. We cannot
                                rely on the “hope” (as this document recommends) that the Japanese
                                will assume their fair share of the costs, but should make clear to
                                them at the highest level that a major redistribution is necessary
                                if the partnership is to remain viable. We should, furthermore,
                                assign high priority to this objective in our negotiations with
                                Japan on specific issues.</p>

                        <p>Later this week (probably on Thursday),<note n="2" xml:id="d21fn2">May
                                15.</note> the regular announcement will be made of the balance of
                            payments results for the first quarter. This will not be happy
                            reading.</p>
                        <p>The measure most widely used by the press—the so-called “liquidity”
                            balance—will be in deficit, seasonally adjusted, by $1.8 billion, or an
                            annual rate of $7.2 billion. While the informed public and foreign
                            officials are already aware that we had a sizeable deficit on this
                            basis, the actual near-record figure will nonetheless be startling. It
                            can only add to the already uncertain atmosphere in international
                            financial markets.</p>
                        <p>Actually, the immediate situation is not nearly so bad as the “liquidity
                            deficit” makes it look; moreover, the alternate measure of results
                            (“official settlements”) shows a very substantial surplus of $1.1
                            billion for the first quarter. This surplus reflects the strong
                            performance of the <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0081"/>dollar in the
                            exchange markets and the fact that official dollar holdings of many
                            European central banks got uncomfortably low-even before the recent
                            exchange crisis.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the liquidity deficit will make the headlines. The heavy
                            dependence of the official settlements surplus upon short-term capital
                            inflows related to the tight money conditions in the United States
                            renders this performance more suspect.</p>
                        <p>Only technicians will fully unravel the confusions inherent in the
                            different measures of our balance of payments. However, all
                            sophisticated observers will recognize that the structure of our balance
                            of payments is in poor shape. The major culprit is the long period of
                            domestic inflation and excess demand, which has dwindled away our
                            historic large trade surplus-averaging $4 to $6 billion in the first
                            half of the 1960’s—to a small deficit. Consequently, earnings on the
                            trade account are simply not available to pay for the balance of
                            payments costs of our aid and military commitments overseas, or for
                            private foreign investment.</p>
                        <p>For the time being, the adverse impact of the shrinking trade balance has
                            been largely offset by extraordinary capital inflows—long and short
                            term. But we must recognize that certain capital inflows are quite
                            subject to reflow. In looking ahead, we should be under no illusions
                            about our ability to achieve and maintain a sustainable payments
                            position without a sizeable positive trade balance.</p>

                                of funds abroad, either directly or through their foreign
                                subsidiaries. This reversed the artificial pull-back of funds to the
                                United States last December, when companies made sure they got under

                            <item>—In addition, the first quarter was almost free of so-called
                                “special” official transactions, which also contributed heavily to
                                the statistical liquidity surplus recorded in the fourth quarter of
                                1968. As a matter of policy, we have not pressed foreign countries
                                to alter the form of their dollar holdings simply to “dress up” our

                        <p>For these reasons, it is logical to average the last two quarters to
                            arrive at a fairer estimate of the trend in the payments, as shown in
                            the table attached.<note n="3" xml:id="d21fn3">Not printed. This short
                                table gave balance-of-payments results for 6-month periods ending in

                            While the six-month average shows a sizeable deficit on the liquidity
                            basis, it does not show a basic deterioration. Moreover, the official
                                <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0082"/>settlements basis shows an
                            improving trend—a fact that deserves more emphasis, even though we
                            cannot forget it is highly subject to variation.</p>

                        <p>A new Government staff review of the balance of payments outlook for this
                            year points to a near-record deficit of about $4 billion on the
                            liquidity basis, before allowing for any “Special Transactions”.
                            Estimates on the official settlements basis might show approximate
                            balance for the year as a whole but it could also give way to a sizeable
                            deficit. While these projections point up the structural weaknesses in
                            our balance of payments, our position could well be sustainable for some

                        <p>The potentially unsettling consequences on the international exchange
                            markets of our own balance of payments performance is further
                            complicated by the release this week of poor trade figures by both the
                            U.K. and France. The other side of the coin is the very strong
                            performance by Germany, Japan, and Italy. (It is not entirely a
                            coincidence that these countries carry relatively light defense
                            burdens.) The refusal of the Germans to revalue in the face of the
                            strongest kinds of market pressures—and the refusal of the Italians or
                            Japanese to even consider revaluation—only points up the difficulty of
                            redressing these basic imbalances in an orderly way.</p>

                        <p>However, we must also recognize that the events of recent weeks and our

                            economic roadblocks to orderly agreed change. We can anticipate the
                            probability of further currency crises. Conceivably, such a crisis could
                            be turned to a constructive purpose, and help accelerate the process of
                            desired change. But a crisis atmosphere could also defeat the process of
                            orderly change and cooperation by giving rise to uncoordinated,
                            independent actions detrimental to our basic objectives in this

                            examined by it, taking into account our desire not to undercut our
                            efforts to get our Allies to increase their defense efforts and our
                            desire not to reduce our combat capability.</p>
                        <p>The Committee concentrated on those items on which no agreement to
                            proceed had been reached previously, as well as those items where
                            agreement in principle existed but proceeding was dependent upon
                            discussion with host countries (i.e., Turkey and Spain).</p>
                        <p>In addition, the Committee reaffirmed those <gloss target="#t_REDCOSTE1"
                                >REDCOSTE</gloss> proposals previously agreed and approved the
                            proposed implementing schedule.</p>
                        <p>On those proposals upon which inter-agency agreement was pending, the
                            Committee agreed that we should proceed with some degree or form of
                            implementation of all but one of the proposals examined. However,
                            implementation of several of the proposals is conditional and subject to
                            responses and reactions of our European Allies.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of our tentative conclusions, it is anticipated that those
                                <gloss target="#t_REDCOSTE1">REDCOSTE</gloss> proposals previously
                            agreed, together with those recommended herein for approval, should
                            permit a possible reduction of about 27,400 military, 1,800 US
                            civilians, and 7,100 Foreign National personnel. It is expected that
                            there will be annual budget savings (after <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1972) of about $355 million and a saving of $128 million
                            in the balance of payments.</p>
                        <p>However, these figures are dependent upon Allied agreement to take over
                            certain tactical missions, (Hawk and Nike Battalions in <pb n="57"
                                xml:id="pg_57" facs="0085"/>Germany and Sergeant Missiles in Italy)
                            as well as Turkish assumption of certain facilities. If agreement is not
                            obtained, the above figures will be reduced by about one-third.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, if fully implemented, we could achieve about 80% of the
                            estimated 45,000 personnel reductions (32,000 military) and $429 million
                            and $158 million savings in budget and balance of payments which the
                            Secretary of Defense originally hoped to achieve. To have fully realized
                            these projected savings would have meant a highly visible reduction of
                            our forces in Europe, withdrawal of some NATO committed units (beyond
                            those being offered to our Allies), and some degradation of combat
                            capability, which might have been taken as a signal by our Allies of a
                            lessened US interest in NATO.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the effect on the combat capability of US forces, it is
                            our view that the cumulative impact of the <gloss target="#t_REDCOSTE1"
                                >REDCOSTE</gloss> adjustments which the Committee agreed to make
                            will not be significant. It is, of course, obvious that any reduction of
                            this magnitude will have some impact upon military operations. However,
                            the reductions have been effected essentially in the non-combat areas
                            and every attempt will be made to minimize the impact upon combat
                            capability. In this regard, General Goodpaster has been briefed, for his
                            cognizance when he becomes <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>, on
                            our conclusions and the magnitude and nature of the <gloss
                                target="#t_REDCOSTE1">REDCOSTE</gloss> proposals as well as the
                            manner in which we propose to handle implementation with our NATO
                            Allies.</p>
                        <p>In our scenario at Tab A<note n="3" xml:id="d22fn3">Entitled “Scenario
                                for Implementation”; not printed.</note> it will be noted that we
                            intend to handle each measure as an individual and independent action.
                            Consistent with this approach, we have agreed that the Government will
                            not make an announcement, as has been the practice in the past,
                            concerning the totality of the reduction to be made. In consonance with
                            the guidance in <gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss>-12 that the
                            proposals not be handled as a package, we do not intend to make public
                            nor inform our Allies about the total personnel to be eliminated or the
                            total savings anticipated. However, we would tell NATO, at the Military
                            Committee level, and the respective host countries concerned, about
                            certain significant measures. Our approach would be in terms of the
                            kinds of things we are doing to streamline and tighten up our military
                            establishment in Europe, rather than in terms of the quantitative
                            savings or reductions we expect to achieve.</p>

                                >Sato</persName>’s November 19-21 visit to Washington. U.S.
                            policymakers were determined to keep economic issues on the agenda, but

                        <p>On April 26 the Embassy in Tokyo transmitted the text of a paper that

                            April 28. On the economic issues Togo’s paper stated: “The current duty
                            of the Japanese government is to … aim at a rational approach to
                            bilateral economic issues … and in keeping with the increase in Japan’s

                            [Japan’s]role should be to progressively assume international political

                            Tokyo on May 22 reported that <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                                >Aichi</persName> would be prepared to discuss economic aid and
                            bilateral economic problems in the context of Togo’s paper, which had no
                            formal status but was an authoritative reflection of Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>’s views. The Embassy
                            further noted that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Aichi</persName> and
                            others were of the view that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SMH3"

                            agreed Japan should move ahead faster on liberalization but would have
                            great difficulty in appearing to move away from liberalization with
                            regard to textiles. Charge Osborn reported that he told the Japanese
                            officials that “Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName>
                            had not given us in the Embassy any impression of being anything but
                            extremely earnest on textiles and quite serious in warning that
                            alternative might be unilateral restrictive action.” (Telegram 4060 from

                                >Aichi</persName> would say “that Japan intends to assume greater

                                >Kissinger</persName> argued somewhat differently: “On the merits,
                            the Germans should make every concession we ask. After their failure to
                            revalue or take any alternative measures, they should do everything
                            possible to offset their huge balance of payment surplus.” Crossed out
                            language in the conclusion reads: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The merits are all on our side. And I told the Germans that you
                                    would take into account on the offset their overall monetary
                                    performance, which has been completely unforthcoming on
                                    revaluation or any alternatives. The Under Secretaries’
                                    Committee does not think that including the broader monetary
                                    issues in the offset talks would be fruitful at this time. There
                                    are major international monetary decisions to be made in the
                                    next few months, however, and the offset is one of our few
                                    levers with Germany. I therefore think we should leave the door
                                    open for awhile.”</p>

                        <p>The President has ordered a ten per cent reduction in all American
                            overseas civilians directly hired by the U.S. Government and certain
                            American military personnel overseas. Each agency with personnel
                            overseas will be required to meet the ten per cent quota, and reductions
                            will be made on a country-by-country basis, insofar as practicable. The
                            reduction should take account of national security priorities and
                            special local problems, without prejudice to the objective of ten per
                            cent for each agency. Attention should be given to the political
                            problems raised by cuts in U.S. personnel in Thailand. Civilian
                            personnel in South Vietnam will be cut by more than ten per cent.<note

                        </p>
                        <p>The President has directed the Under Secretaries Committee to report by
                            September 30 its plans to carry out this directive, and actions already
                            undertaken. Monitoring will thereafter be the responsibility of the
                            Bureau of the Budget, which should make quarterly reports to the Under
                            Secretaries Committee.</p>
                        <p>It is anticipated that the reductions will approximate 14,900 military
                            and 5,100 civilian personnel.</p>
                        <p>The reductions will be based on the actual strengths as of June 30, 1969,
                            as determined by the Bureau of the Budget for the Under Secretaries
                            Committee, minus outstanding BALPA cuts and other programs of reductions
                            which have been approved.</p>
                        <p>The reductions do not apply to U.S. military forces committed to NATO or
                            in <persName corresp="#p_BLH1">Berlin</persName> or essential to their
                            support, to forces stationed in Korea or in Vietnam, or to units
                            stationed elsewhere in Southeast Asia that are directly engaged in
                            related military operations. The exception in these areas does not,
                            however, apply to direct-hire or contract U.S. civilian personnel
                            working with our military commands there.</p>
                        <p>Peace Corps Volunteers, but not administrative personnel, are also
                            exempted.</p>
                        <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0094"/>
                        <p>The reductions should commence as soon as possible, and must be completed
                            during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970.</p>
                        <p>The Committee should also consider means of reducing the number of
                            foreign personnel hired locally by U.S. agencies abroad. Special study
                            should be given to means of reducing U.S. contract personnel whose
                            contracts are not directly with the U.S. Government.</p>
                        <p>Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> will together prepare
                            plans for the reduction in Intelligence Community personnel, submitting
                            these plans for review by the Under Secretaries Committee working group.
                            Recommendations will be made in consonance with the priorities for
                            intelligence coverage established by the United States Intelligence
                            Board, and the objective of a reduction of ten per cent in overseas
                            personnel will be accomplished in such a way as to cause the least
                            possible loss of access to intelligence needed for national security
                            purposes.</p>

                        <p rend="center">The Separation Between Foreign Economic and Political
                            Policy</p>
                        <p>Broadly speaking, the United States during the last two decades has
                            preserved a rather sharp distinction between foreign economic policy and
                            the main lines of foreign policy. This distinction arose partly because
                            of an internal division of labor between economic and political issues
                            within the U.S. Government—and within other governments—but <pb n="67"
                                xml:id="pg_67" facs="0095"/>partly also because of an underlying
                            assumption that the most felicitous economic environment for the
                            achievement of broad U.S. foreign policy objectives is a thriving, open,
                            and non-discriminatory world economy. Trade is so essential to most
                            countries of the world that successful trade performance becomes a
                            precondition for peaceful and cooperative actions in other areas. Thus,
                            given general guidance for the achievement of a liberal trading
                            environment, it was felt that foreign economic policy should be left
                            alone, free from interference by shorter-term political
                            considerations.</p>
                        <p>There have, of course, been exceptions to this separation between
                            economics and politics in foreign affairs. In the realm of East-West
                            trade the United States has maintained tight and discriminatory controls
                            for political reasons. The United States lent strong support to the
                            formation of the European Economic Community, a discriminatory trading
                            bloc, on grounds that were fundamentally political. Foreign aid has
                            always been treated more as an arm of general foreign policy toward the
                            Third World than as an aspect of foreign economic policy. But by and
                            large, international trade negotiations and international monetary
                            discussions have proceeded in their own way and at their own pace, aimed
                            at the broadly political objective of freedom of trade and other
                            economic transactions on a multilateral and non-discriminatory
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>It may be more difficult to preserve this semi-separation between
                            economic and political relations with other countries in the next decade
                            than it has been in the past two decades. Two developments, in
                            particular, introduce new complications: (1) the increasingly complex
                            interaction between foreign trade, international investment, and
                            domestic economic policy, and (2) the growing movement toward
                            preferential trading arrangements. A slightly countervailing tendency is
                            the increasing multilateralization of foreign aid, whereby bilateral
                            political considerations tend to be removed from the donor-recipient
                            relationship.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Trade and Investment</p>
                        <p>Economic relations among industrial countries have broadened
                            considerably, providing today many more points of contact than the mere
                            exchange of merchandise and occasional travelers. Liquid funds move in
                            large volume between major financial centers. Bond markets are tied more
                            closely together. There has been a vast increase in private American
                            investment abroad, involving managerial control. As a result, a growing
                            amount of international trade is intra-firm trade. All of these
                            developments have profound implications for such traditional national
                            economic policies as monetary policy, tax policy, and business
                            regulation.</p>
                        <p>Pressure on national monetary policy has already become acute and has
                            evoked such economically “disintegrative” reactions as the <pb n="68"
                                xml:id="pg_68" facs="0096"/>interest equalization tax and other
                            restraints on capital outflows from the United States, a German tax on
                            foreign holdings of German bonds, prohibition of foreign mutual funds in
                            Italy, and a host of similar devices in most other industrial
                            countries—all designed to preserve some insulation between domestic and
                            foreign monetary conditions. Pressure on national business regulations
                            is still moderate, but it has given rise to international attention and
                            to foreign concern over the “extra-territorial” extension of U.S. laws
                            and regulations, mainly to U.S.-owned firms abroad. With high
                            international mobility giving rise to easy escape from national
                            regulations and restrictions, the problem will grow more serious.</p>
                        <p>The increasing attention being given to “non-tariff barriers” to trade
                            also reflects the more numerous points of contact between domestic and
                            foreign economic policies. With tariffs and other explicit barriers to
                            trade sharply reduced among industrial countries, the temptation will be
                            strong to use more subtle techniques for protective purposes. And
                            measures motivated by health, safety, or revenue considerations rather
                            than by protectionism will nevertheless appear as irritating, and hence
                            suspect, obstacles to actual and prospective foreign exporters.</p>
                        <p>All these developments will compel a searching re-examination, jointly
                            with major countries, of heretofore strictly domestic policy, and this
                            re-examination will create corresponding tension within countries
                            between those segments of the population with a primarily domestic
                            orientation and those whose orientations are increasingly
                            transitional.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Preference Areas</p>
                        <p>The late 1950s and early 1960s were marked by the successful formation of
                            a number of trade preference areas, notably the European Economic
                            Community, but also the European Free Trading Association, the Central
                            American Common Market, and the Latin America Free Trade Area. Countries
                            that for economic or political reasons do not want full association have
                            frequently pressed for partial affiliation to these various trading
                            blocs. Such affiliation is most advanced in the case of the European
                            Economic Community, where to various degrees Greece, Turkey, the French
                            African countries, Nigeria, and East Africa have achieved some sort of
                            special trading status.</p>
                        <p>These arrangements point to a substantial erosion of the U.S. objective
                            of an open, non-discriminatory world trading economy. In combination
                            with the factors noted above, they have led to increased pleas for
                            direct U.S. involvement in special trading arrangements, to which the
                            U.S. yielded in the case of the Canadian automotive pact. As these
                            developments progress, foreign political and foreign economic policies
                            will merge, since bilateral trade pacts not only confer favors, but also
                                <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0097"/>presuppose political harmony
                            and mutual goodwill—or tutelage—for their effective operation. The
                            United States may expect to be put under increasing pressure to
                            acquiesce in such discriminatory trade arrangements and even to
                            participate in them, especially to grant preferential access to Latin
                            American products coming into the U.S. market.</p>
                        <p>For political reasons, the United States has encouraged Britain to join
                            the European Economic Community. British membership would inevitably
                            involve several smaller European countries as well and would create a
                            large and formidable trading area entailing some economic costs to the
                            United States. Consequently, British membership would give rise to
                            internal and international frictions with considerable influence on
                            American foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>In response to pressure from the less developed countries for special
                            trading arrangements, the U.S. has become involved in discussions of a
                            system of world-wide tariff preferences granted by all developed
                            countries to all less developed countries. Certain leaders in the less
                            developed world have laid high hopes on such a scheme. They greatly
                            exaggerate the economic benefits it would bring to their countries, but
                            they consider preferential trading privileges symbolic of the true
                            intentions of the wealthy nations toward the poor ones.</p>
                        <p>The pressure for preferences reflects a very real problem that will
                            become increasingly acute in the next decade—the need for foreign
                            markets for the rapidly growing output of light manufacturers in the
                            less developed countries. As the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>’s
                            develop efficiently, the output of some products will exceed the home
                            demand for them, giving rise to exportable surpluses; and in any case
                            the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>’s will need to earn foreign
                            exchange to keep their economies both operating and growing. The
                            manufactured products they can export competitively are of the
                            “low-wage” type and hence are politically sensitive in virtually all
                            developed countries. Yet successful economic development in the Third
                            World requires a changing structure of world trade and output which the
                            developed countries can ignore only by closing their markets to the very
                            products that the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>’s, in the course
                            of development, are able to produce efficiently. Assurance of foreign
                            markets is a corollary of U.S. encouragement to development efforts, and
                            in the absence of such markets many otherwise promising development
                            prospects will fail.</p>
                        <p rend="center">International Monetary System</p>
                        <p>There are likely to be important changes in the international monetary
                            system over the next decade. The reasons lie in the structure of the
                            present system rather than in the purposes and actions of particular
                            governments. Two principal deficiencies in the present system have
                            become evident in recent years. Our method for generating international
                                <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0098"/>liquidity, necessary to
                            provide the monetary base for growing foreign trade, is inadequate; and
                            our methods for controlling imbalances in international payments are
                            defective. The U.S. balance of payments deficit, a persistent problem
                            for the United States that will continue for at least several years into
                            the future, reflects these more general deficiencies.</p>
                        <p>The traditional form for international liquidity has been gold. Gold was
                            accorded a central although unprominent role in the present payments
                            system, laid down by American and British planners a quarter of a
                            century ago. There is clearly not enough new gold at its present price
                            to serve both the growing monetary needs of the world economy and the
                            enlarged private demands for industrial and artistic uses.</p>
                        <p>The latent shortage of gold would have become evident years ago had not
                            the U.S. dollar served as a kind of surrogate gold in providing
                            international liquidity to nations around the world. (Indeed, one of the
                            problems in framing a sensible policy for the U.S. balance of payments
                            is that U.S. deficits have supplied needed liquidity to the rest of the
                            world.) But this expanded role of the U.S. dollar has left other
                            countries, especially in Europe, uneasy about the capacity implicit in
                            present arrangements for the United States to pursue its international
                            political and economic objectives without regard to the wishes of its
                            allies, while they are nonetheless expected to finance these objectives
                            by accepting and holding dollars in unlimited amounts. Most other
                            advanced nations share broad U.S. objectives, but the very sharp
                            increase in U.S. direct investment in Europe in the early 1960’s and the
                            subsequent escalation of our military expenditures in Vietnam brought
                            home the possibility that they might be called upon to finance very
                            large expenditures, public or private, on which they were not consulted
                            and to which they might even object. For this reason, there is a general
                            unwillingness among major countries to acknowledge the reserve currency
                            role of the dollar as a continuing and permanent feature of the payments
                            system.</p>
                        <p>A solution to the international liquidity problem is near at hand,
                            following five years of negotiation among major countries, in the
                            creation of Special Drawing Rights (<gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                            >SDR</gloss>’s). These will offer a new, manmade form of surrogate gold
                            unrelated to any particular national currency. Creation of <gloss
                                target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>’s will represent a far reaching step in
                            international monetary cooperation, and with continuing goodwill it will
                            solve the problem of a shortage of monetary gold.</p>
                        <p>The second deficiency in the payments system concerns the correction of
                            imbalances in international payments. Countries pursue separate policies
                            and they are subject to separate pressures and disturbances. <pb n="71"
                                xml:id="pg_71" facs="0099"/>They have divergent rates of growth, and
                            the impact of economic growth on the balance of payments varies from
                            country to country. Their choices between inflation and unemployment and
                            with respect to foreign policy will differ. For all these reasons,
                            countries are bound from time to time to experience imbalances in their
                            international payments. The Vietnam war provides a recent dramatic
                            example, where for reasons of national security, overseas expenditures
                            for the United States were increased sharply.</p>
                        <p>Under the present rules, laid down twenty-five years ago, temporary
                            imbalances in payments are to be financed out of international reserves
                            and by borrowing directly and indirectly from creditor nations. Where an
                            imbalance persists, it is to be corrected by a change in the value of
                            the country’s currency with respect to other currencies; that is, a
                            change in its exchange rate. This mode of adjustment has been difficult
                            to apply in practice, however, and has become increasingly disruptive of
                            international financial order. Countries in payments surplus are not
                            under the same kinds of pressure as countries in deficit to adjust their
                            exchange rate in response to a persistent imbalance. Considerations of
                            international prestige dictate postponement of exchange rate changes,
                            for a change in the value of the currency is (sometimes wrongly) taken
                            as an acknowledgment of poor economic policies. Finally, public
                            anticipation of changes in exchange rates give rise to large and
                            disruptive movements of speculative funds, out of currencies expected to
                            be devalued, into currencies expected to be revalued. With the growing
                            international mobility of capital, these speculative movements have
                            grown dramatically in size.</p>
                        <p>The currency crises during 1967-1969 reflect this deficiency in the
                            present payment system. In late 1967 large movements of funds preceded
                            devaluation of the British pound—indeed partly forced it as Britain
                            exhausted its reserves—and large amounts of funds have been moved out of
                            France and into Germany during the subsequent period, all in
                            anticipation of changes in exchange rates. The absence of an effective
                            adjustment process will induce countries in periods of financial strain
                            either (a) to deflate their domestic economies beyond what is desirable
                            on domestic grounds or, more likely, (b) to impose tight controls on
                            their economic transactions with the rest of the world, thereby
                            violating the basic open and non-discriminatory world trading economy
                            which the United States has strived to achieve. Such controls have been
                            used with increasing frequency, after a long period of gradual
                            relaxation of the restraints on international transactions imposed
                            during and immediately following the Second World War. If these
                            violations are not to become increasingly severe and more widespread,

                            />process must be markedly improved in the coming years; for example, by
                            improving the methods by which exchange rate changes can be utilized as
                            part of the process.</p>
                        <p>The weakness of the structure of the U.S. balance of payments has been
                            masked during the past year by large inflows of short-term funds
                            attracted by high interest rates in the American economy. A change in
                            domestic economic conditions should lead to substantial improvements in
                            the trade balance but probably not enough to correct the basic
                            imbalance. This is an additional reason for the United States to be
                            interested in more general improvements in the process of
                            balance-of-payment adjustments.</p>

                                <item>The payments effects of all government transactions leveled
                                    off during the past two years at about $2 billion net
                                    deficit.</item>

                                <item>This figure, however, includes window-dressing receipts of

                                    window-dressing statistical gimmickery, however, the total net

                                <item>The Defense Department accounts for over two-thirds of the
                                    gross payments—almost $5 billion annually—and is responsible for
                                    the total net deficit on regular transactions plus offsetting
                                    the effect of the special transactions.</item>

                                    somewhat in 1970. Much of the inflow is return on previous

                                    major source of the U.S. payments deficit, has steadily reduced
                                    its foreign payments to the relatively small figure of $145
                                    million in 1970. This is a good bit less than half its receipts
                                    and less than the combined payments of Interior, NASA and the
                                    Panama Canal. The <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> receipts
                                    are mainly repayments on past loans.</item>

                        <p>Analytically, this report is useful but cannot be simply compared with
                            our overall payments position—as many people do to conclude that “the
                            deficit is caused by the government spending.” This is because there are
                            large offsetting feedbacks to the government expenditures which show up
                            in the private accounts.</p>
                        <p>For example, Korea and Thailand would not buy as many U.S. exports if
                            they earned no dollars from <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss>
                            programs. Even Japan and major countries in Europe adopt easier economic
                            policies because of our military expenditures there, of which some share
                            comes back to us. This is not to say that government expenditures are
                            not a major factor in our payments deficit—but simply to flag the error
                            in simplistic comparisons.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MCPW1">Paul McCracken</persName> comments that we
                            should carefully consider the domestic economic effects of the policies,
                            which we inherited from the previous Administration, to minimize foreign
                            expenditures for government programs. He is referring to such practices
                            as the 50 percent preference extended by <gloss target="#t_DOD1"
                                >DoD</gloss> to domestic suppliers and <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss>’s tying policies, which create some balance of payments
                            savings but are quite costly in budgetary terms. (Reductions in the
                            level of our overseas programs, as per your recent directive on
                            personnel and the Vietnam troop withdrawals, of course help our balance
                            of payments. <persName corresp="#p_MCPW1">McCracken</persName> is here
                            referring to the foreign exchange costs of a fixed level of government
                            programs.)</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Arthur Burns</persName>, on the other hand,
                            suggests that you ask the Treasury Department to make recommendations on
                            steps to reduce further the balance of payments costs of overseas
                            government expenditures. Any such steps would probably carry the
                            increased <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0102"/>budgetary costs
                            mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_MCPW1">McCracken</persName> and have
                            small payments effects, unless they represented major program
                                changes.<note n="3" xml:id="d27fn3">In the margin next to this

                                    >Burns</persName>’ suggestion, in the first sentence of the

                                sentence, which he said would put the President in error. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BCF1">Bergsten</persName> wrote: “I am sure that

                                strongly about his suggestion, which was made August 11, and I see
                                no reasons to pursue the matter any further, since no action is
                                called for under either interpretation. Inaction is particularly
                                appropriate because of the uncertainty over the ‘no’meaning and in
                                view of <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName>’ sensitivity
                                over his memos going to the President through you.” On September 29

                            income is accorded preferential tax treatment under German law.<note

                            Germans raised this issue in NATO in 1968, and have raised it through
                            our Embassy in Bonn on several other occasions. In essence, they seek a
                            “tax-sparing” concession under which the United States would give a
                            foreign tax credit for an <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0103"/>amount
                            of German tax which has not in fact been paid—for a tax which has been
                            spared by virtue of the German tax subsidy. Treasury’s policy in the
                            past has been to oppose any tax—sparing provision with respect to
                            Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Such a provision would require legislation, or a treaty amendment
                            approved by a two-thirds quorum vote of the Senate, and there is reason
                            to believe that we would have great difficulty in selling this idea on
                            the Hill, particularly in view of the fact that the Senate has
                            previously refused to go along with tax-sparing proposals, or even with
                            the extension of the investment tax credit-a more modest incentive than
                            tax-sparing-to stimulate U.S. investment abroad in the context of our
                            tax treaties with less-developed countries.</p>
                        <p>There are several factors which we feel militate against the German
                            request. First, we believe the Federal Republic of Germany is in a
                            sufficiently strong economic position to enable it to subsidize the
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLH1">Berlin</persName> economy in ways which
                            would not, in order to be completely effective, require the United
                            States to give up the tax normally due. The United States is being asked
                            to make a questionable departure from established practice and policy
                            which is not necessary to achieve the German objectives for the
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLH1">Berlin</persName> economy. In any case,
                            given the U.S. balance of payments position vis-à-vis Germany, any
                            special provision to encourage the outflow of U.S. capital to that
                            country seems unwarranted. Second, the incentive effect of the lower
                            corporate tax in <persName corresp="#p_BLH1">Berlin</persName> is not
                            necessarily nullified by our system of taxation, since under current law
                            the U.S. tax is only applicable (except in certain abuse situations) to
                            repatriated profits from U.S. subsidiaries in Berlin. Therefore, if
                            profits are retained abroad, the <persName corresp="#p_BLH1"
                                >Berlin</persName> corporate tax incentive remains viable. Third,
                            where there are U.S. corporations doing business in <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLH1">Berlin</persName> with excess foreign tax credits
                            generated through their other German operations (or, in the case of U.S.
                            taxpayers using the “overall” foreign tax credit limitation, their
                            worldwide operations) such excess credits can be applied to reduce the
                            U.S. tax on income from investments in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>There are other considerations which reinforce the above arguments,
                            including how we could justify this exception to countries such as
                            Jamaica and Ireland that have already requested similar treatment. Our
                            balance of payments program has generally distinguished between
                            industrialized countries and <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>’s, with
                            the latter receiving special consideration; if we willingly discriminate
                            in favor of a strong industrialized country, we can certainly expect
                            complaints from other countries and, based on past experience, perhaps
                            from such international organizations as the <gloss target="#t_OECD1"

                                    have experienced a drain on their dollar holdings. Despite the
                                    worsening in the structure of the U.S. balance of payments, the
                                    inflow of short-term funds through U.S. banks has kept the
                                    dollar strong in exchange markets by making the holding of
                                    dollars attractive to private individuals, business and

                                        <item>In 1968 the deficit on the liquidity basis improved
                                            substantially as a result of the January 1 balance of
                                            payments program, and the surge of foreign purchases in
                                            the U.S. stock market, despite a fall-off in the trade
                                            surplus. But the official settlements position improved
                                            even more, as a result of the Eurodollar inflow.</item>

                                        <item>In the first half of 1969, the liquidity balance
                                            deteriorated sharply for a variety of reasons: a further
                                            fall in the trade surplus, a drop-off in stock purchases
                                            by foreigners, an increase in direct investment
                                            outflows, and the attraction of American funds to the
                                            Eurodollar market. But the official settlements balance
                                            was in sizable surplus, again because of the Eurodollar
                                            inflow.</item>

                                        <item>The U.S. payments position has thus been protected in
                                            the past two years by short-term borrowing—in an amount
                                            exceeding $10 billion.</item>

                                <item>This protection has come to an end. A mere cessation of the
                                    Eurodollar inflow is enough to throw the official settlements
                                    balance into deficit (as has happened in the past two months).
                                    If, as seems likely, U.S. banks begin to repay Eurodollar
                                    borrowings, the official settlements deficit will probably
                                    exceed the liquidity deficit.</item>

                                        <item>No doubt, there is some appetite abroad for additional
                                            dollars at the moment. Some countries—notably the United
                                            Kingdom and France—have debts to repay. Others would be
                                            pleased to rebuild their dollar holdings, which have
                                            been depleted in the past two years.</item>

                            November 21 from 10:21 to 11:10 a.m., the President and the Prime
                            Minister discussed an accommodation on textiles. The Prime Minister said
                            he was bound by a unanimous resolution in the Diet against a bilateral
                            agreement with the United States on textiles. The President suggested
                            that before the United States “at an appropriate time” took the issue to
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> he and the Prime Minister
                            attempt to work out a common position in order to avoid a confrontation
                            in Geneva. Documentation on the bilateral textile negotiations is
                            scheduled for publication in a forthcoming Foreign Relations volume
                            covering Japan. At the November 20 meeting the President and Prime
                            Minister also discussed trade and capital liberalization and Japan’s
                            economic role in Asia. Regarding liberalization, the President said that
                            if <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> could make a good
                            statement on liberalization it would help him hold protectionism at bay
                            domestically: “if Japan, which currently enjoyed such a favorable
                            balance of trade, did not relax its restrictions people here would
                            question why we should.” The Prime Minister “agreed completely” with the
                            President that apart from textiles they should broadly move toward freer
                            trade.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that “Japan was now at a point where it could play a
                            greater role … not just in Asia but on the world scene … that Japan
                            should move to a ‘higher posture’ in the area of trade, investment,
                            political development of Asia and, to the extent we can agree between us
                            even in security … the world would be healthier if Japan could be added
                            ‘as a fifth finger’ to the four existing areas of great power, the
                            United States, Western Europe, the Soviet Union and China.” Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> replied that he
                            hoped the Japanese people understood how much they were indebted to the
                            United States for its assistance and cooperation after World War II, and
                            how it had been “quite a shock to Japan” to learn that the Allied Powers
                            had been preparing postwar Japan policy during the height of the war. In
                            that context, and without making any firm commitments, he and the
                            President exchanged views on how Japan might cooperate in Asian
                            development during the post-Vietnam period.</p>

                        <p>Our balance of payments has been in deficit for a decade. During the
                            recent election campaign the President strongly criticized the
                            Democratic administration for not having taken steps to cure this
                            serious problem. Since we have been in office we have already had a
                            modest relaxation of foreign investment control. In the first year of
                            this Administration the balance of payments deficit has risen
                            dramatically to a $10 billion deficit on a liquidity basis, two and
                            one-half times the previous peak figure. The outlook for 1970 is not
                            encouraging.</p>
                        <p>Our apparent unwillingness to take strong action in this area as opposed
                            to the strong action taken in other areas, such as monetary and <pb

                            in the US and abroad as to the seriousness with which we regard this
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Based on the above, I strongly recommend liberalization for investment in

                            decision. I urge you to take up the matter orally with the President as

                        <p>I found great concern over the effect which our tight money and high
                            interest rates were having on European economies. Yet, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> told me privately
                            that the Common Market Finance Ministers were afraid that we would not
                            or could not control our inflation and would continue to experience such
                            serious balance of payments deficits as to imperil world confidence in
                            the dollar and threaten the international monetary system.</p>
                        <p>The hope was expressed that we could achieve more restraint through the
                            budget and the reports which I had to give them on the tax <pb n="86"
                                xml:id="pg_86" facs="0114"/>bill were very discouraging. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> suggested an “interest rate
                            disarmament” conference among a few major countries with the objective
                            of lowering interest rates about 2 percentage points without
                            precipitating disruptive international capital flows. I asked him to
                            give us a little more time to break the back of inflation, but we may
                            want to do this in the spring.</p>
                        <p>I found <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> ready to move
                            ahead on the studies of limited exchange rate flexibility as a means of
                            strengthening the international monetary system. He feels that the
                            achievement of common economic policies and uniform price movements
                            within the Common Market is at least a decade away and agrees that in
                            the meantime we must be able to use exchange rate changes as a means of
                            adjustment within the Common Market as well as with other countries.
                            Witteveen and <persName corresp="#p_ZJ1">Zijlstra</persName> also agree
                            that a common central bank for the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> is
                            a final step which is many years away. <persName corresp="#p_RJ8"
                                >Rey</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BR2">Barre</persName>, on
                            the other hand, want to eliminate the possibility of exchange rate
                            change by individual Common Market countries as soon as possible and
                            hope to get agreement within the next year that any such changes would
                            require unanimous consent. If we are to avoid recurrent financial
                            crises, I believe we must make it easier, not harder, for countries to
                            appreciate their currencies against the dollar and I am convinced that
                            it will be necessary to preserve this option for individual Common
                            Market countries for many years to come.</p>
                        <p>I told my hosts that in striving to improve our balance of payments we
                            were concentrating on fundamentals—first and foremost on the control of
                            inflation. But I also referred to our efforts to negotiate the reduction
                            of barriers against U.S. exports, our desire to remove the disadvantage
                            to our trade resulting from the employment of the value added tax system
                            in Europe, and our concern over the prospective proliferation of
                            preferential trading arrangements between the Common Market and its
                            neighboring countries in Europe which are not prospective members.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> made it quite clear that
                            the Communities expect to conclude a network of such arrangements
                            (Spain, Israel, Switzerland, Sweden, etc.). Our trade will be adversely
                            affected and our support of the Common Market may be called into
                            question politically at home.</p>
                        <p>While I was in Europe, the free market price of gold dropped to $35.00
                            and many of the Europeans were anxious to find a way to ensure that it
                            did not drop significantly below that level. It seems apparent that if
                            it did—at least by any substantial amount and for any significant period
                            of time—a number of European central banks would step in to support the
                            market, either through the Bank for International Settlements or
                            directly. I left Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VPA1"
                                >Volcker</persName> in Europe to negotiate with the South Africans
                            on this issue, and I am hopeful that we can reach an agreement which
                            will keep the price from falling further and thus make <pb n="87"

                            The French pointedly reminded me, however, that they have never adhered
                            to the Washington agreement of last year and consider themselves free to
                            buy or sell on the free market at any time.</p>
                        <p>My conversations touched briefly on a few other points. There was support
                            for the view that the question of a possible link between Special
                            Drawing Rights and aid to less developed countries ought not to be
                            considered until the world has had experience with the <gloss
                                target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> and it has been accepted. Initiating
                            studies of this question now would be most inadvisable.</p>
                        <p>Finally, <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName>
                            suggested that we might consider jointly how our two countries could
                            deal with the enforcement problems presented by the Swiss banking
                            secrecy laws. I plan to follow through on this suggestion.</p>
                        <p>It is evident that we and the French still have some troublesome
                            differences of approach to the problems of the monetary system.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> showed a personal
                            interest in discussing these differences and I plan to invite him to the

                        <p>My conversations on this trip have left me more firmly convinced than
                            ever that the major countries of the world have become so interdependent
                            economically and financially that not even the large European countries
                            can achieve their economic objectives in the absence of U.S. price
                            stability. Our responsibility to stop inflation and use our leadership
                            wisely is not limited to the citizens of our own country but is a
                            responsibility to the world.</p>

                            <item>U.S. foreign economic assistance was “tied” to U.S. procurement
                                beginning in 1959, originally as a method of offsetting lagging
                                Congressional support of the program. Presentationally, it was
                                argued that tying almost totally eliminated the balance of payments
                                costs of foreign aid: by providing real resources rather than
                                financial resources. In addition we benefited our exporters while
                                accomplishing the development task and the procedure made our aid
                                funds only marginally less efficient—but this was a cost deemed
                                necessary to assure sustained adequate levels of aid
                                appropriations.</item>

                            <item>Both inside and outside the Executive branch question arose on the
                                validity of the claim that tying aid virtually removed the balance
                                of payments costs of the program. This generated pressures to ensure
                                “additionality,” i.e. that aid financed exports were additional to
                                goods that aid recipient countries would have purchased from the
                                U.S. commercially in any event. The techniques to bring about
                                “additionality” varied from country to country but they rapidly led
                                to resentment and the development of political problems with
                                developing countries.</item>

                            <item>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>’s decision
                                last June to eliminate the “additionality” requirements under our
                                foreign aid program was prompted by a desire to eliminate this
                                political lightning rod from attracting anti-U.S. sentiment in the
                                aid countries. This had the effect of reducing the effectiveness of
                                aid tying. Since that time the tying rules have been further relaxed
                                in the case of Latin America. Henceforth U.S. aid dollars lent to
                                finance imports may be used to procure commodities in either the
                                United States or in Latin American countries. The latter is being
                                given a further advantage of qualifying for such procurement even
                                when the imported component of the item being sold amounts to fifty
                                percent (for U.S. suppliers, only ten percent imported component is
                                normally allowed). The President also decided that tying
                                restrictions be lifted completely for U.S. aid dollars going to
                                Latin America to finance local costs. He decided a similar

                                        for “world-wide” procurement since recipient countries will

                                        use.</item>
                                    <item>—While the measure is now a regional preference for Latin

                                        and evidence of already mounting pressures for partial or
                                        full untying elsewhere in the less developed world suggest

                            <item>Determining the “true” balance of payments effects of aid tying
                                has been and continues to be a statistical playground. Past
                                estimates within the Executive Branch of the “cost” of a given tying
                                (or untying) measure have varied widely, with State/<gloss
                                    target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> generally on the low or “de
                                minimis” side, Commerce generally on the high side and Treasury
                                generally in a tentative middle posture. As evidence of this, in
                                calculations last year of the “benefits” from the additionality
                                program, State/<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> estimated $35
                                million world-wide, Commerce estimated upwards of $350 million and
                                Treasury estimated something in excess of $125 million. For Latin
                                America hemispheric untying, Treasury estimated $200 million balance
                                of payments costs. The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> used a
                                $50 million estimate. From there on, the costs were “nibbled” away

                            <item>Perhaps a better way of looking at the costs of untying is in the
                                context of what we are doing relative to other aid giving countries.
                                If, for example, other donor countries untied their aid
                                simultaneously with the untying of U.S. aid, we would presumably
                                pick up some additional procurement under their programs. However,
                                other programs in the aggregate amount to less than the U.S.
                                program. Nevertheless, their aggregate share of exports to the
                                    <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s greatly exceeds that of the
                                U.S. Consequently, what the U.S. balance of payments would gain from
                                untying by other donors would fall far short of what would be lost
                                through the untying of the U.S. program. Specifically, with the U.S.
                                providing roughly 50 percent of total aid to <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                    >LDC</gloss>s and providing only 25 percent of total exports to
                                    <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s, with complete worldwide
                                untying we would stand to incur a balance of payments loss in the
                                aggregate, of at least one half of the total amount of our aid
                                program.</item>

                            <item>It is clear to me that the tying of aid is on the way out, and I
                                think it is desirable that this is the case. This is a form of
                                selective control that is not in keeping with our philosophy, and it
                                is certainly not the most efficient form of economic assistance.
                                However, many countries tie, and it is in keeping with our
                                leadership role that if we go to untying beyond Latin America that
                                we do it in a “burden sharing” manner in which all other donor
                                countries also untie. However, further unilateral untying by the
                                United States would jeopardize our negotiating position in getting
                                other donors to join us. Consequently, I would recommend that the
                                National Advisory Council recommend to the President an initiative
                                to be taken by the United States at the <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                                    >OECD</gloss> Ministerial Meeting in May whereby the United
                                States would propose that we negotiate—probably through <gloss

                                Committee—the multilateral untying of bilateral assistance by donor
                                countries. The <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> would also
                                consider how far a multilateral proposal would go toward complete
                                aid untying. Many countries are as attached to aid tying as we have
                                been. They will not quickly accede to this suggestion; but by making
                                this gesture, the U.S. would get the immediate political benefits
                                with the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s; and we will move the
                                developed countries along toward this desirable objective. It would
                                permit us in the meantime to discontinue further unilateral
                                untying—so that the time framework would be more in pace with our
                                removal of selective controls over direct investment and banks.
                                Right now we run the danger of removing most government balance of
                                payments controls and still being left with the Commerce and Fed
                                controls.</item>

                            know what importance he should give to the statements by Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName> concerning the
                            fears and even opposition to the European Common Market by the United
                                States.<note n="4" xml:id="d36fn4">Not further identified.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> replied, “None.”
                            In his view it was very important for the European Common Market to
                            develop in its own way. It will be increasingly competitive with the
                            U.S. as the U.K. comes in and it may become a rather serious problem for
                            us in an economic sense. But the President said he took the long view
                            that a strong productive European Community including the United Kingdom
                            is in the interest of world peace and stability. The U.S. would have to
                            pay some costs for achieving this bigger goal and the President did not
                            agree with those who rejected this point.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> said he had
                            spoken about this to the Congressional leaders he had received the
                            previous day.<note n="4" target="#d36fn4">Not further identified.</note>
                            It was certain that as the European Community developed it may cause
                            economic rivalry. The French would do all they could to insure that it
                            would be open and as liberal as possible so that economic tensions would
                            not become awkward. One should not be too impressed by political figures
                            in France and in the U.S. who are sensitive to the worries of their
                            constituents. Many protested against the French agricultural system
                            which did have many faults, but he could say that the sales of U.S.
                            agricultural surpluses to Europe had doubled since 1958.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said that as
                            President <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> had said at
                            dinner, if we could only get agricultural subsidies off our books we
                            would be able to give all sorts of assistance to the underdeveloped
                            countries, and added, “some day we must bite that bullet.”</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> emphasized the
                            fact that the U.S. dollar is the pivot or the reference point on which
                            the international monetary system rests. He feels that the system can
                            only function well if the dollar maintains a stable value. Failure of
                            the United States to preserve price stability forces all other countries
                            either to accept inflation in their own countries or to revalue their
                            currencies—an action which, he said, was politically extremely
                            difficult.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName> and I assured the
                            President that we were very conscious of this responsibility to the
                            world and were determined to bring inflation under control. Restoration
                            of general price stability was a primary objective of our policy. Given
                            the extent of pent-up demand for investment, we did not feel that there
                            was a great danger of recession.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> also said that a
                            perpetual U.S. balance of payments deficit would lead to a dollar crisis
                            which would become a general world economic crisis.</p>
                        <p>My answer was that we were attacking the fundamentals of the payments
                            problem through our attack on inflation. I had Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> describe the other elements in
                            our balance of payments program.</p>
                        <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0122"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> feels that
                            international payments problems should be dealt with—not by setting up a
                            mechanism for greater flexibility of exchange rates—but by stopping
                            inflation and thus obviating the need for exchange rate changes. He
                            noted the trend in the Common Market toward freezing of rates.</p>
                        <p>I assured President <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> that
                            we did not look upon increased flexibility of exchange rates as a means
                            of escaping the responsibility of achieving and preserving general price
                            stability in the United States. We did feel, however, that the
                            possibility of employing techniques for limited exchange rate
                            flexibility to strengthen the monetary system ought to be carefully
                            examined.</p>
                        <p>I stressed the importance of continuing consultations and close
                            cooperation in the financial sphere among the major countries and
                            mentioned specifically the forthcoming visit of French Minister of
                            Finance <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName>, who
                            has accepted my invitation for a meeting at Camp David in early May.</p>

                        <p>On March 2, 1970, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                            sent a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_HHR1">Haldeman</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_EJD1">Ehrlichman</persName>, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, “for discussion with the
                            group and implementation,” reflecting on his and their use of time
                            during the first year of the administration. The President concluded
                            that “the greatest weakness was in spreading my time too thin—not
                            emphasizing priorities enough.” He wanted new rules that applied to his
                            time to apply to <persName corresp="#p_EJD1">Ehrlichman</persName>’s and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>’s time as well, and
                            lower priority issues to be handled by the Executive agencies and White
                            House staff.</p>
                        <p>The foreign policy issues the President wanted brought to his attention
                            were East-West relations, policy toward the Soviet Union, policy toward
                            Communist China, policy toward Eastern Europe to the extent it affected
                            East-West relations at the highest level, and policy toward Western
                            Europe where NATO and the major countries (Britain, Germany, and France)
                            were involved. At the “next level out” was policy toward the Middle
                            East, followed by policy toward Vietnam and anything related to Vietnam,
                            Laos, and Cambodia. For the rest of Asia <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95"
                                facs="0123"/>and most of Africa and Latin America, the President did
                            not want matters submitted to him unless they required a decision that
                            could only be handled at the Presidential level.</p>
                        <p>The President turned to specific economic matters under the domestic
                            affairs rubric, where he would take personal responsibility where the
                            decisions affected recession or inflation. In his memorandum the
                            President wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I do not want to be bothered with international monetary

                                        >Kissinger</persName> should note also, and I will not need
                                    to see the reports on international monetary matters in the
                                    future. Problems should be farmed out, I would hope to <persName

                                    to assume it on a confidential basis, and if not <persName

                                        corresp="#p_HH1">Houthakker</persName> who is very capable
                                    in this field. I have no confidence in the Treasury people since
                                    they will be acting in a routine way. International monetary
                                    matters, incidentally, are a case in point in making the
                                    difficult decision as to priorities. I feel we need a new
                                    international monetary system and I have so indicated in several
                                    meetings. Very little progress has been made in this direction
                                    because of the opposition of Treasury. I shall expect someone
                                    from the White House staff who will be designated who will keep
                                    the pressure on in this area. The man, however, who could really
                                    be the lead man is <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Arthur
                                        Burns</persName> because he feels exactly as I do and it
                                    might be that he could exert some influence on the others….
                                    Where an item like foreign aid is concerned I do not want to be
                                    bothered unless it directly affects East-West relations…. A lot
                                    of miscellaneous items are not covered in this memorandum but I
                                    think you will be able to apply the rules … trade policy is a
                                    case in point. This is something where it just isn’t going to
                                    make a lot of difference whether we move one way or another on
                                    the glass tariff. Oil import is also a case in point. While it
                                    has some political consequences it is not something I should
                                    become deeply involved in.” (National Archives, <persName

                        <p>The United States seeks over time a pattern of international trade and
                            payments which will serve the basic objective of expanding the
                            multilateral system under which national economies achieve greater
                            efficiency in an atmosphere of fewer and fewer restrictions on the
                            exchange of goods, capital and services. When and if the United States
                            payments position is strong, this type of multilateral system allows our
                            basic foreign policy of peace through partnership to be pursued with
                            less strain on the dollar and the international monetary system.</p>
                        <p>We require the composition of our international transactions to be such
                            as will preserve world confidence in the U.S. dollar as (a) a vehicle
                            for international transactions; (b) a preferred form in which to hold
                            national reserves and a satisfactory standard for an international
                            payments system conducive to sound economic growth throughout the world.
                            We require a record in our international trade and payments which leaves
                            us free to pursue full employment, a satisfactory rate of economic
                            growth, reasonable price stability and an equitable distribution of
                            income at home, without causing excessive strain on our net liquidity
                            position.</p>
                        <p>The balance in our goods and services transactions should show a
                            substantial surplus.<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">According to <persName

                                balance of trade surplus of about 1/2 of 1 percent of <gloss

                                a trillion dollar <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>, and a goods
                                and services surplus, excluding government grant transfers, of $6.5
                                to $7 billion.</note> A surplus on merchandise trade and services
                            will in itself be an important factor in preserving confidence in the
                            dollar. To contribute to confidence, however, this surplus would
                            probably need to compare favorably, as a proportion of <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>, with that of other major industrial
                            nations. We can expect income from direct investment to continue to
                            rise, but we must also anticipate that the increase will tend to be
                            offset by rising net tourist outflows and such other invisibles.</p>
                        <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0125"/>
                        <p>Only by such a surplus can we afford our military and political postures
                            abroad and supply real capital to less developed countries and to other
                            nations requiring foreign capital for the development of their
                            resources. Should we fail to restore and then maintain such a surplus,
                            we would progressively erode the dollar’s role—itself the fulcrum to the
                            monetary system. With a reduction of world confidence in the dollar,
                            public and Congressional support for a liberal trading and investment
                            policy would further diminish, along with support for our military
                            commitments overseas.</p>

                            Department’s study shows practically no adverse effects to our
                            industrial exports if the Community is enlarged to ten, and moderate (up
                            to $300 million maximum damage) if complete free trade arrangements are
                            extended to all the <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> neutrals.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s study estimates damage to our agricultural trade of $100
                            million if <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss> prices remain
                            unchanged.</p>
                        <p>The dissenting agencies do not quarrel directly with these studies,
                            although they play up the imprecision of any quantitative projections.
                            Agriculture’s estimates of damage to the world grain market are more
                            moderate than the Department’s and about the same for damage to U.S.
                            exports. <gloss target="#t_USDA1">USDA</gloss> does, however, express
                            concern that U.S. soybean sales may somehow be threatened. The
                            Department sees no reason why enlargement should in any way reinforce or
                            renew the threat to soybeans which has been successfully warded off. Our
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> rights for soybeans in both
                            the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> and the UK are strong and
                            uncontested. <gloss target="#t_USDA1">USDA</gloss> also anticipates
                            sharp losses (unquantified and unexplained) for US exports of tobacco,
                            lard, and canned fruits. The Department’s studies do not bear out this
                            concern. Both the Department and <gloss target="#t_USDA1">USDA</gloss>
                            agree that other suppliers of beef products, dairy products and sugar
                            would be hurt. The U.S. has quotas on these commodities, but we may be
                            under some pressure to enlarge or alter them.</p>
                        <p>All agencies agree that the longer term dynamic effects will be more
                            important. The Department’s study points out that the income growth will
                            lead to increased European imports, but that the enhanced competitive
                            position of Europe, and some of its common policies may have an adverse
                            effect on U.S. economic interests. The Department’s conclusions are that
                            the Common Market has been a boon to our industrial exports and
                            investments. British accession, the Department feels, will reinforce the
                            basically liberal outlook of the Commission, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss>, The Netherlands and others.</p>
                        <p>The dissenting agencies are more pessimistic concerning the future. They
                            see our competitive position eroding and they believe that enlargement
                            and further deepening of the Community will result in a number of
                            autarkic measures aimed at the U.S. in both trade and investment. In
                            particular they express concern that preferential industrial and
                            procurement policies would adversely affect nearly $4 billion of high
                            technology items or over 35 percent of total U.S. exports to Europe.</p>
                        <p>The Department sees no basis in fact or discernible trends to warrant
                            such a pessimistic conclusion.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>While no one suggests questioning the basic policy of support for the
                            Community and its enlargement, the differences in appraisal are
                            reflected in different overall strategies and recommendations.</p>
                        <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0127"/>
                        <p>All agencies appear to agree on both continuing support for European
                            unity and enlargement of the Community, as well as on the need to
                            influence developments in the Community in such a way as to maximize our
                            economic benefits and minimize our losses.</p>
                        <p>All agree that we should, in connection with the negotiations, exercise
                            fully our <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> rights augmented by
                            bilateral and multilateral diplomacy. All would agree that we should
                            continue to follow internal developments in the Community and influence
                            them in our best interest.</p>
                        <p>The dissenting agencies, however, adopt a harder and more interventionist
                            tone. They would invoke the U.S. troop presence in Europe and other
                            elements of leverage. They would make the participants in the
                            enlargement negotiations see that the ability of any U.S. administration
                            to maintain its military relationship with Europe could be jeopardized
                            if there was serious damage to our economic interests. They would want
                            us “promptly and firmly” to demonstrate by our statements and our
                            actions an intent to protect our basic economic and financial interests.
                            We would “make clear without delay” or “stress at the outset” a number
                            of U.S. desiderata and “that we are prepared to use such leverage as is
                            available to us as a world power.”</p>
                        <p>It is clear from the discussions in the ad hoc group and the drafting
                            group that what these words are meant to convey is a major and clear-cut
                            effort to put the Europeans on notice. The Department does not believe
                            that such a diplomatic campaign is required by the facts. We believe it
                            would be interpreted in Europe as a clear reversal of the President’s
                            position on European unity and on nonintervention in the process of
                            unification. It would be read as a signal that henceforth we will put
                            our economic and commercial interests above our political objectives.
                            The agencies, at least on the working level, wish the U.S. to give such
                            a signal, and in the paper submitted by Treasury, Commerce and
                            Agriculture, have come close to saying so explicitly.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the agencies would pose specific conditions to
                            enlargement—the toughest being in agriculture where they would insist
                            that there be a reduction in agricultural protection. <gloss
                                target="#t_USDA1">USDA</gloss> would have us stress that a midpoint
                            between present <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> and UK grain prices
                            “would be acceptable.”</p>
                        <p>The Department agrees with the other agencies that we should use what
                            leverage we can to effect a lowering of <gloss target="#t_CAP1"
                                >CAP</gloss> grain prices. The problem is that this is likely to be
                            the most intractable aspect of the negotiations. We believe we may be
                            able to influence or reinforce a trend in the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss> towards more sensible prices, but we are unlikely to get
                            very much in the course of the enlargement negotiation and for the U.S.
                            to pose hard conditions may well jeopardize the negotiations. There is
                                <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0128"/>no disagreement and no
                            apparent problem on maintaining UK and <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>
                            zero bindings for soybeans.</p>
                        <p>The agencies would also make clear in connection with the accession
                            negotiation our opposition to what are only distant dangers in
                            connection with the ongoing development of the Community. Specifically,
                            they mention nontariff barriers such as a “buy European” policy. <gloss
                                target="#t_STR1">STR</gloss> wants us to make clear we would expect
                            compensation for trade and investment barriers not the inevitable result
                            of a customs union.</p>
                        <p>The Department feels it would be diplomatically inappropriate to
                            intervene in the negotiations by “making clear” in connection with the
                            enlargement negotiation a number of positions which relate to the
                            internal work of the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> and which will
                            not arise as part of the enlargement negotiation. To do so would only be
                            interpreted as a major diplomatic campaign reversing U.S. policy on the
                            Community. We have other ways of defending our interests on the
                            Community’s internal development and have a pretty good record so
                            far.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the points the agencies would have us make would be
                            interpreted as challenging the right of the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss> to develop an economic union as opposed to a mere
                            customs union. If we want the European countries to become more united
                            economically and politically, we cannot object to their adopting a
                            collective procurement policy or a common investment policy. We can try
                            to influence the content of such policies in a liberal outward looking
                            direction. But it would be contrary to our policy of encouragement of
                            unity if we were to seek to block the development of common
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>The dissenting agencies would also have the U.S. actively seek to
                            establish a continuing consultative mechanism through which we could be
                            kept informed of the negotiations and register our concerns. The
                            Department feels that we should be prepared to respond positively to a
                            European initiative for a US-<gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>
                            consultative mechanism, but we doubt that the French will permit the
                                <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> to set up such a mechanism at this
                            time. Furthermore, to request such a mechanism in connection with the
                            negotiation would be interpreted as intervention and resented by the
                            parties. Such a request would also encourage other affected countries
                            less interested in the success of the negotiations to seek to read
                            themselves into negotiations. The Department believes that we can rely
                            on normal diplomatic channels and informal high level visits, as well as
                            existing international forums such as the <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                                >OECD</gloss> to keep ourselves informed and to make our views
                            known.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Department’s strategy, besides trying to influence the
                            accession negotiations and the continuing internal development of the
                            Community, also contemplates engaging the Community in multilateral
                            negotiations. Some of the agencies during our discussions expressed
                            doubts about the feasibility or desirability of a major new round of
                            trade negotiations in the near term. The dissenting agencies do not view
                            such a <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0129"/>negotiation “as an
                            acceptable substitute” to getting what we want during the
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <p>The Department clearly does not see a trade negotiation as a substitute
                            for appropriate action to protect our interests during the accession
                            negotiation. But in the last analysis only by lowering the Community’s
                            barriers through reciprocal action will we reduce the incidence of
                            discrimination which is inherent and inevitable in a customs union.
                            Perhaps more important, the Department’s study points out that the
                            Community will be engaged for the better part of the decade in the
                            complex task of digesting the new members while moving towards an
                            economic and monetary union. A major negotiation will be useful in
                            maintaining the outward looking orientation of the Community and to
                            cement the Alliance in the economic field. We are aware that this
                            decision will be made only after the President’s Commission on Trade and
                            Investment makes its report. However, we should be gearing up now for
                            such an effort by developing viable negotiating approaches on <gloss
                                target="#t_NTB1">NTB</gloss>s including preferential government

                            the issues between the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> neutrals are clarified, and we have
                            suggested such a response to queries that holds open all our options. We
                            do not want to adopt positions that tend to force the neutrals and the

                            of the neutrals, which might undermine the political development of the
                            community. Furthermore, we must take into account the peculiar problems

                            of June 8 suggests that we proceed with the three points outlined by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GCJ1">Gilbert</persName> while setting
                            aside the issue of the basic inequity of <gloss target="#t_GATT1"

                                <persName corresp="#p_MCPW1">McCracken</persName>’s June 8
                                memorandum summarized the results of a June 5 meeting, where
                                agreement was reached on how to proceed at the July <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> meeting. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GCJ1">Gilbert</persName> outlined three points:
                                “opposition to adjustments for taxes occultes; a requirement for
                                confrontation and justification in the event of changes in a
                                country’s tax system involving border adjustments, and international
                                control or surveillance of ‘averaging.’” <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                    >GATT</gloss> rules allowed Contracting Parties to levy border
                                taxes, sometimes known as border tax adjustments, imposing domestic,
                                indirect taxes (i.e., excise, value added, and turnover taxes) on
                                imports and rebating and/or excusing such taxes on their exports. A
                                number of European nations and Japan, which relied heavily on
                                indirect taxes (such as value added and turnover taxes), imposed
                                significant border taxes, whereas the United States, which relied
                                primarily on direct taxes (particularly income and property taxes),
                                had only very limited scope for making border tax adjustments. In
                                many circles this was viewed as discrimination against U.S. exports
                                and subsidization of imports into the United States, contributing
                                significantly to the U.S. balance-of-payments deficit. A number of
                                papers regarding border taxes are in the <persName corresp="#p_VPA1"

                                discussed in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Working Party
                                on Border Tax Adjustments. Documentation is in the National

                                1970-72, FN 16 <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>.</note> I do
                            not believe that approach would relieve either our economic or political
                            difficulties. Of the three points proposed by Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_GCJ1">Gilbert</persName>, two are clearly of minimal
                            importance and solutions would result in no substantial trade benefits
                            for U.S. producers. The third faces us with the same basic issue of
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> inequity which Chairman
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCPW1">McCracken</persName> suggests we set
                            aside. Any substantive proposal on changes would require an amendment of
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> provisions concerning the
                            amount of allowable adjustments.</p>

                        <p>The U.S. has talked about taxe occulte<note n="3" xml:id="d41fn3">The
                                taxe occulte is the “hidden” amount of tax that accrues in the value
                                of a product, depending on the number of transactions that occur
                                during a product’s production and distribution. Unlike value added
                                taxes where the rate of application is generally clear, when taxe
                                occulte occurs the effective rate is difficult to gauge, giving rise
                                to the question of what is the appropriate, “average” rate for
                                border tax purposes. See Border Tax Adjustments and Tax Structures
                                in <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Member Countries (Paris:
                                Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 1968), pp.
                                20-21 and 58-63.</note> and averaging primarily for tactical
                            purposes—keeping the talks alive while we consider the basic issue. The
                            problems of averaging and border adjustments for taxe occulte have
                            largely passed us by as they do not inherently exist in the value added
                            tax system. As Italy and Belgium will be adopting the TVA within 18
                            months, only Spain and Austria, among the developed nations, will be
                            left with cascade tax systems<note n="4" xml:id="d41fn4">The cascade
                                tax, or the turnover tax, was used in several European countries.
                                Community members were expected to replace their cascade taxes with
                                value added taxes.</note>—the area of most abuse regarding averaging
                            and taxe occulte. A modification of taxe occulte procedures would limit
                            possible U.S. action while leaving Europeans free to obtain benefits
                            equivalent to adjustment for taxe occulte by simple modifications of
                            their TVA systems. It is clear that there is little economic or
                            political advantage in pursuing a change regarding these points.</p>
                        <p>As for the third point, I agree that countries should not be allowed
                            unilaterally to disrupt the international trading mechanism by changes
                            in their border adjustments.</p>
                        <p>Border tax adjustments will continue to be a problem as <gloss
                                target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> tax harmonization proceeds. Eventually
                            all of Western Europe will be using the TVA and making substantial
                            changes in their border adjustments. These changes, condoned by the bias
                            in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> rules, will have serious
                            disruptive effects on both trade and international balance of payments
                            adjustments. Failure to resist this undercutting of our economic
                            strength will badly damage our ability to prevent other similar
                            actions.</p>
                        <p>In order to argue that changes should be controlled, we must demonstrate
                            that they have trade effects. But in most instances this is true only if
                            direct taxes are, in part or in whole, passed forward to the consumer
                            and/or indirect taxes are partially absorbed by the producer. Either
                            position directly contradicts <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                            rules and confronts us with the issue of amending them to correct the
                            bias in favor of indirect tax systems. Unless the rules are amended,
                            countries would argue that their actions are in conformity with <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and they have no responsibility to
                            offset any trade effects of changes in adjustments.</p>
                        <p>Thus advocacy by the U.S. of proposals covering the points raised by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GCJ1">Gilbert</persName> would seem to
                            make sense only as part of a <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0132"
                            />package which includes a major change in how nations handle border
                            adjustments for taxes.</p>
                        <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MCPW1">McCracken</persName>’s thesis that
                            past changes in tax adjustments at the border are washed out by exchange
                            rate changes disturbs me.<note n="5" xml:id="d41fn5">
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCPW1">McCracken</persName> argued that if a
                                country made a 10 percent border tax adjustment for, say, a value
                                added tax, by rebating that amount on exports and levying that
                                amount on imports, any trade impact of that adjustment would be
                                offset by a corresponding 10 percent appreciation in that country’s
                                currency, which would render its exports 10 percent more expensive
                                in foreign currencies and its imports 10 percent more expensive in
                                domestic currency.</note> It seems to me wrong in implying an
                            equilibrium that simply does not exist and cannot practicably be
                            obtained.</p>
                        <p>We have all recognized the absolute necessity of attaining a stronger
                            goods and services position. The present bias in the border tax
                            adjustment rules complicates the achievement of this goal.</p>
                        <p>The plain fact is that exchange rate changes of the last 10 or 15 years
                            have not and will not eliminate the problem of existing border tax
                            adjustments: our trade balance and balance of payments structure have
                            deteriorated in recent years. The fact that some exchange rate changes
                            might have been different without the border adjustments, if true,
                            provides no answer to the U.S. structural problem. Furthermore, numerous
                            changes in border adjustments have occurred which were not offset even
                            partially by exchange adjustments. Thus, Belgium and Italy have not
                            modified their exchange rates since 1949, the Dutch since 1961, and most
                            of Scandinavia since the immediate post World War II period. Changes in
                            taxes and border adjustments have occurred regularly, with rates and
                            product coverage generally increasing. It is only with respect to the
                            1960 and 1968 German revaluation and the 1961 Dutch revaluation that we
                            can conceivably say that exchange rate change even went in the right
                            direction in order to offset in part the trade effects of the border
                            adjustment. But even in those cases, it cannot be definitively stated
                            that the trade effects of cumulative border tax adjustments were
                            effectively offset. It seems to me fruitless to argue that remaining
                            disequilibria can simply be offset by further exchange rate changes that
                            in practice are both unlikely in the degree necessary and deeply
                            disturbing to the international monetary climate.</p>
                        <p>Carried to its logical conclusion, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MCPW1"
                                >McCracken</persName>’s argument implies that the U.S. need not
                            worry about the level of existing U.S. and foreign tariffs, U.S. and
                            foreign subsidies or most U.S. and foreign import barriers as changes in
                            exchange rates have eliminated their economic impact on U.S. and foreign
                            trade interests. If this were so, the trade message submitted by the
                            President need not have called for tariff reducing authority nor
                            provided for retaliatory authority against foreign subsidies in third
                            country markets. Although exchange rate <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105"
                                facs="0133"/>changes may conceivably eliminate balance of payments
                            disequilibrium, in the sense of reserve losses and gains, we must always
                            question whether the process of adjustment is desirable, the new
                            equilibrium is appropriate for the world and for the U.S., and the
                            resulting payment structure and resource allocation are truly efficient.
                            A new equilibrium with the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> in a heavy
                            trade surplus and the U.S. relying on capital inflows would be
                            structurally unsatisfactory for the U.S. and for the entire world.</p>
                        <p>On a political level, I also do not believe that an argument that
                            exchange adjustments have eliminated the impact of old border
                            adjustments will be persuasive. Certainly these exchange adjustments do
                            not eliminate our countervailing duty problems as the border adjustments
                            continue to exist. In this regard I would point to recent statements by
                            Congressman Mills that he intends to amend the countervailing duty law
                            to require action against all rebates of taxes.</p>
                        <p>As I mentioned before, any effective mechanism for controlling changes in
                            border adjustments must have as its basis the same arguments already put
                            forward on the amount of adjustment for direct and indirect taxes. To
                            achieve an effective control limiting a country’s ability to make such
                            adjustments or changes in them would require a basic amendment to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> rules. By limiting our
                            substantive proposals to controlling changes in adjustments we do not
                            reduce the need for achieving a structural change in <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. We would, however, have thrown out
                            one of our basic arguments, receiving nothing in exchange, and
                            prejudicing our credibility on other U.S. initiatives.</p>

                                    particularly sensitive. Accordingly, the U.S. expects the

                                    soybeans to be extended to the enlarged Community, and the grain
                                    prices for the enlarged Community to be reduced by $15 per ton
                                    from present <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> levels.</item>

                        <p>It is clear that the European Community’s Common Agricultural Policy is
                            already seriously curbing agricultural exports from the United States
                            and the rest of the world. U.S. exports to the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss> subject to variable import levies have declined 47
                            percent since 1967. This decline is largely attributable to the
                            Community’s protective system. On grains, for example, the Community’s
                            high support prices, variable import levies and export subsidies have
                            reduced Community net imports from 12 million tons to less than 4
                            million tons in the last three years. If this system is extended
                            unchanged to an enlarged Community, further U.S. agricultural trade
                            losses will be heavy as a result of curtailed market opportunities in
                            Europe and subsidized European competition elsewhere. Losses will be in
                            such critical commodities as grains, fruits, and tobacco. We suggest
                            that the Committee meet within the next week to take decisions on the
                            matters set out above.<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">Under Secretary of

                                        <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> thought the

                                scheduled for mid-October in Washington and we will confirm precise
                                dates shortly. The Under Secretaries Committee agreed to this
                                procedure. It was also noted that to ensure maximum continuity it
                                would be desirable, insofar as possible, for the same people on both
                                sides to participate in each of these meetings.</item>

                                    were made on it at the meeting. Several agencies took the view

                                    and may be drawn upon to express US policy. Specifically the
                                    view was expressed that the policy of favoring broadening and
                                    strengthening the community has now been watered down to
                                    favoring only “expansion” of the membership of the Community. An
                                    inter-agency working group was instructed to develop further the
                                    substance of the initial communication of US interests to the
                                    Community.</p>
                                <p>As to the form of notification to the Commission, there was
                                    agreement that it should take place at an early date, probably
                                    at the first US-<gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> consultation
                                    in October. Communication would also be made to national
                                    governments through our embassies. There was discussion of the
                                    pros and cons as to whether the communication should be oral or
                                    written, but it was decided to wait until the substance was
                                    agreed before deciding this point.</p>

                            a deep-seated and widespread hostility toward the Community in several
                            agencies of the Executive Branch. Political considerations are brushed
                            aside as largely irrelevant, and attention is focused on short-term
                            economic considerations in a manner out of proportion to our long-term
                            interests. It would be desirable for US policy toward the Community to
                            be made unmistakably clear to the heads of all the Executive Agencies,
                            with the directive that this be conveyed clearly to their staffs.</p>

                            subject in August [see <ref target="#d43">Document 43</ref>], State was
                            subjected to a crossfire of criticism from these agencies and received
                            no offsetting support. This time we have alerted the <gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">Hartman</persName> went on to say that
                            Agriculture would likely be the most difficult issue in the

                            cautioned that “the important thing from our point of view is that such

                                >Dahrendorf</persName> was particularly concerned about the Mills
                            bill, U.S. “unpredictability,” and a perception that the United States
                            was turning inward. (Ibid., <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>

                            According to the October 19 memorandum of the October 15 conversation,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> assured <persName

                            in favor of free trade. Textiles were the lone exception, based on the
                            President’s campaign commitment to that industry. If the textile issue
                            could be resolved through negotiations, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> was confident that the threat of trade

                                >Bergsten</persName> noted that he agreed with <persName

                            legislation “for this year,” but cautioned that the problem was longer

                            initiatives to help hold protectionism “at bay.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCF1">Bergsten</persName> concluded that the <persName

                            procedural standpoint, and the consultative mechanism has been well
                            launched.” He cautioned, however, that “our major trade problems with
                            the Community are not politically susceptible to resolution satisfactory
                            to the United States, and I envisage increasing difficulty in overall
                            U.S.-European relations as a result.” (Ibid.)</p>

                        <p>Following negotiation of the 2-year offset agreement with Germany on July
                            9, 1969 (see <ref target="#d24">Document 24</ref>), U.S. and German
                            officials began to explore the prospect of German willingness to
                            consider budgetary support to help defray foreign exchange costs of U.S.
                            troops in Germany for the next offset beginning in July 1971. Deputy
                            Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SND1">Samuels</persName> and
                            Ambassador Pauls, for instance, discussed this possibility on January
                            29, 1970. (Evening Report from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"

                            Moreover, the Under Secretaries’ Committee recommended that during
                            Chancellor Willi Brandt’s visit to Washington in early April 1970, the
                            President should discuss with him in general terms “the question of
                            seeking new methods, including budget support, to reduce the financial
                            burden resulting from the stationing of U.S. forces abroad.” The
                            Committee recognized that the issue was not an easy one for <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> who might find it difficult to
                            sell budgetary support for U.S. troops to the German people,
                            particularly when the United States might not be prepared to offer the
                            Germans the kind of troop support they would undoubtedly want in return
                            The Under Secretaries’ Committee attached to its recommendations its
                            five-part study (with 11 appendices), “Foreign Exchange Offset and
                            Budget Support for U.S. Forces in Germany and Other NATO Countries,”
                            which presented various options for the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> decided, however,
                            “to defer a judgment at this time on whether the U.S. should seek budget
                            support from Germany in the next offset arrangement, beginning in July
                            1971.” Although he wanted U.S. officials during the <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> visit to indicate to their
                            German counterparts in a general way “the desirability of improving the
                            methods of easing the financial burden to the U.S. of maintaining our
                            troops in Germany,” he did not want them to raise the specific issue of
                            budget support. If the Germans raised it, the U.S. officials could
                            respond that they would certainly “consider it as one possible means of
                            achieving improved methods for easing the U.S. financial problem.”

                            burden-sharing would be small. He stressed that any German contribution
                            would have to be in a multilateral framework. (Telegram 11830 from Bonn,

                                pp. 782-783 and 804-809.</note> Numerous classified cables and press
                            reports suggest that we are dropping the broad “burden sharing” concept.
                            Since a satisfactory “burden sharing” arrangement with our NATO Allies
                            would help us and the Alliance politically, militarily, and financially,
                            I believe we should continue to press for a satisfactory solution.</p>
                        <p>In my view the domestic political situation, particularly on the Hill,
                            concerning reductions in our NATO forces is serious. This political
                            problem is intimately tied to our critical budgetary and balance of
                            payments condition. At the same time we must be careful that our
                            relations with our European Allies are not upset by any precipitous
                            action either by ourselves or by the Congress. With a proper “burden
                            sharing” mix all of these problems can be met or at least blunted for a
                            sufficient period of time to enable us to adjust to new conditions.
                            There have been a number of discussions by myself personally and my
                            staff with counterparts from our NATO Allies. It must be recognized <pb

                                unprecedented.<note n="3" xml:id="d46fn3">See <ref target="#d45"

                            accrue to us it has increased the unity and thereby the strength of our
                            Alliance. This in itself has made the preliminary efforts
                            worthwhile.</p>
                        <p>The “burden sharing” mix mentioned above in my opinion is important to
                            consider, for no one element of “burden sharing” will provide the
                            complete solution to our political, military, or financial problems. We
                            have looked at this problem carefully and believe that an appropriate
                            mix would consist of some direct budgetary contribution on a
                            multilateral basis to the U.S.; an offset agreement between the U.S. and
                            the Federal Republic of Germany; a transfer of certain military
                            functions from the U.S. to our NATO Allies; and an improvement and
                            modernization of our Allies’ national forces.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. should also consider for both tactical and substantive reasons a
                            small reduction in our own forces committed to NATO. The Europeans have
                            consistently stated that they are concerned that we do not make
                            “substantial” reductions. A small reduction would be proof to our Allies
                            that we are truly having problems and that their “burden sharing “
                            effort was warranted as the reduction would have been much greater if
                            they had not been forthcoming. Further, I detect a continuing tendency
                            on the part of some of our Allies not to believe that we are having
                            serious difficulties and that we therefore will not take any action. A
                            small reduction would reinforce our verbal statements that they must do
                            more for themselves in addition to helping our budgetary and political
                            problems with the Congress.</p>
                        <p>In some of the internal cables recently sent on this subject and
                            discussions which have been held within the Executive Branch a
                            particular fallacy has developed. There are those who argue that we urge
                            the Europeans to come up with additional funds with which they either
                            improve their own forces or contribute to the U.S. In my opinion these
                            cannot be equated. The Europeans have consistently made it quite clear
                            that if they come up with additional funds, particularly in the short
                            term, it will be because of the help they can provide the U.S. There is
                            no indication that they plan significantly to increase their own defense
                            budgets in order materially to improve their own national forces. Aside
                            from difference of opinion as to the military need, if the European
                            governments were to increase spending on their own forces, that would
                            tend to be inflationary for them to the extent that they spent the money
                            in their own country. This is an important reason why they are unlikely
                            to do it.</p>
                        <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0143"/>
                        <p>Further, the argument being raised by some that we would be considered
                            mercenaries has no validity. All we are asking in direct budgetary
                            contributions is that the Europeans pay some share of the cost of local
                            supplies and services. The U.S. forces would continue to be paid by us
                            in their entirety.</p>
                        <p>We have an opportunity to improve the Alliance as well as helping to
                            solve some of our problems. A well-planned negotiating effort with our
                            Allies concerning “burden sharing” around the framework mentioned above
                            will materially help. I must, however, say that the cables issued
                            subsequent to your statements and discussed particularly with the
                            Germans will make the task more difficult. An immediate clarification
                            along the lines of the draft cable prepared by <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR2">Mel Laird</persName> and discussed with you would
                            immeasurably help to rectify the situation.<note n="4" xml:id="d46fn4"
                                >The draft cable was not found.</note> I therefore urge that we take
                            this step and start a dialogue as requested by the EURO group minute as
                            soon as possible.</p>

                        <p>State has forwarded a summary of the recent consultations between the
                            U.S. and the European Community (Tab A), the first in a series which
                            will probably represent a new stage in our relations with the Community.
                            We hope that the consultations will defuse, and perhaps <pb n="116"

                            contentious issues that will increasingly be arising between us.</p>
                        <p>This first meeting was carried out with unusual procedural smoothness.
                            Substantively, there was less harmony. The discussions concentrated on
                            four main topics: <list>

                                    representatives avoided threats, but made clear that they would
                                    probably have to react on the trade and investment fronts in
                                    response to shoe quotas and the excessive relaxation of the
                                    escape clause contained in the House trade bill. If the U.S.
                                    avoids enactment of protectionist legislation, however, the
                                    Community has offered to assist in a voluntary U.S.-Japanese
                                    textile agreement by not raising its own barriers to protect

                                    hence increased imports) was out of the question, but that
                                    perhaps it could avoid exacerbating the problem through new

                                <persName corresp="#p_DRG1">Dahrendorf</persName> expressed the fear
                                that the Trade Bill could lead to an escalation of protective
                                measures throughout the world that could seriously disrupt the
                                international exchange of goods and capital. Although careful to
                                avoid threats and explicitly saying that the Community does not
                                intend to make threats, he said it would be unwise for us to think
                                that the European Community would be unable to take common action in
                                response to grave injury to the economic interests of its member
                                states resulting from the Trade Bill.<gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                    >EC</gloss> officials also made clear that American
                                protectionist measures would strengthen the hand of those seeking to
                                discriminate against European subsidiaries of American firms.</p>
                            <p>The Community would be directly and importantly affected by quotas on
                                shoes, <persName corresp="#p_DRG1">Dahrendorf</persName> said, and
                                would most certainly react. But it is the modification of the escape
                                clause, including the trigger mechanism in the Trade Bill, which is
                                most troublesome because it has the potential to change the total
                                complexion of world trade. The Community also objected to the
                                Domestic International Sales Corporation as being an export subsidy
                                in violation of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>.</p>

                                effects of enlargement on third countries and made clear that we
                                regard this bilateral consultative forum as appropriate for raising

                                reduce grain support prices. This would have an important beneficial
                                effect on our exports and reduce the adverse effects of extending
                                the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> agricultural policy to the UK
                                and other applicants. The <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>
                                delegation explained that the Commission is resisting political
                                pressures for an increase in grain prices in the Community but
                                insisted that a reduction in grain prices was politically out of the
                                question. The most that could be hoped for was to continue to keep
                                the grain price stable for several more years. At the current levels
                                of inflation in Europe, stable prices would erode the real return to
                                farmers and thus their stimulus to production, while bringing an
                                improvement to the U.S. exporter in terms of real prices. It was
                                agreed to hold subsequent policy-level discussions between the US

                                arrangements on political grounds and pointed out that these
                                arrangements are for the time being the only instrument available to
                                the Common Market to meet its responsibility to the Mediterranean
                                littoral. He claimed the Common Market did not seek the arrangements
                                for commercial advantage, and he insisted that they caused no
                                commercial injury to the US or other third countries. The US side
                                contested this by pointing out that the California-Arizona citrus
                                industry has already complained of injury. It was agreed that
                                without derogation from or compromising the question of principle,
                                the US and the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> would jointly try

                        </p>
                        <p>I take no stand on whether our overseas troop levels are correct. I do
                            take the firmest possible stand that we should never reduce them for
                            balance of payments reasons.</p>
                        <p>The last Administration had a major hangup over the balance of payments.
                            It did everything from implementing mandatory capital controls, to
                            proposing a tax on foreign travel by American citizens, to requiring the
                            Defense Department to pay 50% higher prices to purchase U.S.
                            commodities, to bringing down Erhard over the offset issue, to the
                            additionality requirements on foreign aid. Even it, however, never
                            reduced U.S. troops abroad for balance of payments reasons—though it
                            considered the possibility repeatedly throughout its eight-year
                            life.</p>
                        <p>The arithmetic demonstrates why. It is true that our foreign expenditures
                            for military purposes are high. However, drastic reductions in our
                            military capabilities would be required to produce small net gains for
                            our balance of payments. When our deficit is running in the $3-$5
                            billion range, as it has for twelve years with temporary aberrations on
                            either side of the range, the saving of a few hundred million dollars
                            gets lost in the shuffle—and even a saving of that relatively small
                            magnitude would require major shifts in troop deployments.</p>
                        <p>In view of the difficult decisions already made to maintain our troop
                            levels in Europe, Vietnamize as rapidly as possible, and pull out of
                            Korea at a pace which already causes major foreign policy problems, I do
                            not see how we could seriously consider additional withdrawals for
                            balance of payments reasons.</p>
                        <p>What would be the signal to the Soviets if we were to do so? It could
                            only be that the U.S. had become so pitifully weak on the economic <pb
                                n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0148"/>and financial front that we
                            could no longer make any pretense of maintaining our defense posture
                            around the world.</p>
                        <p>It is bad enough to make overseas troop decisions on budgetary grounds,
                            but this at least involves real resources and alternative uses of money.
                            To do so for balance of payments reasons, in order to juggle the
                            statistics marginally and enable us to tell the European financial
                            officials “that we are doing something about our problem”, would be
                            criminal.</p>
                        <p>The underlying problem, as always, is the failure to properly perceive
                            our balance of payments situation—and I deliberately do not say “balance

                            Chairman of the Under Secretaries’ Committee. In his memorandum
                                <persName corresp="#p_SND1">Samuels</persName> made the following
                            recommendations concerning the German offset negotiations: <list>
                                <item>“1. The Under Secretaries Committee recommends that you
                                    authorize the negotiation of a new two-year offset agreement
                                    with the Federal Republic of Germany covering the period July 1,
                                    1971 through June 30, 1973.</item>
                                <item>“2. The Committee recommends that, as an initial negotiation
                                    position, we seek both maximum quantity ($850 million) and best
                                    quality of components in an agreement. Such an offset agreement,
                                    together with the recently agreed European Defense Improvement
                                    Program (<gloss target="#t_EDIP1">EDIP</gloss>) would then yield
                                    a total burden-sharing package of $1.0-1.1 billion
                                    annually.</item>
                                <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0150"/>
                                <item>“3. The Committee recommends that the U.S. negotiators be
                                    authorized if necessary in the course of the negotiations to
                                    reduce the quantity goal to achieve better quality. This could
                                    involve a fallback to about $700 million in terms of order of
                                    magnitude.</item>
                                <item>“4. It is recommended that, to the extent possible, offset
                                    negotiating efforts be directed principally to maximizing those
                                    offset components which best contribute to improving German and
                                    allied conventional defense capability, preferably through
                                    direct military procurement and, possibly, by German
                                    underwriting of certain Military Assistance Programs now
                                    financed by the United States and German assumption of certain
                                    costs now borne by the United States in Germany. These are
                                    high-quality components. Other components, such as civilian
                                    procurement, loans and sales of Eximbank paper, would be
                                    assigned lower negotiating priorities.</item>
                                <item>“5. Finally, the Under Secretaries Committee recommends your
                                    approval of the proposed negotiating scenario outlined in the

                            State paper summarizing these talks noted in part: “As at the first
                            round of talks in Bonn, the atmosphere was very good. However, the
                            German position had advanced very little and at the conclusion the two

                            rejected. <persName corresp="#p_JE2">Johnston</persName> pointed out the
                            severe split among the State, Treasury, and Defense Departments on the
                            U.S. position for the upcoming Bonn discussions, the shortness of time,
                            and the uncertainty over whether the Germans were prepared to compromise
                            further. He recommended that U.S. negotiators continue to press the
                            Germans strongly but that no U.S. decision on what to accept be made

                            memorandum summarizing the views of our principal ambassadors on
                            European and Japanese attitudes toward the U.S. economic situation (Tab

                        </p>
                        <p>The Europeans are, of course, very sensitive to the health of the
                            American economy since it greatly influences their own situation. Most
                            of them express strong recognition of a need for a resumption of U.S.
                            economic growth—even the French, who because of their monetary and
                            nationalistic investment concerns, have not generally felt this way in
                            the past. There is great worry, particularly in financial circles, about
                            the other side of the balance—the possibility of a resumed U.S.
                            inflation—but the greater stress by officials with broader concerns is
                            clearly on the need for an up-turn in the American economy.</p>
                        <p>U.S. inflation or an immoderate resumption of U.S. growth are most
                            worrisome for their international monetary implications, and their
                            exacerbating European domestic inflation. Many worry, for example, that
                            a <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0152"/>continued rapid lowering of
                            U.S. interest rates will cause a massive flow of funds to Europe,
                            weakening the international monetary system and their own efforts to
                            restrain inflation. The Europeans are disturbed that our colossal
                            monetary importance, combined with the inflexibility of international
                            exchange rates, drags their interest rates behind ours and vitiates the
                            effect of their monetary measures on their domestic economies or on
                            their balance of payments.<note n="3" xml:id="d51fn3">The President drew

                            of payments, we have already increased the Export-Import Bank’s
                            borrowing abroad and reduced the margin requirements which were to some
                            extent pushing U.S. banks to disgorge their previous foreign

                        <p>Consequently, the foreigners tend to favor U.S. use of fiscal measures
                            rather than monetary measures as medicine for our current problems. They
                            disagree on the domestic effectiveness of incomes policies, and are
                            therefore ambivalent about how the United States should use such
                            measures. However, they do seem to favor some use of strict Federal
                            Government power to help slow wage and price increases. State did not
                            quiz the ambassadors on U.S. trade policy, but most ambassadors made a
                            strong point about foreign concern over the direction these policies
                            have been taking. Part of their interest in resumed U.S. economic growth
                            stems from the belief that U.S. protectionism has gathered force from
                            our economic slowdown.</p>

                            Representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which he did

                            continued to serve as Ambassador at Large for Foreign Economic Policy

                        <p>On December 2, 1971, Kennedy, who was in London, sent a back channel

                                >Kennedy</persName> recommended, among other things, that the

                        <p>Some have argued that the costs are such as to suggest relaxation of the
                            programs despite the presumed result. This point of view highlights the

                            argument is irrelevant and, in view of the undoubted costs, the programs
                            should be abandoned. Material presented in the attached memorandum leads

                            <p>The President has pledged himself to “bring an end to self-defeating
                                controls on investment at the earliest possible time.”</p>
                            <p>This memorandum reviews the reasons why I believe it is timely to
                                redeem the President’s pledge.</p>
                            <p rend="center">Estimates of Effectiveness of Individual Programs</p>
                            <p>The balance of payments is not necessarily determined by trade and
                                capital flows in the direct and predictable way which casual
                                reasoning suggests.</p>
                            <p>As a result of the format in which the accounts are conventionally
                                arranged, the flow of reserves happens to be the last item listed in
                                the international financial accounts. The assumption that this
                                residual account will be the one to absorb the impact whenever there
                                is a change in some other account is unwarranted. It is equally
                                plausible that one of the other accounts will respond.</p>
                            <p>For example, it is by no means clear that a reduction in the outflow
                                of U.S.-owned capital will have any effect on the flow of reserves.
                                A priori, any number of accounts could absorb the change. In
                                particular, economic reasoning suggests that the closest substitute
                                category (foreign capital flows) will take up the slack. To the
                                extent that capital from one source is a close substitute for
                                capital from another, the reduction in U.S. capital outflows should
                                be offset by an equal reduction in foreign capital inflows. There is
                                no reason to expect that capital controls would, in any significant
                                sense, actually reduce the net outflow of reserves.</p>
                            <p>Compliance with the administrative regulations under the control
                                program appears to have been satisfactory. However, the Office of
                                Foreign Direct Investment believes that the longer the controls are
                                in effect, and as costs of compliance to U.S. business rise,
                                compliance problems will grow more serious. In any case, nominal
                                compliance with regulations is not the major test of effectiveness
                                of the programs. Effectiveness is best measured by: <list>

                                movements in controlled and uncontrolled capital flows before and
                                after the inception of the <gloss target="#t_IET1">IET</gloss>. He
                                found that net purchases of taxable securities fell by $500 million
                                between the half year just preceding proposal of the tax and a year
                                later. This effect was completely offset by increases in U.S. direct
                                investment, long-term lending by banks, and short-term lending by
                                banks and others. As it happened, the U.S. balance of payments
                                hardly improved despite a $2.7 billion increase in the surplus on
                                goods and services. <persName corresp="#p_CRN1">Cooper</persName>

                                    Capital Movements and the Voluntary Foreign Credit Restraint
                                    Program,” unpublished paper, University of Chicago, 1969.
                                    [Footnote in the source text.]</note> developed two empirical
                                relationships relating capital flows to economic variables using
                                monthly statistics prior to the inception of the VFCRP. Under test,
                                these two relationships proved to be accurate predictors of both
                                private U.S. short-term capital outflows and foreign private
                                short-term capital inflows.</p>
                            <p>Based on data for the sixteen months following the inception of the
                                VFCRP, the same relationships were then used to estimate the effects
                                of the program on short-term capital flows.</p>
                            <p>The graph below displays the cumulative balance-of-payments effects
                                reported by Laffer. According to the graph, outflows of U.S. private
                                short-term capital were definitely retarded. These favorable
                                balance-of-payments effects were, however, by early 1966, almost
                                precisely offset by compensating unfavorable movements in private
                                foreign short-term capital flows.</p>
                            <p>[Omitted here is the graph illustrating the conclusion.]</p>
                            <p>This led Laffer to conclude that: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>… The net effects of the VFCRP on the U.S. balance of
                                        payments seem to be quite negligible. In fact, for a long
                                        time, the VFCRP appears to have cost the United States in
                                        terms of foreign exchange, and only after a year or more in
                                        operation were the net effects on the U.S. official
                                        settlements balance of payments non-negative. Therefore, the
                                        ostensible success of this program with respect to U.S.
                                        capital flows appears to have been negated by foreign
                                        capital flows.</p>

                                    <p>The available statistics regarding the OFDI program … cast
                                        doubt on the extent to which the program actually restricts
                                        direct foreign investment today. The figures set forth show
                                        that U.S. firms have never invested the full amount
                                        permitted by OFDI quota….</p>
                                    <p>Of course, not all of these allowables can be utilized by
                                        individual firms. However, even after taking this wastage
                                        into account, it is clear that generous investment
                                        allowables are available in most cases to U.S. firms wishing
                                        to expand their investments abroad….</p>
                                    <p>These facts naturally raise questions as to why we need a
                                        direct investment control program, costing about $3 million
                                        per year to administer, plus much larger amounts in
                                        compliance costs incurred by the firms subject to OFDI
                                        controls.</p>

                                    the capital control programs to succeed. When Americans are
                                    inhibited from transmitting capital abroad, it is logical that
                                    foreigners will do the investing in their place. As a
                                    consequence, foreigners will reduce their U.S. investments.
                                    There is no reason to expect that net capital flows (or

                        <p rend="center">I. The Problem</p>
                        <p>The character of our economic relations with Western Europe and Japan
                            have been strained. We are at odds on a variety of problems. Most
                            important, at the moment, are textiles, agriculture and monetary issues.
                            On the horizon are problems of reconciling various national policies
                            which affect the economies of other countries, U.S. investment, and
                            international trade in general. More specifically, some of the most
                            immediate issues facing us are that: <list>
                                <item>—U.S. industry and labor are demanding import restrictions on
                                    a variety of products.</item>
                                <item>—The U.S. farm bloc is concerned over access to the European
                                    Common Market and over prospective losses when Britain
                                    enters.</item>
                                <item>—Despite the economic benefits to the United States of an
                                    enlarged European Community, specific sectors of U.S. industry
                                    may be adversely affected when the British become part of the
                                    Community.</item>
                                <item>—American labor is concerned about jobs presumably lost as the
                                    multinational corporation establishes production abroad.</item>
                                <item>—American industry wants greater access to the Japanese market
                                    for exports and investment.</item>
                                <item>—Foreigners are concerned about the resurgence of
                                    protectionist sentiment in the United States as illustrated by
                                    the Mills bill, voluntary textile, steel and meat restrictions
                                    and quotas for imports of dairy products.</item>
                                <item>—Europeans are concerned about our balance of payments
                                    deficit, particularly stemming from massive flows of short-term
                                    capital, and our attitude toward it.</item>
                                <item>—Foreigners are uneasy about the growing power of the
                                    U.S.-based multinational corporation.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Despite these problems the world economy has been growing rapidly and
                            U.S. international trade and investment are thriving. The fact of our
                            success, however, has produced sharp adjustment problems—domestically
                            and internationally—that require urgent attention.</p>
                        <p>If these problems are not dealt with, the international institutions for
                            economic cooperation, developed in the postwar period and which serve us
                            well, could be threatened.</p>
                        <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0162"/>
                        <p>Even more important, there would be serious political fall-out if world
                            economic cooperation deteriorated. We cannot expect the same cooperation
                            on political and security issues from our major allies in an atmosphere
                            of increasing acrimony over economic issues. Public support at home for
                            our international security policies would be undermined. And, if the
                            economic climate deteriorates sufficiently, the poor countries will have
                            greater difficulty in standing on their own feet.</p>
                        <p>What we need is a framework among the industrialized
                            countries—principally the U.S., the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>,
                            and Japan—to deal with these existing concerns as well as the new
                            developments we will be facing in the years ahead. The industrialized
                            countries need to intensify their economic cooperation in all areas,
                            including a better ordering of trade relationships directed toward more
                            liberal access to markets, and a more smoothly functioning monetary
                            relationship. Such a program can be undertaken only in cooperation with
                            other countries. Acting alone, and on each problem separately,
                            governments are under pressure to find narrow solutions to domestic
                            problems at the expense of foreigners.</p>
                        <p>Such a program will require considerable preparation at home and careful
                            consultation abroad. Until it can be developed, we need an interim
                            program to deal with immediate pressures.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II. An Interim Program</p>
                        <p>An interim program might have four major components: <list>
                                <item>—International action on specific problems, particularly
                                    textiles and certain agricultural products;</item>
                                <item>—international consideration of the agenda and schedule for a
                                    broad economic initiative;</item>
                                <item>—domestic discussion of issues with Congress and the
                                    public;</item>
                                <item>—trade legislation.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>Concerning textiles, we must first deal with the short run problems of
                            imports from Japan and other Asian suppliers through 1973. We should
                            also, however, take up <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Director
                            General Long’s proposal that a multinational consideration of trade
                            problems for all textiles be undertaken before the expiration of the
                            current arrangement on cotton textiles. In the face of increased imports
                            from low wage countries the textile industries in developed countries
                            constitute a strong force against trade liberalization. If Long’s
                            proposal could be acted upon, the textile issue might be isolated.</p>
                        <p>In addition to an effort to settle the textile problem, we should press
                            forward to resolve several highly politicized agricultural problems with
                            the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>—citrus, tobacco, poultry, and
                            lard—and should seek <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0163"/>to avoid
                            an increase in <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> corn prices. We should
                            recognize, however, that the probability of success is small. We have
                            been trying to deal with trade problems one by one for years with no
                            positive results. In this context governments find it difficult
                            politically to stand up to particular interests.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">B. International Consideration of a Broad Economic
                                Initiative</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The possible substance of a broad economic initiative is described in
                            Part III of this memorandum. Such an undertaking will require a period
                            of international consultation, as well as domestic soundings. The
                            prospects for a major initiative can also mitigate domestic concerns and
                            pressures, even though actual negotiations may not begin for some
                            time.</p>
                        <p>We believe it is important, therefore, to initiate international
                            consideration of a comprehensive economic program at the <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Ministerial Meeting in June.</p>
                        <p>The organization is the right one in terms of membership. June is the
                            time when the UK entry negotiations will be reaching a crunch and public
                            interest and concern in this country are expected to be
                            considerable.</p>
                        <p>No binding commitment to international negotiations can be expected
                            before the basic decision on UK entry is made. However, such a
                            commitment must be prepared by a careful process of international
                            consultation and discussion in the media.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Ministerial Meeting would lay
                            out the need for an international economic action program for the
                            1970’s, and appoint a special group to prepare the guidelines for such a
                            program. This group should consist of high-level government
                            representatives of the U.S., the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>, the
                            UK, Japan, and Canada. Such a group would begin serious work in the fall
                            of 1971 and outline the content of such an action program.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>We also need to enter into low-key but extensive consultations with
                            Congress and to make a major effort to raise the level of public
                            consideration of the issues at home. We must show how much we have
                            gained from an open, integrated world economy, what we risk by standing
                            still, and what we lose by moving backward.</p>
                        <p>While there is no substitute for good policy, such policy cannot grow
                            without public understanding and support. The forthcoming reports of the
                            Williams Commission and the Boggs Congressional Subcommittee could be
                            keystones of a public discussion program. But the enormous prestige and
                            influence of the President will be required to coalesce support for a
                            liberal policy.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The basic question is whether there is any advantage to be gained by
                            seeking interim trade legislation. Our efforts in 1970 to relax the
                            escape clause led to results that would have been disastrous if the
                            Mills Bill had passed. The relaxation of the escape clause in that Bill
                            would have resulted in an enormous amount of new restrictions that would

                            interpretation, has already relaxed the escape clause, and particularly
                            adjustment assistance criteria. It would, of course, be highly desirable
                            to eliminate <gloss target="#t_ASP1">ASP</gloss>, but given the

                        <p>A major international initiative should cover the whole gamut of economic
                            issues of the 70’s, although trade, agriculture, and monetary issues
                            will likely be among the most predominant. The major areas for
                            consideration are: agriculture, non-agricultural trade, foreign
                            investment, international finance and assistance to the developing
                            countries. These are briefly described below.</p>

                        <p>Governments of all countries use a wide range of domestic support
                            programs and trade restrictions to help their farmers. The United States
                            has suffered from agricultural policies of other countries, particularly
                            the Common Market and Japan. We are an efficient agricultural producer.
                            Thus, measures to put agricultural trade on a more liberal basis would
                            be in our interest. We also would have to permit an increase in
                            agricultural imports.</p>

                            in conformity with each other.</p>
                        <p>We will need to consider a formula that would result in both tariff
                            reduction (to satisfy our demands) and tariff harmonization (to satisfy
                            the Community’s demands). We might also consider a virtual phasing out
                            of tariffs in certain sectors or under certain conditions.</p>

                        <p>Foreign governments have a multitude of other trade restrictions. Their
                            significance in potential trade terms varies greatly. We need to

                            headway. Government procurement policies form one such area. Japan, with
                            a multiplicity of controls on imports, and Canada, with various
                            practices to encourage investment at the expense of imports, would be
                            our major targets. The Europeans also have a number of restrictions that
                            should be included in the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Foreign governments will press the U.S. on a number of our own
                            restrictions—including the absence of an injury clause in our

                        <p>Any program will require public and Congressional support. The question
                            of when we ask for legislation and what type of legislation is desirable
                            has to be carefully considered as we progress in our international and
                            domestic consultations.</p>
                        <p>It is particularly important that we keep Congress fully involved in the
                            international discussions. This could be achieved by having
                            Congressional representation on our delegations to various international
                            meetings. Whether we do this or not, frequent and close consultations
                            with Congress is essential.</p>
                        <p>Clearly, we will need legislation at some stage in the game. The
                            questions of what and when cannot be decided until we get a clearer view
                            of what we want and what foreign governments are prepared to do.</p>
                        <p>In any case, legislation probably will be needed to provide authority to
                            reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers, to negotiate about domestic
                            agricultural support programs, and to repeal <gloss target="#t_ASP1"

                        <p>An imaginative new adjustment assistance program is essential if we are
                            to embark on a major trade liberalization initiative, and such a program
                            will also likely require legislation. We have already submitted
                            suggestions to you on the possible form such an adjustment assistance
                            program might take.</p>

                                on Treasury’s responsibilities for the international financial

                                <ref target="#d55">Document 55</ref>.</note> rightly focuses on some
                            key issues before the Administration. We will be sending along some
                            suggestions for the first three items shortly.</p>
                        <p>However, I believe the memorandum raises, by indirection, important
                            organizational issues that need to be resolved. Specifically, paragraph
                            4, which calls for a basic review of our approach to balance of payments
                            and international monetary problems, seems simply to ignore existing
                            responsibilities of the Treasury and present coordinating machinery.</p>
                        <p>I have assumed that the deliberations and responsibilities of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> Group were to be
                            continued—this has been the channel for issues such as those posed in
                            paragraph 4. Obviously, as appropriate, the results of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> Group work could be reviewed at
                            sessions of the Council on International Economic Policy. I do not know
                            whether you contemplate some other procedure; if so, we had better
                            clarify this now.</p>
                        <p>Although not raising the matter directly, your memorandum also brings to
                            mind a second issue—that of the role and function of the National
                            Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies in
                            coordinating, under Congressional mandate, our international lending
                            activity. We have assumed that the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>,
                            too, would maintain its responsibilities and that its functions would
                            not be the subject of any jurisdictional grab by others. As you know,
                            the day to day work in this area for the past twenty-five years has been
                            conducted quietly and efficiently at the staff and Assistant Secretary
                            level.</p>
                        <p>In view of the creation of the <gloss target="#t_CIEP1">CIEP</gloss>, it
                            may be that matters referred by the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                            Alternates to the Principals in the past would, hereafter, go to the
                            Council. I would be prepared to function on that basis.</p>

                        <p>I understand you should soon have on your desk for decision matters
                            relating to the organization of the Administration for foreign economic
                            policy, filling out the framework established by the Council for
                            International Economic Policy. I believe it is important that this
                            matter be cleared up promptly. It is even more important that the
                            arrangements be effective, workable, and consistent with operating
                            responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>Internationally, my major concern, as Secretary of the Treasury and your
                            chief financial official, must be with international monetary and
                            balance of payments policy. The Treasury Department, by the nature of
                            its statutory responsibilities and role, necessarily carries the
                            principal burden in this area—it is part and parcel of the daily job,
                            and the Congress, the public, and foreign governments properly look to
                            me as the spokesman. That responsibility carries with it a further
                            responsibility to advise you on these matters.</p>
                        <p>Equally clearly, there is a need for coordination and consultation—most
                            closely with the Federal Reserve, but also with State, the Council of
                            Economic Advisers, and others. In practice, throughout your
                            Administration, the principal channel for coordination of international
                            monetary policy has been through the Under Secretary of the Treasury for
                            Monetary Affairs—the so-called “<persName corresp="#p_VPA1"
                                >Volcker</persName> Group,” where all relevant agencies are
                            represented. I have found considerable agreement that this channel has
                            worked effectively, and I assume it will remain in place.</p>
                        <p>Essentially, I believe this Group could and should, under my immediate
                            direction, formally function as a committee of the <gloss

                            matters in this area need to be treated in a more restricted forum than
                            the full Council. Indeed, I am at a loss to see in what other way this
                            area can be handled consistent with my present responsibilities and
                            those of the Department, yet assuring the full Administration

                            of an over-all coordinator for aid, as urged by Rudy Peterson, and the
                            concept of the <gloss target="#t_CIEP1">CIEP</gloss>. I have sent to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">George Shultz</persName> a more detailed
                                memorandum,<note n="3" xml:id="d58fn3">Not found.</note> outlining
                            what seems to me a sensible solution, but also wanted you to have the
                            essence of my thinking directly.</p>
                        <p>Essentially, the new bilateral aid agencies could be coordinated through
                            a <gloss target="#t_CIEP1">CIEP</gloss> subcommittee, chaired either by
                            State, or—to fit the concept of a divorce from short-term foreign
                            policy—by Pete <persName corresp="#p_PPG1">Peterson</persName> or one of
                            his assistants. If one man needs to show the flag in Congress, the
                            Secretary of State would seem to remain the logical choice. However, I
                            would stop well short of any concept of a single coordinating “czar” in
                            this area. Inevitably, that would cut across the <gloss
                                target="#t_CIEP1">CIEP</gloss> arrangements and blur—possibly to the
                            point of extinction—your basic idea of keeping separate the several
                            distinct elements in the foreign assistance program.</p>
                        <p>We already have the National Advisory Council mechanism, with a Treasury
                            Chairman, for the multilateral programs. Among other things, this
                            provides the Congressionally sanctioned vehicle for the Treasury
                            legislative effort in this area, which has been rather successful
                            through the years. I believe the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                            should continue in practice as a parallel committee of the <gloss
                                target="#t_CIEP1">CIEP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The big issues—how much money to allocate to the bilateral and
                            multilateral programs, the basic policy guidelines—are certainly matters
                            for the <gloss target="#t_CIEP1">CIEP</gloss>, itself.</p>

                                <ref target="#d55">Document 55</ref>.</note> the President has
                            directed a basic review of our policy approaches toward the balance of
                            payments and international monetary problems within the framework of the
                            Council on International Economic Policy. He wants this work to proceed
                            on a high priority basis. I have also discussed with the respective
                            heads of your operations the virtue of keeping the initial work group
                            small and restricted, to those with real expertise in the field.</p>
                        <p>I am, therefore, creating an Ad Hoc Group on the subject, comprised of
                            the addressees of this memorandum. The President has also indicated that
                            we should bring in the best people from outside Government to
                            participate in our efforts as they develop.<note n="3" xml:id="d59fn3"

                            assuming, of course, the “<persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>
                            Group” will continue to coordinate the implementation of U.S.
                            international monetary and balance of payments policy. Everything I’ve
                            heard is that this is one of the best interagency groups in the
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>As I see it, we first need to lay out an agenda of the policy issues in
                            this area which need to be discussed. I have discussed monetary problems
                            with a number of people both inside and outside of Government during my
                            six weeks here. I’m simply attaching a preliminary list of what some of
                            those areas are that have come up in some of my discussions.</p>
                        <p>I would hope we could discuss these ideas, and others which you might
                            suggest for our work agenda, at our first meeting on March 31 at 9:00
                            a.m. in my office.<note n="4" xml:id="d59fn4">No record of a meeting has
                                been found.</note> I would also hope we could discuss some ideas on
                            how to go about the work, and what outside inputs we might use.</p>

                                    such a target be formulated? Should our target relate to our
                                    overall balance (on what definition?) or to particular

                                failed “altogether to do justice to the analytical complexity of the
                                questions raised by the [capital controls] program,” and was

                            controls at this time would be interpreted abroad as “malign neglect” of
                            our responsibilities as a key currency country for the stability of our
                            currency and the monetary system and as an overt affront to other
                            countries dealing with what they consider to be highly excessive dollar
                            inflows. Beyond any effort on our part to explain the “ineffectiveness”
                            of the controls, action could not only trigger loss of confidence in the
                            dollar and a major international financial crisis, but, in the eyes of
                            much of the world, cast us in the role of initiating villain. As you
                            know, our official settlements deficit last year, excluding the <gloss
                                target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> allocation, was $10.7 billion. In the
                            first three months of 1971, the rate is, unfortunately, much higher.
                            While we do not expect the deficit to continue at anything like this
                            level, there is grave concern among foreign monetary authorities at the
                            present time.</p>
                        <p>It is important to note that the Congress accepts the need for retaining
                            the controls at present without a murmur and, in fact, insisted upon
                            giving us more authority to apply controls over our objections. The <pb

                            the inadvisability of eliminating the controls, and even directly
                            affected financial houses did not ask for elimination at this time but,
                            rather, accepted the need for continuance.</p>

                                corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> memorandum, I agree basically
                            with the conclusion that we should dismantle the capital controls
                            programs. This should, however, be done progressively and not in one
                            step, for reasons stated in the next paragraph. The controls distort
                            resource allocation and the most efficient development of U.S. and
                            European capital markets, raise the cost of doing business abroad, and
                            give rise to resentments under certain circumstances in foreign
                            countries over the dominating role that U.S. companies play in absorbing
                            capital availabilities in the European capital market. Further, these
                            controls get in the way of attempts to reduce artificial barriers to the
                            flows of capital and resources. Moreover, by now we may have exhausted
                            any short-term balance of payments benefits from the controls, although
                            this conclusion could be debated on a technical level ad infinitum.</p>
                        <p>In stating the above, however, I believe it important that this unwinding
                            should take place in an orderly fashion and take account of the problems
                            involved. For example, in winding down the <gloss target="#t_FDIP1"
                                >FDIP</gloss>, whether we do it through increasing allowables or
                            collapsing schedules or by some other device, we must bear in mind there
                            exists $10.5 billion of outstanding American borrowing abroad which
                            could readily flow into U.S. hands and greatly exacerbate our dollar
                            outflow problem unless the dismantling is handled carefully. Although
                            much of the massive outflow this and last year is a result of the U.S.
                            and European business cycles and interest rate differentials being out
                            of phase with each other and is probably capable of being better
                            stabilized as interest rates change, abandonment of the structure of
                            controls under present circumstances would be viewed as an affirmation
                            of the current widely-held belief abroad that the fundamental U.S.
                            attitude toward the balance of payments is in fact one of “benign
                            neglect.” This would have unfortunate monetary effects, and beyond that
                            would further encourage foreigners to seek ways of insulating themselves
                            from the effects of U.S. economic and monetary policies. I reiterate,
                            therefore, that we should progressively wind down the controls toward
                            elimination, preferably at a substantially accelerated rate over that
                            which has so far prevailed.</p>

                                speculation, whereas earlier movements were primarily in response to
                                differentially high short-term interest rates in Germany. Because of

                                        can be and is being dealt with on its own terms. This
                                        essentially short-term problem will not bring any change in

                            <item>Basic balance of payments positions are not especially strong in
                                Europe. A major part of offsetting surpluses to the U.S. basic
                                deficit will probably be found, though data uncertain, in Canada and
                                Japan. Continental European basic surpluses have been held down by
                                U.S. restraints on long-term capital outflows. Large, current
                                account surplus of Germany was nearly halved in 1970 as compared
                                with 1969, and appears to be weakening somewhat further. Although
                                current account surplus of <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> as a
                                whole remains large, this surplus now roughly balanced by aid and
                                large long-term capital outflows, leaving basic balance in balance.
                                Wage and price movements in Europe now suggest a more rapid pace of
                                inflation relative to the U.S. and Canada and such movements also
                                weigh against upward revaluations of European currencies. United
                                States has exercised restraint on inflationary demand in 1969 and
                                1970 and unemployment has reached levels substantially higher than
                                those experienced in Europe.</item>

                            <item>However, the U.S. basic balance remains unsatisfactory, reflecting
                                serious deterioration in U.S. trade surplus from levels of early
                                1960’s. This deterioration shows up primarily with Japan and Canada,
                                although European agricultural policies present the threat of
                                further deterioration. In addition a primary cause of current
                                difficulties is our continuing large military defense burden
                                including particularly in such surplus areas as Europe and Japan.
                                Despite their surpluses many other developed countries, including
                                both Japan and the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>, still have

                                depressing the U.S. economy. In fact, such action would aggravate
                                net capital outflow. It would also reduce U.S. imports, thus tending
                                to depress the economies of some exporting countries.</item>

                                flows do represent serious problem for several European countries
                                and for international monetary system. U.S. concern with this
                                problem evidenced in President’s report on “U.S. Foreign Policy in
                                the 1970’s” in which he listed objective of cooperation in monetary
                                sphere “to handle large-scale shifts of liquid capital without
                                exchange crises or losses in the ability of individual nations to
                                pursue their monetary policies.” President called for “an intensive
                                examination to determine whether there is need to reinforce the
                                present techniques and procedures of international monetary
                                cooperation to enable us better to cope with such movements.” This
                                problem, though serious, is fundamentally different from the basic
                                balance problem. It results from fact countries in different
                                cyclical situations tend to different interest rate levels and
                                monetary policies must have scope for domestic requirements. In
                                1970-71, this has meant substantial differential between U.S.
                                interest rates which have been relatively low reflecting
                                sluggishness of economy and our need for economic stimulus, and
                                interest rates in certain European countries, which have been high
                                reflecting continuing inflationary boom and desire for continued
                                restraint in those countries. These divergencies in money market
                                conditions are the major source of the massive U.S. official
                                settlements deficit of 1970.</item>

                            need to raise with Pete. You might, however, wish to stress to him your
                            interest in early submission of our generalized tariff preferences
                            legislation in view of the implications for Latin American policy. You

                        <p>There is, however, a deeper and more philosophical point which will

                                >Peterson</persName>: the relationship between foreign economic
                            policy and overall foreign policy. It is roughly accurate to say that
                            foreign economic policy has been the handmaiden of overall U.S. foreign
                            policy throughout the post-war period; all of our great “economic”
                            initiatives (<gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>-<gloss

                            policy reasons, and foreign policy considerations have dictated the U.S.
                            position on virtually all issues of foreign economic policy.</p>
                        <p>There is now great and increasing pressure to change this relationship.
                            In fact, it probably must be changed to some extent—to increase the
                            “economic” content of foreign economic policy—for the same reasons that
                            we are now seeking to share our global role in political and security
                            matters. The creation of Peterson’s job, of course, is an important
                            indicator of this trend, and adds to the pressures for moving in such a
                            direction.</p>
                        <p>However, some go so far as to say that foreign policy should now become
                            the handmaiden of foreign economic policy;<note n="2" xml:id="d64fn2">On

                                    Department. He already despairs at State’s ability to carry out
                                    negotiations with sufficient toughness to get acceptable results
                                    and present a respectable image. He clearly views this as an
                                    institutional problem rather than simply one of present
                                    personalities, though he is fully aware that present
                                    personalities exacerbate the difficulty. He hopefully speaks of
                                    getting an Under Secretary who understands economic issues and
                                    could hold to a tough line on them.</p>
                                <p>“This line of Pete’s thinking raises two problems for you. The
                                    first is the substantive problem I mentioned in my memorandum of
                                    yesterday (Tab B): his growing desire to use overall foreign
                                    policy to pursue economic objectives, which will cause you
                                    increasing problems in the future.</p>
                                <p>“The second is the problem of who does what in this field. I am
                                    more pessimistic than Pete about State. It is my view that their
                                    internal pressures will always cause them to soften in tough
                                    negotiations, whether on economic or other issues. I therefore
                                    suggested that Pete essentially forget about State and
                                    revitalize the Office of the Special Trade Representative by
                                    replacing <persName corresp="#p_GCJ1">Carl Gilbert</persName>
                                    with a tough negotiator who would be both effective and
                                    respected on the Hill. He could operate de facto as Pete’s
                                    deputy and operating arm. I recommend that you promote this line
                                    when you discuss the matter with Pete today.” (National

                            Pete himself believes that a trend in this direction is inevitable.
                            There is certainly wide support for it in the Congress.</p>
                        <p>The obvious answer is that a new balance must be found between the
                            economic and foreign policy components of foreign economic policy. This
                            will often invade the heart of foreign policy, on such issues as German
                            offset, general trade policy and therefore overall relations with key
                            countries such as Japan and the Common Market; specific commodity
                            problems such as meat, textiles, shoes, sugar, etc.; and East-West trade
                            policy, on which the President has asked for a special <gloss

                        <p>The important thing at this point is simply for Pete to know that you are
                            aware of this problem, and the need to work it out with him on
                            essentially a case-by-case basis. I see no general formula, or method
                            for getting one, which can resolve the issue on a broader basis. You
                            should make it clear, of course, that you are not prepared to see
                            economic issues dominate foreign policy in areas where our political
                            interests are sufficiently important.</p>

                            Subsequently, the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Secretary
                            General advanced the proposal for such a group on his own
                            responsibility. While final positions are unlikely to be taken by
                            governments until the meeting, the extensive consultations carried out
                            by State indicate wide interest and substantial support for the proposal

                            unanimity for adoption. The European Community, some members of which
                            have reservations, could still block action, but the French statement
                            that this matter could be worked out by “reasonable men” indicates the
                            likely outcome.<note n="6" xml:id="d65fn6">Not further

                        <p>I do not believe it would be desirable at this late date to oppose
                            formation of the group. To do so might be interpreted both as backing
                            away from an idea we floated and as a stand against positive initiatives
                            at a time when monetary relations are strained. The restricted group
                            would permit us to talk quietly with the European Community, Japan,
                            Canada, and the U.K. about how we will deal with economic problems,

                            is important that we get at this now that British entry seems assured.
                            Finally, I anticipate that the working group would assist in the

                            multilateral negotiation, much as the NATO examination of allied defense
                            strategy proceeded in tandem with examination of the same issues in the

                        <p>At the conclusion of the formal sessions, the German chairman expressed
                            concern that the two sides had not been able to reach agreement. He then
                            informally outlined a “personal” proposal which he said had not been
                            discussed with the Cabinet but which he believed the Cabinet might be
                            persuaded to accept as an “alternate” German offer.</p>
                        <p>The following are the elements of this proposal: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                <p>Budget Support—$314.6 million, of which $228.8 million would be

                                    new German budget funds. Of the total, $228.8 million would be a

                                <p>Bundesbank Loan—$572 million for 4-1/2 years at 2-1/2%
                                    interest.</p>

                        <p>This proposal represents a slight improvement over the official offer.
                            However, from the balance-of-payments point of view, the benefit to the
                            U.S. would average only about $626 million per year (including the
                            loan)—about half our estimated balance-of-payments costs in Germany.
                            Therefore, State, Treasury and Defense prepared a counterproposal which
                            was transmitted to the Germans on July 24.<note n="4" xml:id="d68fn4">A

                        </p>
                        <p>The counterproposal suggests a package comprised of the following on a
                            two-year basis: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Military Procurement—$929.5 million, of which $14 million would
                                    be taken from Treasury Account 1.</p>
                                <p>Budget Support—$686.4 million, to be financed entirely from funds
                                    already on deposit in Treasury Accounts 1 and 2.</p>
                                <p>Bundesbank Loan—$572 million for 4-1/2 years at 2-1/2
                                    interest.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Under the counterproposal, the total of military procurement would remain
                            the same, but the amount of new money required would <pb n="165"
                                xml:id="pg_165" facs="0193"/>be increased by DM 700 million ($200
                            million). The amount of budget support payments would be increased by
                            the use of additional funds from Treasury deposits and Bundesbank
                            credits would remain as proposed informally by Dr.
                                <persName>Herbst</persName>. Treasury Accounts 1 and 2 would be
                            almost entirely exhausted, so that in any subsequent offset agreement
                            new money would be required and have a full balance-of-payments
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>The counterproposal is substantially above either the formal offer or the
                            personal Herbst proposal and there has been nothing in our negotiations
                            thus far to suggest that the Germans might be prepared to improve their
                            offer to this extent, if at all. However, we believe it is desirable to
                            make this additional effort to bring about an improvement in their
                            position.</p>
                        <p>The initial German reaction to our proposal has been very negative.<note

                                “<persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> made it clear from
                            the outset that he wished to run the economic-trade section of the

                            develop the kind of action plan envisaged by Treasury, Commerce, Labor
                            and Agriculture in one of the options.” Much of the discussion dealt
                            with speculation about possibly loosening ties with Japan and the risks
                            inherent in an independent Japan in Asia. At the close of the meeting,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that the next

                            being developed by the <gloss target="#t_CIEP1">CIEP</gloss> as well as

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIEP1">CIEP</gloss> Review Group meeting which we
                            attended today brought out the following: <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168"
                                facs="0196"/>

                                <item>—There is disagreement amongst the agencies as to precisely
                                    what reforms we wish Japan to undertake. Commerce would like
                                    Japan to allow in more American private investment; however,
                                    Treasury believes this would have a negative effect in the short
                                    run on our balance of payments. A number of agencies are
                                    pressing Japan to revalue the yen, although the amount of the
                                    revaluation acceptable to the agencies varies from Treasury’s 20
                                    to 25 percent (which Japan could not possibly accept) to State
                                    and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> believing a 7 to 10
                                    percent revaluation could be acceptable (which, if Japan
                                    liberalizes its import requirements and provides more foreign
                                    aid, seems to be a more logical position). Other suggested
                                    measures include a liberalization of imports and voluntary
                                    restraints by Japan on her exports. However, it is obvious that
                                    Japan will not do everything we seek and the agencies do not
                                    seem to be able to focus on which reforms we should press
                                    hardest for at the September Ministerial meeting.</item>
                                <item>—All agencies seem to agree that we have little effective
                                    leverage short of the threat of quota legislation or the
                                    Administration’s imposing quotas under existing legislation
                                    (which <persName corresp="#p_PPG1">Peterson</persName> and
                                    Commerce advocate).</item>
                                <item>—There is a great deal of concern with the U.S. balance of
                                    payments and trade situation in general, and with Japan in
                                    particular. Last year the U.S. balance of payments deficit was
                                    $3 billion and in 1971 the estimate is approximately $8.5
                                    billion, while Japan is expected to realize a balance of payment
                                    surplus of approximately $7 billion in 1971. Approximately $2.5
                                    billion of the U.S. deficit will be with Japan.</item>
                                <item>—There are basically two schools of thought as to how to
                                    handle the above problem: one advocates solving our balance of
                                    payments problems primarily through export incentives and border
                                    taxes on imports—which would not be directed specifically
                                    against Japan—but would affect trade with all our partners,
                                    along with requesting Japan to conform to accepted rules of
                                    international trade. The second school of thought says that
                                    since Japan is quite obviously the major problem, we should
                                    exert strong efforts to improve our trade and balance of
                                    payments with her and avoid invoking measures which would affect
                                    trade with the Europeans.</item>

                            the President had announced in his New Economic Policy address on August
                            15 (see <ref target="#d168">Document 168</ref>). The memorandum noted
                            that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN1">Ushiba</persName> would want
                            assurances that the President’s economic measures, especially the
                            surcharge, were not intended to discriminate against Japan. In an August

                        <p>The memorandum of the August 21 conversation indicates that except for a
                            discussion of textiles, economic issues hardly arose. On textiles

                            with a paper that outlines the issues and various approaches that might

                            loosen ties with Japan would presumably be: a) to improve our chances of
                            achieving a detente with China; b) to give us greater freedom of action
                            to deal with Japan’s commercial aggressiveness; c) to force Japan, once
                            out of the hot house of association with the United States, to realize
                            that its own interests require Japan to assume a major degree of
                            responsibility for the welfare and progress of its neighbors; and d) to
                            reduce our defense expenditures in the rest of Asia…. The postwar
                            US/Japan relationship has been a unique arrangement. It has permitted
                            Japan to conduct an unprecedented experiment in the development of
                            national power and influence by economic growth without commensurate

                            <persName corresp="#p_PPG1">Peterson</persName>’s paper considered a
                            variety of issues, including those in the trade area and military
                            procurement, and included the following language on yen revaluation:</p>
                        <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0200"/>
                        <p>“From the standpoint of achieving significant reduction in Japan’s
                            overall trade and payments surpluses—and corresponding if somewhat
                            smaller improvement in the U.S. balances (both directly and through
                            effects in third-country markets)—revaluation of the yen is our highest
                            priority negotiating objective. In fact, it is contemplated that the
                            surtax will remain until we get a satisfactory resolution of the
                            exchange rate problem. We estimate, assuming general rate equilibrium,
                            that a 15% Japanese revaluation by itself in terms of the dollar will
                            improve our 1972 bilateral trade balance by about $1.5 billion or
                            perhaps $2 billion. Thus, by itself, yen revaluation could be expected
                            to help attain about 20% to 30% of our overall U.S. trade balance
                            improvement target of about $6-$8 billion.”</p>
                        <p>The paper listed some advantages to revaluation including “substantially
                            strengthen[ing] the precedent for revaluations within the world monetary
                            system, clearly of special interest to the U.S.” The paper then
                            continued:</p>
                        <p>“Revaluation would have certain disadvantages, however, relative to other
                            less comprehensive objectives and measures: <list>

                                    a large revaluation is taken. Also, over the short run, a
                                    revaluation could have some perverse effects.</item>

                                xml:id="d74fn4">Not further identified.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Very simply stated, our underlying objective is to preserve and
                            strengthen our vitally important relationship with Japan. We should
                            stress the importance which we attach to close cooperation with Japan
                            and our recognition of her role as a responsible, cooperative world
                            power. At the same time, we should attempt to persuade Japanese
                            ministers to accept the fact that such a role requires early and
                            effective measures to establish an appropriate balance in its external
                            economic relationships, including those with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>If we are to achieve these objectives, and recognizing there may be
                            special characteristics of the Japanese system, we must avoid appearing
                            to single out Japan for discriminatory treatment on economic matters. As
                            when dealing with other major countries, proposals <pb n="174"
                                xml:id="pg_174" facs="0202"/>from our side should be consistent with
                            a broader equilibrium in the world economy.</p>
                        <p>We must also remember the oft-repeated Japanese plea to the United
                            States, “Tell us what you want us to do, but don’t publicly press us to
                            do it.”</p>
                        <p>The Japanese ministers should be made to understand that the U.S. will
                            have to achieve a major turn-around in its balance of payments. Speaking
                            plainly, this will require that countries which have run huge surpluses
                            in their balance of payments with us will no longer be able to do so.
                            Some countries which have had deficits with us will have to see those
                            deficits increase. Given the large trading relationship between Japan
                            and the United States, which we wish to see expanded, and the U.S. need
                            for a satisfactory multilateral equilibrium, we will require a
                            reasonably balanced trading relationship between the two countries. Our
                            analysis strongly indicates that a global trade surplus of the dimension
                            necessary for the U.S. equilibrium cannot be achieved with a deficit in
                            our Japanese trade. It is our intention to review constantly progress in
                            our over-all balance, and to appraise the consistency of developments in
                            important bilateral accounts, to assure achievement of our goal. We hope
                            Japan recognizes the validity of this analysis and aim, and will
                            periodically review progress with us.</p>
                        <p>To this end, we should seek as priorities:<note n="5" xml:id="d74fn5">In

                                and Japanese balance-of-payments objectives were incompatible.

                                ever been given the opportunity to decide whether we wanted a
                                monetary system based on fixed exchange rates or one based on
                                floating rates? The President didn’t just want to patch up an old
                                system. If possible, he would like a good new one.”

                                <item>A clear understanding by the Japanese ministers that the
                                    United States considers a major revaluation of the yen in
                                    relation to the dollar to be a condition precedent to a
                                    satisfactory economic relationship with the United States. We
                                    would not at this meeting indicate the level which we would
                                    consider satisfactory or negotiate bilaterally on this subject.
                                    If the Japanese proposed a figure in the neighborhood of 10%, we
                                    would need to indicate a larger order of magnitude is necessary.

                                    two countries is necessary, and feasible by the end of 1973. It
                                    should be pointed out that, as we understand Japanese balance of
                                    payments and trade projections, they are incompatible with our
                                    objectives. It should be proposed that we work together to
                                    achieve mutually agreed compatible balance of payments

                            POSITION</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this note is to set forth U.S. views regarding the
                            requirements for a secure U.S. balance-of-payments position. We view
                            such a position not simply as in the interests of the U.S. but as a
                            prerequisite <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0208"/>for a return to a
                            smooth and orderly functioning international monetary system. Actions
                            are needed which both compensate for the past erosion of the U.S.
                            external position and offer the prospect of a strong position in the
                            future. To achieve these results after years of deficit, the U.S. will
                            require the reasonable prospect of some surplus in its basic external
                            accounts for several years.</p>
                        <p>Achievement of a secure U.S. payments position presupposes an improved
                            performance of the domestic economy. The President has taken such
                            action. However, success plainly also requires the correction of certain
                            elements which adversely affect U.S. international transactions. It is
                            not proposed to deal here with the nature of the actions required but
                            with the magnitude of the adjustment problem. For its part, the U.S., of
                            course, remains determined to follow those domestic economic policies
                            necessary to control inflation and make the economy more competitive.
                            This paper is developed on that basis.</p>
                        <p>This paper does not deal with the future shape of the monetary system. No
                            matter what the system, an improvement in the U.S. position along the
                            lines described below will be necessary.</p>

                        <p>The deterioration of the U.S. external payments position is traced in the
                            table on the following page.<note n="2" xml:id="d76fn2">The table is not
                                printed.</note> The United States recorded persistent but not
                            unmanageable balance-of-payments deficits throughout the 1960s. From
                            1960 through 1969, the net liquidity balance was in continuous deficit,
                            averaging $3.1 billion per year. The official settlements balance was
                            also in deficit during most of that period, averaging $1.1 billion per
                            year. The deficit on current and long-term capital accounts (the basic
                            balance) averaged $1.4 billion per year. A deterioration in the U.S.’
                            basic position since 1964 is evident, with current and long-term capital
                            accounts in deficit by $3 billion in 1970.</p>
                        <p>The situation turned sharply worse in 1970 and 1971. By the first half of
                            1971, the deficit on current and long-term capital accounts rose to an
                            annual rate of $8.6 billion. While temporary factors presumably
                            contributed, these data confirm an eroding trend.</p>
                        <p>With continuing payments deficits, the United States reserve position has
                            been severely and persistently weakened. Gross reserves have fallen from
                            a high of $26.2 billion in 1949 to the present level of $12.2 billion
                            and now stand at about 27 percent of estimated 1971 imports, well below
                            other countries’ average level of reserve holdings relative to trade.
                            Furthermore, liquid liabilities have risen sharply, from $21 billion <pb
                                n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0209"/>in 1960 to more than $60
                            billion; liabilities to official holders amount to more than $44
                            billion.</p>
                        <p>The erosion of the merchandise trade position has been a primary element
                            in the unsatisfactory U.S. balance of payments in the past several years
                            and the major source, directly or indirectly, of the recent
                            deterioration in the basic balance. The trade balance has deteriorated
                            by more than $8 billion in the seven years 1964-1971 and is now in
                            deficit. In 1964, the U.S. had a trade surplus of $6-3/4 billion, which
                            amounted to 1.1 percent of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>. In the
                            entire first half of 1971, the trade deficit was running at a seasonally
                            adjusted annual rate of $1.5 billion.</p>
                        <p>As in the case of the overall balance of payments, the deterioration in
                            the trade position has accelerated recently. Before the President’s new
                            program was announced, trade deficits were forecast by U.S. Government
                            experts of about $2 billion for 1971 and $3.5 billion for 1972. The
                            forecast deterioration from 1970 to 1971 was $4 billion, partly
                            attributable to special factors and partly to cyclical factors.
                            Nevertheless, quite apart from the cyclical influences, the U.S.
                            merchandise trade position is experiencing a continuing trend
                            deterioration of more than $1 billion annually. This trend has also been
                            observed by the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Secretariat and
                            the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Over the years, the deterioration in the U.S. trade position is most
                            pronounced in trade with Japan, Canada, and the European Community,
                            although the recent sharp deterioration has been more widespread. The
                            following table traces the deterioration in the trade balance between
                            1964, when the U.S. trade surplus reached its peak, and 1970, and more
                            recently, by area:</p>

                        <p>The deterioration in the trade position has carried through into the
                            balance on goods, services and private remittances. The contribution to
                            an improved position from rising investment income receipts has been
                            insufficient to overcome mounting outpayments resulting from the rapid
                            growth of U.S. liabilities and high interest rate levels. The heavy <pb
                                n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0210"/>burden of defense expenditures
                            abroad has also served to offset potential improvements in the services
                            accounts.</p>
                        <p>The long-term capital account was not a factor in the deterioration of
                            the overall U.S. position until 1971, when uncertainty about exchange
                            rates apparently had a large adverse effect. The net private long-term
                            capital outflow declined from $4.5 billion in 1964, before comprehensive
                            restraints on capital outflows came into effect, to $1.5 billion in
                            1970.</p>
                        <p>In 1964 the U.S. was a net supplier of long-term private capital to all
                            areas of the world. Canada received $1.1 billion, Europe and Japan $2.2
                            billion and the rest of the world $1.2 billion. With capital
                            restrictions, higher interest rates in the U.S., and a surge of
                            investment in U.S. securities, this situation shifted sharply. From 1968
                            through 1970 the U.S. was a net importer of private long-term capital
                            from the major industrial countries other than Canada, as follows:</p>

                        <p>The deficit in the U.S. balance of payments could not be allowed to
                            continue: (a) It was leading to rapid depletion of U.S. reserve assets
                            and the accumulation of an unstable mass of liquid liabilities. (b) Its
                            nature and extent became so widely recognized as to generate
                            speculation. (c) It led to an intensification of protectionist pressures
                            within the U.S. (d) It intensified the difficulties in maintaining an
                            appropriate share and level of both international assistance to less
                            developed countries and responsibilities in the area of global military
                            security. (e) It subjected the economic foundations of the international
                            monetary system to recurrent shocks. (f) It is not compatible with a
                            sustainable world payments equilibrium required for the fulfillment of
                            mutually shared national objectives.</p>
                        <p>Because the deficit has been so large and has continued for so long, the
                            solution of these problems now requires a complete and convincing
                            elimination of the deficits; this cannot be achieved without aiming at
                            some period of surplus in the U.S.’ basic accounts. Sustained reductions
                            of liquid liabilities would of course require significant surpluses

                            paper as a surplus of around $3 billion annually on current and
                            long-term capital accounts, or less than $2 billion after allowing for
                            errors and omissions.<note n="3" xml:id="d76fn3">A $3 billion surplus on

                                allowing for errors and omissions because the latter have shown a
                                persistent deficit averaging well over $1 billion annually. This is

                            surplus on goods, services and private remittances sufficient to finance
                            a foreign aid program appropriate to the United States position and to
                            accommodate foreign demands for U.S. long-term private capital in the
                            absence of U.S. Governmental restraints. Thus, the U.S. requires a
                            surplus on goods, services and private remittances of roughly $2 billion
                            more than the net deficit on government grants and capital, direct
                            investment and other private long-term investment and errors and
                            omissions.</p>
                        <p>Such a position allows for no net short-term capital outflows, and thus
                            would approximate equilibrium on official settlements and only a modest

                        <p>While a surplus on merchandise trade account is not necessary in theory,
                            there is no prospect at this time, particularly with the current net
                            expenditures on military transactions, that these requirements can be
                            met unless the U.S. has a substantial merchandise trade surplus. Without

                            payments on foreign investments in the U.S., including interest on
                            liquid liabilities, are likely to rise as much as the income from U.S.
                            investments abroad, eliminating the likelihood of net improvement in the

                                    >OECD</gloss> Secretariat, in CPE/WP3(71)13 suggests that
                                adjustments in the U.S. balance-of-payments figures for 1970 to
                                correct for cyclical factors should be somewhat larger than those
                                used in the U.S. calculations. The Secretariat’s cyclical adjustment
                                for the goods, services and remittances balance in 1970 is about $1
                                billion larger than the U.S. figure, largely because the U.S.
                                estimate provides for a downward adjustment of extraordinarily high
                                interest payments in that year. (The figures for this balance used
                                by the U.S. and the Secretariat also differ because the U.S.
                                includes U.S. Government pension payments whereas the Secretariat
                                does not.) [Footnote in the source text.]</note>

                            billion to achieve a minimal surplus in its basic accounts (and
                            therefore assured equilibrium in its official settlements accounts) for
                            a period of years. A measure of improvement based on the actual U.S.
                            position in 1970 or even on the cyclically adjusted position in that
                            year would not be adequate. It would not take account of the very
                            serious trend deterioration in the underlying position which must be
                            expected to continue until a fundamental correction is achieved.</p>

                            trade measures, the improvement would have to be found predominantly in
                            the merchandise trade account. Although the dollar income from foreign
                            investment could be expected to rise and travel expenditures might
                            decline somewhat with an exchange rate realignment, the increased dollar
                            equivalent of foreign currency costs of U.S. military expenditures
                            abroad together with increased shipping costs would be likely to offset
                            much of these improvements. The only foreseeable means of reducing to
                            some extent the required adjustment in trade would be a modification of
                            arrangements for financing U.S. military expenditures in NATO countries
                            or in Japan.</p>
                        <p>An improvement of $13 billion in the U.S. merchandise trade position from
                            the cyclically adjusted deficit projected for 1972 would mean a surplus
                            of only $8 billion. Such a surplus would be little more than the surplus
                            which the U.S. had in 1964 ($6.8 billion) when the total volume of world
                            trade and production was much lower. Prior to recent developments,
                            Germany and Japan were expected to have trade surpluses of around $6
                            billion in 1971. It would also be much less in relation to U.S. <gloss

                            the U.S. capital market.</p>
                        <p>In recent years net flows of capital and government grants to <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>’s have averaged over $5-1/2 billion
                            annually. Increased borrowing on the U.S. capital market by
                            international lending institutions is possible. Thus an expected net
                            grants and long-term capital flow in the $6 billion range in 1972
                            represents essentially a flow to <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>’s,
                            without significant net capital outflows to industrial nations. In fact,
                            a level of grants and long-term capital outflow of 1/2 percent of <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>—even though it all goes to <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>’s—is likely to be subject to criticism

                            <item>The assumption is optimistic that there will be no net outflow of
                                long-term capital to industrial nations. The U.S. wishes to remove
                                its temporary restraints on long-term capital outflows, and believes
                                any long-term equilibrium must properly assume such removal. We
                                cannot be certain that a change in exchange rates would so shift the
                                attractiveness of the U.S. relative to other industrial countries as
                                a site for investment in manufacturing industries that U.S.
                                restraints on capital outflows (including the interest equalization
                                tax) could be removed without resulting in substantial net flow of
                                long-term capital from the U.S. to other industrialized countries,
                                taken as a group. In particular no allowance is made for repayments
                                of foreign debts incurred by U.S. corporations in financing foreign
                                investments over the past few years when the capital controls
                                program was in effect. Moreover, no allowance is made for future
                                Canadian use of the New York capital market nor for any net use of
                                this market by European borrowers. The U.S. has supplied an average
                                of $1.2 billion per year net of private long-term capital to Canada.
                                If this were to continue the U.S. would need a correspondingly
                                larger goods and services surplus (unless long-term funds moved to
                                the U.S. from the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> and Japan). The
                                possibility that net long-term capital outflows are being
                                underestimated is further supported by the fact that improvements in
                                the goods and services balance have almost always been accompanied
                                by substantial increases in net long-term capital outflows.
                                Certainly to the extent that a new increase in exports may involve
                                an increase in outstanding trade credits, an increase would be
                                expected.</item>

                            have to be worked out on a multilateral basis, it is imperative that
                            substantial changes be made. Another point he wished to emphasize was
                            that the textile matter, which had not received much <pb n="189"

                                that the President “express regret that the <gloss

                                liberalization. He also suggested the President make clear to

                            aside, if problems exist between our two countries, they should be fully
                            and frankly discussed.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> suggested the
                            smart thing for the U.S. and Japan to do would be to get off in a corner
                            and agree on a trade arrangement between themselves and invite in other
                            countries, including <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s. Japan and the
                            U.S. should trade for each other and not in competition. Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_MM4">Mizuta</persName> replied that in the
                            long future he felt that Japan, the U.S., Canada, and Australia might
                            well get together on the Pacific Basin concept. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> pointed out that Europe was
                            forming a trading bloc against the U.S. and Japan. These two countries
                            should protect themselves. However, he posed one condition: that the
                            U.S. get a head start of six months because otherwise we would never
                            catch up with Japan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>
                            doubted that six months would suffice.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM4">Mizuta</persName> said that when
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">Meyer</persName> visited him two
                            weeks ago he had told the Ambassador that this was his third stint at
                            being Japan’s Finance Minister. The first two times Japan was in balance
                            of payment difficulties and the U.S. was very helpful. He is grateful
                            for that help and is the only Japanese Finance Minister who has had that
                            experience. Now he is aware that the U.S. is in difficulty and he is
                            willing to cooperate in turn. The argument he raised yesterday over
                            fundamental disequilibrium was perhaps misunderstood. He meant to say
                            that the Japanese performance in the first two quarters of 1971 has been
                            extraordinary due to cyclical conditions. Discounting this extraordinary
                            performance and adding the yen float and the surcharge, he thinks that
                            the Japanese surplus would be even smaller than the normal surplus Japan
                            should expect.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> replied that
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM4">Mizuta</persName> has had more than
                            his fair share of bad luck in being Finance Minister three different
                            times—once is plenty.</p>
                        <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0218"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> wished to
                            emphasize that regardless of U.S. attitudes in the past the time has
                            come when we must seek correction for our balance of payments
                            difficulties. While we understand Japanese political difficulties and
                            the problems of the party and personalities governing Japan, we hope
                            that Japan and other countries will recognize our problem and will help
                            us now as we helped in the past. It is only fair to say, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> went on, without in
                            any way meaning to be threatening, once the President understood the
                            problem and made his decision other countries would be very mistaken to
                            assume that we are not determined to solve our problem. We have seen the
                            U.S. trade account deteriorate steadily from 1964 to 1971. This has been
                            a strong and lasting trend and is a serious warning to the U.S.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> added that
                            he, and in his opinion the President, are convinced that we cannot solve
                            this problem with monetary or fiscal policy or exchange rate changes
                            alone. Trade barriers including tariffs, internal taxes, non-tariff
                            barriers, export subsidies, etc. of other nations were tolerated in the
                            past by the U.S. because our position was so strong that we could afford
                            to be tolerant. Now it is time for an appraisal of tariff and non-tariff
                            barriers all around the world.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he was not singling out Japan, but cited Japanese
                            forecasts of a $12 billion trade surplus in 1975. There are other
                            countries with whom we have similar difficulties—in particular Canada,
                            whose automobile industry we helped set up and which now provides
                            incentives for the Michelin Tire Company to come to Canada to make tires
                            for the U.S. market. The Canadians are going to have to help us too.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary added that we are aware that thus far there is some
                            question in the minds of governments around the world as to whether the
                            U.S. is really serious in its determination to solve its balance of
                            payments problem. There should be no question. The President is very
                            concerned and completely determined to solve the problem. If other
                            nations do not come to realize this, there will be great difficulties
                            for all of us.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM4">Mizuta</persName> replied that, as
                                <persName corresp="#p_FT1">Fukuda</persName> had said yesterday, we
                            are fully aware of the implication behind the President’s new economic
                            policy and we are also aware that internal measures—fiscal and
                            monetary—are not enough to solve the U.S. problem. The Japanese are
                            ready to cooperate, but Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM4"
                                >Mizuta</persName> is not confident that the current favorable
                            balance of payments for Japan will last another three years. He pointed
                            out that Japan has historically had a balance of payments deficit and
                            that the capital structure and income levels in Japan remain low. If the
                            yen were as strong as others think, the announcement of the President’s
                            new policy would not have had such an unsettling effect in Japan. The
                            stock market decline and general concern indicate that Japan is indeed
                            vulnerable.</p>
                        <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0219"/>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM4">Mizuta</persName>, however, added
                            that he is pleased to be Finance Minister this time around because for
                            the first time he is able freely to spend money in an effort to
                            stimulate the Japanese economy. Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM4"
                                >Mizuta</persName> reiterated that Japan was willing to share the
                            burden in an international cooperation effort but re-emphasized that he
                            is not optimistic about Japan’s balance of payments.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> said that the
                            problems between the U.S. and Japan could be divisible into three areas:
                            one, the cost of defense; two, trade restrictions; and three, exchange
                            rates. The first two of these are best handled by bilateral negotiations
                            between our two countries, while the third should be worked out in a
                            multilateral context. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> added, however, that Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MM4">Mizuta</persName> could be very helpful in the
                            latter area by making it clear to other countries that the U.S. problem
                            is serious and that we are determined to solve it. No other Finance
                            Ministers have had the opportunity for such a thorough exposure to the
                            U.S. position as had occurred during this Ministerial meeting. Finally,
                            the Secretary asked the Japanese Government to do some thinking about
                            where we go from here. He pointed out that Common Market developments
                            would change world trading patterns and that we and the Japanese should
                            do some thinking about these developments.</p>
                        <p>In summary, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>
                            said that the U.S. and Japan should set about now to reconcile their
                            first two problems (defense and trade barriers) in a bilateral
                            framework, while the third (exchange rates) should be dealt with in a
                            multilateral context in a different time frame.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM4">Mizuta</persName> said that his
                            impression of the recent <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> Deputies
                            meeting was that the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> is not in much of
                            a hurry to settle things. While the Minister is prepared to speak out
                            for international cooperation, he hoped that the present uncertainty
                            could be removed as soon as possible. What would be the American
                            position at the <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> Ministers meeting
                            regarding the surcharge, the price of gold, a de facto devaluation?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> replied that
                            although he would be talking to the President he did not expect to have
                            a proposal for the <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> meeting.<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d77fn4">The <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> met
                                in London September 15-16; see <ref target="#d78">Document
                                78</ref>.</note> The U.S. is reluctant to table any proposal, for
                            one good reason that other nations always complain that we are telling
                            them how to run their business. Other countries kept saying that the
                            U.S. should do something. Now we have done what we could to solve our
                            problem and it is up to the others to cooperate. If we were to make any
                            proposal, within 24 hours every nation in the world would denounce it
                            and us.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM4">Mizuta</persName> pointed out that
                            each country has its own domestic political problems and that while the
                            U.S. is asking others to cooperate, <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192"
                                facs="0220"/>from the point of view of other countries, it is
                            important for the U.S. to pave the way. If a general realignment of
                            currency parities is made in such a way that one country’s parity
                            remains unchanged while all others must change, this makes political
                            decisions very difficult for the others. Therefore, all countries’
                            parities should change. This is a contribution which the Secretary could
                            make at the <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> meeting.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> replied that
                            realignment of exchange rates is actually only the second priority.
                            Trade restrictions, tariffs, non-tariff barriers which discriminate
                            against American products are the first priority. The yen-dollar parity
                            has nothing to do with the freedom of an American to own 100 percent of
                            a company in Japan nor with the freedom to export to Japan. The
                            Secretary added that he was in no hurry to fix exchange rates until the
                            basic problem was solved because any country could change its exchange
                            rate—against the dollar—three weeks later.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM4">Mizuta</persName> said that his
                            reference to realignment as the first priority was based on Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>’ opening statement at
                            the <gloss target="#t_ECONCOM1">EconCom</gloss> 8. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> replied that one should not
                            believe what one reads in the public press.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM4">Mizuta</persName> said that he
                            understood the U.S. argument about the removal of trade barriers but
                            nevertheless realignment would also be important. Other countries in his
                            opinion were seriously considering this. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> reiterated that we do not
                            want to tell other countries what to do. He mentioned the question of
                            grants vs. loans and said that he could tell the Japanese that they
                            should make more of their aid in the form of grants but he wasn’t so
                            sure the Japanese weren’t right and that the U.S. shouldn’t tie its own
                            aid. But in any case although the Secretary could dictate a solution to
                            the balance of payments problems of Japan, Korea, Canada, and every
                            other country, the result would be a world uproar. It is, therefore, up
                            to the other countries to come forward with ideas to solve the problem.
                            In the meantime, the dollar, the yen, and the DM are all floating so we
                            can live for a while until every nation has a chance to evaluate its own
                            position. We are not going to push for anything at the upcoming</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> meeting. Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MM4">Mizuta</persName> replied that though the Secretary
                            had said that the U.S. economy is sick, the sick man is still very
                            strong. He could prescribe the cure but he doubted the sick man would
                            accept the prescription (laughter). Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> replied that the Minister was
                            right. We probably wouldn’t accept it: Japanese prescriptions have
                            usually been in terms of what is good for Japan and we need something
                            that will be good for the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM4">Mizuta</persName> thanked Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> for the Secretary’s
                            excellent explanation of the U.S. position and promised that in
                            international meetings Japan would participate in a spirit of
                            cooperation with the U.S. He looks forward to further exchanges like
                            this.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> agreed that
                            the present was a very good opportunity for himself and the Minister and
                            their staffs to see more of one another. With the growth in power of
                            Russia, China, and the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>, the Secretary
                            expects that the U.S. and Japan will inevitably be pushed closer

                            September 15-16, 1971. In his prepared remarks Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> recognized the difficulties
                            in achieving the $13 billion turnaround in the U.S. current account, but
                            took strong exception to those who thought the U.S. goal overly
                            ambitious. He said it was “important,” it was “essential,” it was
                            “absolutely essential, that a formula be developed in the very near
                            future that would anticipate that the balance of payments would be
                            corrected in a relatively short period of time.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>’s statement, along with those

                            <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> went on to say that he
                            knew the <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss>’s purpose was to consider
                            problems “strictly monetary in character” and that he did not want to
                            inject items into the discussion that were not soluble in the</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss>, but he thought the <gloss
                                target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> ought to concern itself with other
                            problems that at least were soluble in the Councils of the nations that

                            <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> represented. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> mentioned two: restrictive
                            trade practices and the need to promote free trade and a fair and
                            equitable trading system and defense burdensharing. Concerning the
                            latter, <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> noted that the
                            United States devoted 8.9 percent of its <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                                >GNP</gloss> and 36 percent of its budget to defense, and no other
                            industrial nation came close to those magnitudes. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> asserted this should be
                            discussed and considered as part of the overall realignments that were
                            coming.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Until significant progress is made on exchange rate realignment and
                            negotiations related to the removal of the surtax, it may not be
                            appropriate to submit important foreign economic and trade legislation.
                            Presently, there is great uncertainty as to how long these negotiations
                            will take. We are to work on the assumption that we should have in the
                            President’s hand a comprehensive outline of positive legislative
                            recommendations by year end. Also, we should have defensive or
                            contingency legislative plans in case the Labor Union’s programs make
                            major progress in Congress. Another consideration in this timing is the
                            State of the Union Message. We are to assume further that the question
                            of America’s position in the world economy will continue to be
                            sufficiently important to warrant emphasis in that message. For these
                            reasons, we are directed to adhere to the schedules as outlined in the
                            work projects.</p>

                        <p>1. Planning a series of major bilateral negotiating initiatives—Japan
                            (already completed), Canada, and <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>—as
                            well as multilateral initiatives at the <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                                >OECD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, and <gloss

                        <p>2. Defining specific policies and programs on foreign investment policy
                            (particularly technology transfer, expropriation, multinational
                            corporations and stimulating foreign investment in the U.S.).</p>
                        <p>3. Major programs on adjustment assistance for impacted industries.</p>
                        <p>4. Intensified export promotion program (incentives, financing, East-West
                            trade, trading companies, antitrust, etc.).</p>
                        <p>5. Trade legislation contingency plan (labor unions are pushing ahead
                            vigorously).</p>
                        <p>6. U.S. competitiveness, growth and productivity in the 70s. (Attached
                            are copies of the charts used during our Council meeting to refresh your
                            memories on the specifics.)<note n="3" xml:id="d79fn3">Several lists of
                                items related to this topic are attached (none printed) but no
                                charts were found.</note> It turns out these programs are
                            essentially domestic in nature since, without a strong domestic economy,
                            it will be very difficult to have a strong, outward-looking foreign
                            economic policy. This also emphasizes the importance of emphasizing
                            concern with job effects of our programs, since concern over loss of
                            jobs due to imports and foreign investments is obviously an increasingly
                            important issue. On most of these points, the Council’s role will be to
                            define and <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0224"/>stimulate rather
                            than to implement. Thus, we have and will continue to work very closely
                            with the Domestic Council on most of these projects.</p>

                            projects. We request that, prior to naming any specific consultant, a

                            President’s initiatives of August 15, we may well be in a unique
                            position to put forward a positive foreign economic legislative program,
                            something that seemed very unlikely even a few months ago.</p>

                                C/A surplus was for transitional period and not forever; that

                                C/A surplus was no higher than in the mid-60’s; that return flows of
                                funds and increased demand for dollars could not cover adjustment
                                gap since there would be no such flow in absence of convincing
                                elimination of U.S. deficit and in any event would be needed for

                                was fully felt; that our estimates took full account of expected
                                strengthening of U.S. competitiveness; that no reason to assume
                                every WP-3 member needed the same size surplus relative to <gloss

                            useful to summarize present state of Japanese views on this subject.
                            Japanese have been casting about for ways to cope with apparent pending
                            US demands on defense burden-sharing. They see issues as falling into
                            different categories. All Japanese seem to favor idea of increasing
                            economic aid to Southeast Asia, and <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                            has already started to do this. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                            expects double its concessional aid in <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>
                            71 to $700 million. It intends to increase total financial flows abroad
                            to one percent of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> by 1975 (about $4
                            billion). Possible proposal that Japan assume a greater share than
                            present of US garrison costs in Japan, in ways amounting to defense
                            support arrangement, has met with categorical opposition. Question of
                            increasing arms purchases from US is being debated with increasing
                            intensity. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> favors idea, mainly as a
                            means to cut cost of expensive new weapons programs, and despite

                            will purchase $800 million to $1 billion worth of US equipment, or

                            <item>Defense burden-sharing has become one of major concerns of the
                                Japanese in recent weeks. Japanese are not clear as to what this may
                                entail or its ultimate cost. They feel they must respond positively
                                in some manner to placate the US and win concessions on currency and
                                trade issues, but do so in light their plans to prune already modest
                                defense budget proposals because of anticipated revenue

                            <item>In <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> and public mind, defense
                                burden-sharing consists of: (A) increased economic aid to Southeast
                                Asia to help compensate for US aid reductions; (B) assumption of a
                                greater share of costs for stationing US forces in Japan; and (C)
                                increased purchases of US military equipment. There has been little
                                opposition to point (A). Big business interests favor increased
                                economic aid as the means for meeting US defense burden-sharing
                                demands. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> not only expects to

                                XT-2) mainly in interest of cutting costs. Strong opposition views
                                have come from <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss> and industrial
                                organizations such as Keizai Doyukai (Committee for Economic
                                Development) and Keidanren (Federation of Economic Organizations).
                                They claim that increased purchases from abroad would represent a
                                reversal of former JDA Director General Nakasone’s “autonomous”
                                defense policy, which has as one of its long-term objectives
                                development of indigenous defense industry capable of meeting all of
                                JSDF’s equipment requirements. Business interests also argue that
                                foreign weapons purchases would detract from domestic development of
                                technological know-how and benefits to the economy, and subject JSDF

                            <item>JDA is now revising 4th defense buildup plan (covering JFY
                                1972-76) based on views of Finance Ministry and NDC Secretariat.
                                While definitive information is presently unavailable, it appears
                                likely that cost of this five-year plan may be reduced from 5.2
                                trillion yen ($16 billion at 330:1 current exchange rate), excluding
                                0.6 trillion yen for pay increases, to about 4.5 to 4.8 trillion yen
                                ($13.6 to $14.6 billion). Defense spending will, therefore, probably
                                range 8 to 13 percent below originally planned level. Heaviest cuts
                                will reportedly be made in supply, service support, and procurement
                                of new equipment. Embassy (MDAO) believes reduction in last category
                                will probably be in neighborhood of 20 to 25 percent.</item>

                            <item>Latest indication is that, partly as result of Finance Ministry
                                pressure, JDA would make little change in revised 4th DBP as regards
                                military purchases from US, despite overall budget reduction
                                indicated above. On 11 October, JDA Director General Nishimura
                                stated that his agency was currently studying possibility of buying
                                $800 million and, “depending on circumstances,” up to $1 billion
                                worth of equipment from US under that plan. Relative to purchases
                                from the US under the current 3rd DBP (estimated at $500 million by
                                Nishimura), his latest estimates represent increases of 60 to 100
                                percent at 360:1 exchange rate, or increases of 45 to 85 percent at
                                330:1 exchange rate. Thus, even at a <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204"
                                    facs="0232"/>time of budgetary stress, there will still be
                                proportionately large purchases of US military equipment and
                                technology out of total sums available for procuring new
                                equipment.</item>

                                repeatedly emphasized that JDA would make no basic change in its
                                “autonomous” defense policy. On 11 October, he said that despite
                                reduction of total spending under 4th DBP, he hoped to increase R
                                and <gloss target="#t_D1">D</gloss> funds above originally planned
                                levels. He said primary effort would be placed on development of

                        <p>Your own discussions should concentrate on your forthcoming visits to the

                            international issues as well as bilateral problems.</p>
                        <p>Our Allies should be left with the clear impression that we do not intend
                            to negotiate in Moscow on security issues that affect their interests.
                            They should be disabused of the idea that we intend to negotiate mutual
                            and balanced force reductions or an arrangement for a CES with the
                            Soviets bilaterally. You should alert them to the possibility that some
                            agreements may be reached in connection with the Moscow visit e.g., on

                        <p>I believe you should particularly stress that any ally, in going to
                            Moscow, will be most successful if he is backed by the strength of the
                            Alliance. To this end, you should stress your firm intent to maintain
                            U.S. forces in Europe and the need for our Allies to pursue improvements
                            in their conventional force capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Regarding Peking, you should emphasize that your purpose is the
                            initiation of a dialogue to remove the misunderstanding that has
                            accumulated over the decades. Therefore, no dramatic results or major
                            agreements are foreseen; there is no intention to reach agreements on
                            third party problems or change existing commitments. <persName

                                Policy; see <ref target="#d168">Documents 168</ref> ff.</note> It is
                            now recognized that the imbalance in the international economic system
                            has to be corrected and that fundamental measures are necessary to
                            achieve this. The outcome of recent sessions of the Group of Ten in Rome
                            appears to indicate that we now have an opportunity to reach a near-term
                            settlement involving a major realignment of the principal currencies and
                            some concessions in the trade field. We should concentrate our attention
                            on realignment initially because gains in that area will produce the
                            greatest results both in terms of our international balance of payments
                            and in the strength of the American economy.</p>
                        <p>The shock treatment used to achieve this major breakthrough, however, has
                            left bruised feelings and concerns about the future direction of
                            American economic policy. The succession of consultations you will have
                            can lead to a strengthening of allied relationships and create a firm
                            basis for going on with the next stage in talks looking toward the
                            creation of new monetary arrangements and negotiations for expansion of
                            trade. Your talks can serve the purpose of beginning this next stage
                            with the firm assurances that the United States, under your leadership,
                            has no intention of retreating into an isolationist or protectionist
                            policy.</p>

                                and <ref target="#d201">201</ref>.</note> we continued to make the
                            point that part of our needed balance of payments adjustment should be
                            an improved arrangement for defense burden-sharing. This point was
                            explicit in your August 15 speech. We took the position that this was a
                            matter that had to be discussed in the NATO forum. Thus, if we fail to
                            carry through with this position at the NATO ministerial meeting in
                            Brussels this week, we will have passed up the obvious time and place.
                            That will leave us in a weak position for pressing the issue later.</p>
                        <p>This means that we need to decide now whether the Administration is to
                            rely solely on the European Defense Improvement Program, which gives us
                            no financial help, or whether we should also seek some multilateral
                            arrangement for sharing the foreign-exchange burden of defense. The
                            extra effort we are asking our Allies to make with their own defense
                            forces requires only an additional fraction of one percent of their
                            Gross National Product. What we need from them as financial
                            burden-sharing comes only from their excess dollar reserves. It would
                            not require added manpower or use any of their real resources, although
                            it might add to their internal budgets.</p>
                        <p>I believe we have a proposal we could put on the table along with the
                            European Defense Improvement Program. It is to designate all <pb n="208"
                                xml:id="pg_208" facs="0236"/>extra-territorial military bases in
                            NATO Europe as “NATO bases.” These consist mostly of American, British,
                            and Canadian bases in Germany. The annual costs of about $1.2 billion of
                            operating these bases—though not the pay and equipment of the forces
                            manning them—would be placed in a NATO bases budget, to which NATO
                            members would contribute negotiated shares. An appropriate offer by the
                            United States as to its share of this new budget would be the same 30
                            percent now borne by the United States in the NATO infrastructure
                            budget.</p>
                        <p>As a component of a larger settlement with the European nations, the
                            United States could also press France to pay off over a reasonable
                            period of, say, four years the NATO losses of approximately $700 million
                            that resulted from premature termination of the agreement to station
                            NATO forces in France. Four hundred million dollars of those losses were
                            incurred by the United States.</p>
                        <p>This proposal for a NATO bases budget is reasonable. I believe that other
                            countries would support the principle. There have been many indications
                            from key Europeans, particularly from the German Government, that they
                            are anxious to find some new and more stable basis for continuing the
                            American presence in Europe. In my meetings with finance ministers, I
                            have found philosophical agreement that there needs to be some
                            arrangement of this kind. We can expect resistance when it comes to
                            budgetary impact and negotiating a formula for shares, but there is
                            recognition of the principle. The mood in the Nation and in the Congress
                            makes it urgent that we obtain such an arrangement. The benefit would be
                            political as well as financial.</p>
                        <p>The merits of the proposal aside, we should not give away this issue for
                            nothing. Even if we fail to get financial burden-sharing, vigorous
                            pressure for it may help us arrive at better economic arrangements in
                            other fields.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, it would be most helpful if Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> emphasizes burden-sharing at the
                            NATO ministerial meetings this week. Indeed, if this issue is to be kept
                            alive, we will need to make a proposal for a multilateral financial
                            arrangement on the table at NATO. If you agree, the attached draft
                            statement outlines our approach for the use of our delegation.<note

                        <p>Minister Pepin indicated Canada’s desire to keep trade discussions
                            outside of the surcharge context and to discuss “trade irritants” of
                            interest to both the U.S. and Canada. Trade irritants for the U.S. were
                            the Canadian-American Automotive Agreement, tourist allowances for
                            Canadian tourists returning to Canada, and the Defense Production
                            Sharing Arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Canada was concerned with such matters as uranium, petro-chemicals and
                            U.S. anti-dumping regulations. Canada believes it must have a balanced
                            trade package in which it also receives something from the U.S. and does
                            not believe the U.S. has helped in developing this package. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJR1">Petty</persName> discussed Canada’s
                            request of changes in U.S. trade programs and indicated what was being
                            done on these matters.</p>
                        <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0238"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> indicated a
                            need for Canada to help the U.S. eliminate its balance of payments
                            deficit. Minister Benson insisted that Canada had a deficit on current
                            account (trade and invisibles) with the U.S. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> indicated that the reverse is
                            true and that last year Canada had had a trade surplus with the U.S. of
                            $1.7 billion. (These terms and our figures are illustrated below) Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> pointed out that
                            Canada continues to be a strong exporter of goods and a strong importer
                            of capital. Minister Benson maintained that last year Canada’s overall
                            surplus on current account was less than one-half of what it was in 1970
                            and that capital inflows have fallen off steadily. Canada also pointed
                            out that it has engaged in a clean float in which its dollar has floated
                            upwards and that forces currently at play will decrease or eliminate
                            Canada’s surplus with the U.S.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> pointed out
                            that we will have a deficit of $10-11 billion in 1972, and that we would
                            expect some help from Canada in improving our position. He indicated
                            that the Canadian dollar was undervalued. Minister Benson replied that
                            it was not, and that Canada was allowing its dollar to float freely and
                            would re-peg it when it arrives at a sustainable market rate. It had
                            moved upward recently and was now nearly at par. Canada’s pulp and paper
                            industry, to cite one example, had been hurt by the exchange rate
                            adjustments, and is now realizing no profits. He indicated that Canada
                            had a deficit of $220 million on current account with U.S. last year. It
                            had had a $2 billion overall current account deficit in 1965 and had
                            steadily progressed to the point where it has a much smaller
                            deficit.</p>
                        <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0239"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> repeated that
                            the U.S. had a $1.7 billion trade deficit with Canada and a current
                            account deficit of $600 million. Canada stated that the U.S. had a
                            current account surplus with Canada, but that its basic balance with
                            Canada was indeed in deficit.</p>
                        <p>Canada strongly asserted its intention to let the market rate determine
                            the value of its dollar and to re-peg when it is sure it has a
                            sustainable rate. It hopes to do this as soon as possible. Canada
                            pointed out that its currency is extremely vulnerable to market crises
                            primarily because big American firms can move huge sums of money across
                            the border almost instantly.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> wanted to know
                            whether, because it was so intent upon floating, Canada would help him
                            at the next Group of Ten meeting to get others to float as well. He said
                            that U.S. would be happy to keep its dollar floating if others agreed to
                            float. Canada indicated that its policy was to float because it would be
                            difficult to re-peg while monetary conditions were uncertain. However,
                            other countries may assess their interests differently. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> indicated that
                            Canada should be able to find a viable parity for its currency; and,
                            that, because it has floated longer than anyone else, it should know at
                            what rate the Canadian dollar could be sustained. Minister Benson
                            indicated that Canada did not know, during this period of uncertainty,
                            at what rate its dollar could be sustained and could not afford to
                            re-peg at a rate which would necessitate large-scale Canadian
                            intervention in the exchange market. It would float until it did have
                            enough information to re-peg.</p>

                            Minister Pepin indicated that Canada was prepared to remove the first
                            two (the requirement that auto manufacturers in Canada produce in Canada
                            approximately 75% of all products sold there, and that their companies
                            maintain specific minimums of absolute values of their production in
                            Canada) of the three “transitional safeguards” of the Canadian-American
                            Automotive Agreement, but is still sticking on the third-no duty-free
                            import of automobiles by individuals, (i.e. Americans are free to import
                            cars from Canada, but Canadian individuals must still pay a 15% duty on
                            cars imported from the U.S.). Minister Pepin indicated that a committee
                            should be set up to look at this tariff, and examine measures to broaden
                            the agreement. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> indicated that “symmetry” would dictate imports
                            of American cars into Canada be treated the same way as Canadian cars
                            into the U.S.</p>

                        <p>On tourist allowances, Canada indicated that it was willing to raise the
                            exemption on duty from $25.00 to $50.00, and would be willing for the
                            U.S. to drop its duty-free allowances from $100 to $50.00. With regard
                            to granting special tariff exemption for Micheline to build a factory in
                            Canada, Minister Pepin indicated that Canada would make no tariff change
                            without first consulting with the U.S. Minister Pepin indicated a desire
                            to develop a package on “irritants” and was willing to continue
                            negotiations to this end. Pepin indicated, however, that it would be
                            politically very difficult to drop the third “safeguard” in the Canadian
                            Automotive Agreement at this time. In fact, he said, the Canadian
                            Government was way out on a limb for having agreed to remove two of
                            three.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> indicated that the
                            U.S. wanted a solution conducive to expanded trade. Canada had imposed
                            certain trade restrictions when it was in deficit. He proposed that we
                            negotiate to make these arrangements reciprocal, and that we take the
                            necessary political steps to bring this about. Canada indicated,
                            however, that it would have to get a <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss> waiver to remove the 15% duty on cars imported by
                            individual Canadians from the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> indicated that
                            it would be important to reaching a solution to the monetary problem in
                            the near future if Canada could move on these trade issues. He felt that
                            we should try for reciprocity in our trade arrangements. Minister Pepin
                            indicated that this might be possible. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> again repeated the importance
                            which this country attaches to resolving our balance of payments and
                            trade problems and indicated that Canada would have to do its share.</p>
                        <p>The meeting concluded with the understanding that the bilateral committee
                            being established to find solutions to trade irritants would submit its
                            recommendations by December 17.<note n="3" xml:id="d85fn3">According to

                            stability … the development of a 5-power consultative process (adding
                            Italy, perhaps, and Canada) would not only serve the needs of the Free
                            World, but would also contribute to the development of cohesion in

                                    of the risks and costs involved (we have more than $30 billion
                                    of investment in Canada), other agencies cannot be expected to
                                    subscribe. We do not object in principle to unilateral action—we
                                    took such action, for example, on Canadian oil. We do believe,
                                    however, that a cost-benefit assessment should be made in each

                            of economic isolationism or turning-inward on both sides of the Atlantic
                            which, if left unchecked, could drift toward a new kind of dangerous
                            political isolationism which neither side could afford, and (3) to
                            report on the status of the commercial negotiations in Moscow,<note

                            not concerned with generalized preferences for <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss>’s, though we did object strongly to the system of
                            reverse preferences which the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> worked
                            out with many of them.</p>
                        <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0251"/>
                        <p>In virtually every case, the response was that the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss> was forced into these arrangements for either domestic
                            socio-political reasons (the <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss>) or for
                            reasons related to economic or, mainly, foreign policy concerns. Typical
                            of these was my talk with <persName corresp="#p_BR2">Raymond
                                Barre</persName>, Commissioner for Financial and Monetary Policy at
                            the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> Commission.</p>
                        <p>On agriculture, <persName corresp="#p_BR2">Barre</persName>’s defense was
                            that Europe was just now going through the agricultural revolution which
                            the US had undergone during the 1930s. In about 10 years, this process
                            would be complete. Meanwhile, the US and Europe were talking past each
                            other on different levels of understanding about the nature of the
                            problem. On preferences, he (as did others) emphasized the political
                            importance to both Europe and the Atlantic Alliance of keeping the
                            Mediterranean countries closely associated with the West. In Europe, the
                            deals with the <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> non-applicants were
                            the inevitable consequence of British entry. The new <gloss
                                target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> could not erect new barriers to trade
                            among the different categories of <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>
                            countries where trade had previously been free. He thought we should
                            re-examine the problems this creates for outsiders on a reciprocal
                            basis, adding that, even if reciprocity is not full, there needs to be
                            some overall concept of “global reciprocity” to guide the next round of
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I responded to him, as to others, by noting that the solution to a
                            political problem in one country inevitably creates a political problem
                            for those at whose expense the solution has been imposed. This was
                            especially true in agriculture. I said I’d rather try to find an
                            intrinsically free trade solution rather than to continue to appeal to
                            each side’s comprehension of the other’s political problem. I said we
                            were not seeking to destroy the <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss>,
                            only asking that it be transformed into another kind of common policy
                            which would be fairer politically and more rational economically.</p>
                        <p>On preferences, I argued in all capitals that, while we understood (even
                            if we did not always accept) the rationale behind any particular deal,
                            what concerned us was the total implication of these deals taken as a
                            whole. Here is a clear case of the whole being greater than the sum of
                            its parts. I stressed that Americans see them as a conscious effort by
                            the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> to discriminate against us
                            commercially to Europe’s advantage while calling upon us to accept these
                            disadvantages on the grounds that they serve our common political and
                            security interests. I said that this kind of argument is no longer
                            acceptable in the US, and that Europe should be aware of the fact that
                            the days when we were able to accept almost any commercial costs for
                            political reasons are over.</p>
                        <p>The response to this line of argument varied among the capitals. My talk
                            with <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> was frank
                            and not discouraging. However, I cannot be optimistic about a
                            forthcoming French response. <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0252"/>In
                            Belgium, Davignon was positive, Fayat non-committal. The <gloss
                                target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> Commission was divided, but not
                            encouraging. (<persName corresp="#p_MSL2">Mansholt</persName>, for
                            reasons of his own, was not only indifferent but actually hostile. See

                        <p>The British clearly recognize the dangers involved if the trends I
                            discussed above are allowed to go unhindered. They agree on the need to
                            redress the imbalance between internal European preoccupations and
                            external relations. However, it is also clear they feel a constraint as
                            new members not to move out in front of the Six either too far or too
                            fast.</p>
                        <p>Within the Six as such, <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName>
                            was most encouraging. While he said Germany was determined to keep the
                                <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> outward-looking, even he cautioned
                            against expecting too much. However, he assured me that Germany would
                            work hard within the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> to prevent the
                            rise of blocism in both trade and monetary relations.</p>
                        <p>The Italians all make sympathetic statements about the problem and were
                            conscious of the need to avoid an Atlantic split. However, the internal
                            situation of political (and Ministerial) uncertainty led me to conclude
                            that, at the moment at least, the best we can expect from Italy is
                            support for someone else’s initiative, but certainly no disposition to
                            share a leadership role for an outward-looking reorientation of <gloss

                            June.</p>
                        <p>The alleged French opposition, he said, was mainly directed against the

                            monetary reform body at the September Fund meeting. The French tended to
                            confuse these with the <persName corresp="#p_VLE1">Van Lennep</persName>
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>During my talks in all the capitals, I found that no one questioned the

                            speech that there was need for consistency between trade and monetary

                            addressed and that, in all probability, the <gloss target="#t_OECD1"

                            >OECD</gloss>. He said he was originally inclined to favor the creation

                            against it, simply had to reverse himself to accommodate to reality.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III. Timing of Monetary Reform Negotiations</p>
                        <p>During my talk with <persName corresp="#p_BR2">Barre</persName>, it
                            became apparent that the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>, as a unit,
                            is still a long way from any kind of consensus concerning the objectives
                            which “Europe” should seek in reform negotiations. The first meeting at
                            which the Finance Ministers of the 10 will discuss this question has
                            just been scheduled for July 17 and 18 in London. The most optimistic
                            expectation for the emergence of a consensus, according to <persName
                                corresp="#p_BR2">Barre</persName>, would be at or after the
                            September <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> meeting. A more realistic
                            estimate would be not before October or November, at best.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BR2">Barre</persName> doubted that the October
                                <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> Summit would give much attention
                            to this issue. Its main preoccupations, he said, would be on
                            “consolidating” the internal <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> system
                            and the development of coordinated economic and social policies linked
                            to monetary union. Thus, the definition of a European position on reform
                            would probably be left in the hands of Finance Ministers for the
                            foreseeable future.</p>
                        <p>I asked each of the Finance Ministers I saw after the Brussels stop to
                            comment on this scenario. All agreed that it would not be realistic to
                            expect a fully coordinated <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> position
                            before year-end, if then. The British even remain skeptical that there
                            will ever be a fully common <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> position
                            short of the point of final agreement internationally.</p>
                        <p>I used these admissions to remind the Ministers that, given the lack of a
                            common <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> position, I hoped they no
                            longer believed that it was the U.S. which was dragging its feet on
                            initiating reform negotiations. All agreed that the fault was not
                            ours.</p>
                        <p>Barber used the occasion of our talk to emphasize his interest in hearing
                            from us any ideas we may have about the kind of reformed system we would
                            like to see come out of the negotiations. He said it would be very
                            useful to him in his talks with both the Europeans and the Commonwealth
                            Ministers. He particularly wanted to avoid the development of a
                            situation later this year in which, in the absence of clear signals from
                            the U.S., the U.K. and others began to find themselves being locked in
                            to a “European” consensus which would prove to be unacceptable to us. He
                            urged us to use him as a sort of honest broker and assured me that he
                            would respect the confidentiality of any ideas which were passed to him
                            that we wished to be so treated. I agreed he deserved a response to his
                            proposal, even if it were non-committal.</p>

                        <p>I am inclined to agree with <persName corresp="#p_BR2">Barre</persName>’s
                            assessment that, at least as of now, external relations is not likely to
                            be an item of great concern to the Europeans at the Summit.
                            Institutional and internal issues are expected to loom much larger by
                            comparison. On external relations, attention seemed to be about equally
                            divided among three areas: relations with developed countries, relations
                            with <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>’s and East-West issues.</p>
                        <p>In countries where I thought it would be useful (UK, Germany and
                            Belgium), I suggested that a declaration from the Summit, recognizing
                            that <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> enlargement imposed special
                            responsibilities on members toward their partners outside (and
                            especially toward those in the Atlantic Alliance) and stating the intent
                            of the 10 to move toward major reform of the international system and
                            external liberalization would be very helpful to us in stemming the tide
                            in the US toward the kind of economic and political isolationism of
                            which I warned them earlier.</p>
                        <p>The response to this proposal was positive from the British, <persName

                            would support such an initiative if others pushed it, and I was given to
                            understand that the Dutch would do likewise. I have no feel for the
                            Norwegians, Danes, Irish and Luxembourg.</p>
                        <p>While there are some risks involved, I believe the proposal should be
                            followed up with those who were responsive and I plan to do so.</p>

                            of the conference will in fact be economic. We will need to keep close
                            watch over the preparations for this meeting for at least two reasons:
                            (1) there are indications that some <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>
                            countries may be toying with the idea that special ad hoc preferential
                            arrangements could be worked out to promote closer industrial
                            cooperation between East and West Europe, and (2) there is a danger that
                            France may convince her <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> partners to go
                            into the Conference as a bloc with common positions, thus introducing a
                            split into NATO coordination.</p>

                        <p>Luns is particularly conscious of the latter danger and emphasized his
                            determination to see to it that the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> as
                            a group does not preempt decisions which should properly be discussed
                            and taken in NATO. He stressed in particular his opposition to the
                            French attempt to set up an <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> political
                            institution in Paris separate from the international organizations in

                            satisfaction with the Summit results, and were appreciative of the

                                expressing my conviction that, despite our satisfaction with the
                                progress we were making in improving Soviet-American relations, it
                                is the strengthening of the Atlantic system that deserves our
                                highest priority.</p>
                            <p>While not directly disagreeing, <persName corresp="#p_MSL2"
                                    >Mansholt</persName> responded with a long speech which began by
                                noting what he believed was a growing sentiment in European public
                                opinion and parliaments about the future of relations between the
                                developed and developing countries. He said that, in comparison with
                                the “minor” economic problems among developed countries, those
                                between developed and developing economies were much more
                                serious.</p>
                            <p>He had made two trips to the <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1"
                                    >UNCTAD</gloss> meeting at Santiago. He said that the U.S.
                                attitude there was, to say the least, disappointing. He warned that
                                Europe was becoming deeply concerned about the north-south split and
                                its implications for future peace. It seemed clear, from the U.S.
                                performance in Santiago, that this concern was not shared in
                                America. Thus, a serious confrontation between Europe and the U.S.
                                was in the making over trade and aid policies toward <gloss
                                    target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>’s. He assured me that Europe will
                                meet its obligations, even if the U.S. will not.</p>
                            <p>Specifically, the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> will begin to
                                develop commercial and industrial policies which will look to the
                                interests of the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>’s. The problems
                                Europe has with the U.S. are not important. The “<persName
                                    corresp="#p_EWD1">Eberle</persName> negotiations” earlier this
                                year were a big mistake for Europe. It was “silly” to have spent so
                                much time and political capital on a few million dollars worth of
                                trade in citrus fruit, tobacco, etc., when 20 percent of the world
                                was starving.</p>
                            <p>He assured me that he was not the least concerned with soyabeans,
                                (“to hell with your soyabeans”) but he was over palm oil because it
                                is an essential <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss> export. He said
                                we don’t need free trade or even market-determined trade in such
                                products but rather product agreements specifically designed to
                                organize trade in a way to favor <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>
                                exports. If the U.S. does not join in such arrangements, he was sure
                                Europe will go it alone. He even went so far as to suggest that
                                there should be no tariff reductions among developed countries,
                                since it would reduce the advantage of tariff preferences to the
                                    <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>’s.</p>
                            <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0257"/>
                            <p>On aid, he was highly critical of the U.S. which had consistently
                                failed in recent years to come anywhere near the one percent of
                                    <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> aid target. Here again,
                                Europe would meet its responsibilities even if the U.S. did not.</p>
                            <p>These problems, he suggested, would be the most critical with which
                                the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> summit should deal in its
                                discussion of relations with third countries (implying that
                                relations with the U.S. would be decidedly secondary). He also
                                stated that a large part of the new <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                    >EC</gloss> political cooperation talks (“an <gloss
                                    target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> foreign policy”) will be devoted to
                                consideration of strengthening economic links between the <gloss
                                    target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> and all developing countries. He
                                recognized that the past concentration on Africa was
                                disproportionate and that these links had to be broadened to include
                                South America, Asia, etc. He concluded that it was the real world he
                                was talking about, not that which occupied so much of the time of
                                our respective governments. He particularly stressed that the U.S.
                                members of Congress with whom he had talked were not aware of this
                                real world.</p>
                            <p>I replied that the real world in which a U.S. Congressman and Senator
                                lives is one of politics. I then said he should bear in mind that
                                the U.S. has been in the aid business—starting with Europe
                                itself—far longer and that the total of that aid over the years was
                                still the highest by far.</p>
                            <p>I then said that, in assessing responsibilities, he could not
                                overlook the fact that the U.S. bears the main burden of maintaining
                                the defensive shield of the free world. The percentage of <gloss
                                    target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> which we devote to this
                                responsibility is substantially higher than that of the Europeans.
                                (He attempted to debate this.) He should look at these—aid and
                                defense—together in judging who was meeting whose
                                responsibilities.</p>
                            <p>He said that, as a Socialist, he did not agree that the war in
                                Vietnam was contributing to the solution of the problems he had
                                outlined. I said that, even excluding our expenditures on Vietnam,
                                what I said still held up. As regards Europe in particular, it was
                                clear that the burden borne by us was more than disproportionate. If
                                Europe felt it could devote a larger percentage of its resources to
                                aid, that was fine, but it should understand that this was made
                                possible largely because it is not as burdened by defense
                                expenditures as we, even for Europe itself.</p>
                            <p>I went on to point out to him that, for 20 years, we have been
                                running balance of payments deficits, due largely to our military
                                and aid commitments. Europeans tell us this has to stop; that they
                                don’t want any more dollars. Under these circumstances, I didn’t see
                                how we could increase our aid as he suggested in the absence of some
                                fundamental readjustments in the monetary and trade systems—reforms
                                which recognize and take account of the fact that all these
                                issues—trade, aid, defense, finance—are interrelated.</p>

                            <p>Concerning preferences, I suggested his argument might be more
                                convincing in the absence of the reverse preferences which the
                                Europeans required from the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>’s,
                                whose value to the latter I failed to see. Finally, I said I thought
                                we both needed to give at least as much attention to the U.S.-<gloss
                                    target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> relationship as he wanted to give to
                                the developed-developing country problem.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSL2">Mansholt</persName> agreed that Europe
                                should shoulder more of its own defense burden. However, he said,
                                the real issue is that income from future growth needs to be
                                distributed more extensively to the <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                    >LDC</gloss>’s to close the gap. This should be done by heavy
                                new taxation in developed countries (even if it resulted in a
                                decline of standards of living in the developed countries, and in
                                the U.S. in particular as the richest), and by trading arrangements
                                to organize markets in favor of <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>
                                exports. We need, he said, to adapt our agricultural and industrial
                                policies to meet their needs. There is no need for developed
                                countries to produce those things which <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                    >LDC</gloss>’s can, even if the former can do it more
                                efficiently.</p>
                            <p>I said that his suggestion was not only unrealistic politically but
                                also contrary to all past experience. I said it had been my
                                experience that a prospering country with a high standard of living
                                was both a better market for <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>
                                exports and a more generous giver of aid. I asked how we could be
                                expected to import more—from <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>’s
                                or anyone—with falling demand and declining standards of living.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSL2">Mansholt</persName> did not answer but,
                                reverting to his Santiago experiences, charged that the U.S. was
                                embarked on a deliberate policy of destroying the only democratic
                                regime left in Latin America “in the same way we had destroyed
                                democracy in Cuba.” He said that Allende was faced with a serious
                                challenge from both the left and the right in Chile and that, if he
                                went under, the country would give way to anarchy and, ultimately,
                                become another Cuban-style dictatorship.</p>
                            <p>I said we had in no way interfered in Chile, and denied flatly that
                                we were embarked on any venture to destroy the Allende Government.
                                He fired back a question about our policy of voting against loans by
                                the international institutions to Chile. I replied that we felt that
                                the Chilean Government should discharge its obligations to the
                                companies it had expropriated before we could justify such loans. I
                                said we were not contesting Allende’s right to expropriate, but we
                                did believe he should offer prompt and adequate compensation.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSL2">Mansholt</persName> claimed that Chile
                                owed us nothing because companies like Anaconda had exploited Chile
                                for years, contributing nothing while withdrawing only profits. For
                                example, he said that, as a Socialist, he did not believe that
                                capitalism is effective or desirable as a means of promoting
                                development. He had visited El Teniente while in Chile and could
                                find no schools, no housing, no roads built by Anaconda to serve <pb
                                    n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0259"/>the people in all the years
                                it was there. Instead, there were large latifundia, estates, etc.
                                for the managers, while the peasants toiled in misery.</p>
                            <p>I asked him how many schools, houses, roads, etc. had been built by
                                the tax money collected from Anaconda by the governments (eg Frei)
                                which he professed to admire. He did not answer, contenting himself
                                with a remark that Allende was right to have not only assessed ex
                                post taxes but to have offered nothing to Anaconda.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN1">Ushiba</persName> stated that he
                            would be leaving for Tokyo tomorrow morning to meet with the new Prime
                            Minister who takes great interest in our mutual problems. He also stated
                            that Japan’s exports to the United States had eased very much compared
                            to last year partly because of voluntary agreements on textiles, autos
                            have leveled <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0260"/>off and
                            electronics have slowed. However in spite of these changes, a large
                            trade imbalance exists which Japanese business and government is anxious
                            to see reduced. The Ambassador believes that unless the trend is eased
                            by September or October, there will be very strong protectionist
                            pressures in this country.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> stated that the
                            strong Japanese surpluses were not compatible with a stable world
                            system. It’s not only a question of protectionist sentiment but in a
                            broader view it is not compatible with global stability. He further
                            stated that some very substantial changes with real magnitude were
                            necessary. The United States appreciates the goods Japan supplies us
                            with—our consumers want them. The Secretary stated that he had met the
                            new Prime Minister at a breakfast here and stated that the Prime
                            Minister was a strong man and that if he decided to do something, it
                            will get done.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commended on the recent go around on the financing of a
                            nuclear power plant in Japan.<note n="2" xml:id="d92fn2">On July 1

                                28 he had communicated with the Chairmen of Tokyo Electric Power and
                                the Japan Atomic Power Company about financing two projects from
                                Japanese dollar sources. Both had responded that it was not possible
                                in the timeframe necessary to line up financing. General Electric
                                Vice President Hoyt Steele also informed <persName corresp="#p_KH1"
                                    >Kearns</persName> of the need for Export-Import Bank financing
                                “if the United States is to achieve a major supply situation.”
                                (Ibid.) On July 7 Federal Reserve Governor Brimmer wrote <persName
                                    corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> expressing his concern over
                                an Export-Import Bank nuclear power loan for Japan, with which he
                                had reluctantly concurred in the National Advisory Committee
                                meeting. (Ibid.)</note> Japan has the resource and should have
                            financed the plant itself. It’s a question that goes beyond exports.
                            What we want is a stable world trading and payment situation and given
                            the income and price elasticities of Japan they are not consistent with
                            a stable world system.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN1">Ushiba</persName> stated that the
                            Japanese well understand the problem and that they were moving in the
                            right direction by trying to reflate the economy and use foreign
                            exchange for useful purposes. These things take time but Japan is moving
                            in the right direction.</p>

                            was important to have major things happen to bring about a better trade
                            balance. The magnitudes are gigantic and that while little things are
                            important they add up to numbers like $100 million or so—which is just a
                            drop in the bucket.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked the Ambassador if there was any prospect of Japan
                            setting targets for increased imports from the United States. He felt
                            this was useful for the short run. The Ambassador stated that this was
                            one of the themes to be taken up at the meeting in Hakone.<note n="3"

                            if this was a proposal from the U.S. side. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> stated that it was not a formal
                            proposal, but was a substantive thing to talk about.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN1">Ushiba</persName> stated that Japan
                            was considering some emergency measures such as stockpiling certain
                            commodities.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> stated that he
                            thought this was a possibility which might be considered but such
                            actions should be considered within the framework of a $3.6 billion
                            trade surplus with the United States and $8 billion overall. The numbers
                            that have to be brought into balance are very, very large.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN1">Ushiba</persName> stated that he
                            had been informed by his government that the basic trade trend is
                            changing—that trade should be less this year than last. Under Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> inquired as to
                            whether the Ambassador was referring to trade with the United States.
                            The Ambassador stated yes. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VPA1"
                                >Volcker</persName> stated that he didn’t believe this was true.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dyche</persName> stated that the results to date for 1972
                            indicate a deficit approaching at least $3.6 billion for the year, quite
                            apart from various forecasts that also show deficits in this range. It’s
                            difficult to see how a reduction for the year will come about in the
                            next five months.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN1">Ushiba</persName> stated that he is
                            certain that by end of year—by this fall a change will occur in the
                            trading pattern. The effect of the revaluation is beginning to be felt
                            and it is getting much more difficult to sell in existing markets.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> stated that we
                            must be realistic—the magnitudes are gigantic and that steps which have
                            potential for real magnitude must be taken.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN1">Ushiba</persName> inquired as to
                            what steps Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> had
                            in mind.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> said that a few
                            had been mentioned earlier. He thought the revaluation last December
                            should have been greater.<note n="4" xml:id="d92fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d221">Document 221</ref>.</note> Our studies showed a
                            revaluation of 25 percent would have been appropriate, even though we
                            agreed it probably could not be done at one time. Our economy is growing
                            faster this year and our imports will go up. He then reiterated that the
                            problem was a broad world matter and Japan must take actions with real
                            magnitude.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN1">Ushiba</persName> inquired as to
                            whether Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> thought
                            the U.S. economy would continue to expand.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> replied that he
                            thought so. The building of inventories is beginning and economy moving
                            quite well. The <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> problem <pb n="234"
                                xml:id="pg_234" facs="0262"/>is net negative exports—a problem in
                            the expansion of last year. Basically economic expansion seems to be
                            moving quite well—probably better than we forecast last January. Price
                            indexes with some exceptions are settling down. A major problem is the
                            management of 1973-74 budget, but the President has a way of getting
                            things around to his point of view. He stated he thought the domestic
                            economy looked good.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN1">Ushiba</persName> asked how the
                            dollar looked.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> doesn’t feel that
                            there should be a new dollar crisis at this time. The U.S. economy is
                            now stronger and prices are settling down. He thinks that the relative
                            position of the dollar abroad if anything, has moved in a more positive
                            direction. However, there remains the big deficit in our balance of
                            payments with Japan and Canada. It’s a joint problem and unless there is
                            a better balance, he sees no chance for stability.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN1">Ushiba</persName> asked a question
                            about when the G-20 would be meeting.<note n="5" xml:id="d92fn5">The
                                    <gloss target="#t_C201">C-20</gloss> met for the first time on

                            Also what happened to <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> felt the two
                            groups would have continuity and perhaps the two would come together at
                            some point. He indicated that the G-20 is broader to include the
                            developing countries. He stated there are a number of things that have
                            to be worked out—not only in an intellectual sense but in an
                            administrative sense. The United States wants to stay close to Japan as
                            we have a common problem.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> asked Under
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> if he had
                            anything to add. To this Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VPA1"
                                >Volcker</persName> stated that it was only a matter of emphasis. We
                            don’t have much time as the foreign exchange markets show. Although the
                            speculation occurs in Europe, one of the main reasons for speculation is
                            the imbalance between the United States and Japan, and speculation won’t
                            go away until our problem is resolved.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>, in concluding,
                            wished Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UN1">Ushiba</persName> a

                            Minister Nakasone and understood the Hakone talks had reached agreement
                            on 60-70 percent of the U.S. expectations. <persName corresp="#p_EWD1"
                                >Eberle</persName> said the Hakone talks had been “most useful,” but
                            added that a major disappointment had been limited progress on the
                            bilateral trade imbalance. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2"
                                >Tanaka</persName> indicated that he had already issued instructions

                            for the Japanese fiscal year ending March 31, 1973 (a U.S. projection
                            estimated it would be $3.6-3.8 billion). <persName corresp="#p_EWD1"
                                >Eberle</persName> agreed with <persName corresp="#p_TK2"

                            <item>The primary United States objective in the comprehensive trade and
                                monetary negotiations is to maintain a thrust toward a liberal
                                trading and payments order in a manner that supports our efforts to
                                restore and sustain an external economic equilibrium and equity or
                                fairness in our trading relationships, real and perceived. This
                                objective grows out of the fundamental goals of encouraging
                                competitiveness and efficiency in American enterprises and open,
                                harmonious political and economic relations with other nations, thus

                                growth and cohesion of the Western world. On the premise that
                                expanded world trade on an equitable basis and monetary and balance
                                of payments equilibrium can benefit all parties through more

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>: Particularly
                            since I learned you were coming, I have asked my officials to look at
                            the short-term and long-term trade picture. I have looked at your
                            figures myself.</p>
                        <p>To give you my rather frank estimate of the situation, I do not think it
                            is possible to arrive at a comfortable balance in a half year, or even
                            one year. Perhaps in a period of three years, having studied the issues,
                            we may be able to stabilize our economic relationship, in the sense of a
                            not so uncomfortable imbalance as today. All of us should be seeking to
                            achieve that goal, in that time frame, and I think it is possible.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What is the Prime
                            Minister’s definition of a “comfortable” trade balance?</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>: It is
                            perhaps a rather difficult question to answer in exact terms, because
                            basically you must seek a balance in a <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244"
                                facs="0272"/>multilateral sense; this can’t be achieved just between
                            the U.S. and Japan. In abstract terms, we don’t have export or import
                            terms where our going up or down is too abrupt. And if I remember the
                            figures from last year, the imbalance is on the order of $3.2 billion. I
                            have asked my officials to come up with means to reduce it to less than
                            $3 billion by the end of the present Japanese fiscal year, and if this
                            is not possible also to seek other means, in a multilateral sense, to
                            make the situation less difficult. So we may be able to arrive at within
                            not too long a trade balance which is less difficult. Not just between
                            ourselves but also with other areas—the Middle East, Europe—as long as
                            ten years, as well as near-term measures.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We agree there
                            cannot be an exact balance between our two countries, and that an
                            overall balance has to be solved on a multilateral basis. We also favor
                            a mid-term projection, in the framework which the Prime Minister
                            indicated. At the same time, if our bilateral balance becomes uneven,
                            the pressures within the U.S. for some sort of unilateral steps become
                            so great that we will never have the time to develop the long-term
                            projection.</p>

                                about economics, which is not a field I usually address in great
                                detail…. My major interest in economics is to make sure it doesn’t
                                disturb foreign policy.” (Memorandum of conversation; ibid.,

                            6/12/72)</note>—they seem to indicate the imbalance this year between
                            our two countries will be about $3.6-3.8 billion, according to our
                            figures. If that is accepted, if it could be reduced below $3 billion
                            before the end of your fiscal year, that would be a positive
                            contribution. We must think about what base you start with. And then, if
                            we can take another significant step next year, that will be considered
                            a very real progress.</p>
                        <p>Actually the President’s thinking is that, assuming these figures are
                            accepted, we should make an effort to get next year’s program settled
                            before Hawaii—because we don’t want to spend so much time negotiating on
                            purely commercial matters when we have so many profound political things
                            to discuss between us.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>: I quite
                            agree we ought to try to be tackling what you described as the profound
                            issues. On this question of the trade balance I have taken an active
                            part in asking my officials to see what measures are possible. Perhaps
                            we can work this out before Hawaii.<note n="3" xml:id="d96fn3">President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Prime Minister
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName> were scheduled to
                                meet in Hawaii August 31-September 1.</note> Perhaps we can ask
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IRS1">Ingersoll</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName>Hogen</persName> to look into the details. On the Japanese
                            side some of the issues are: purchases of enriched uranium; purchases of
                            civil aircraft; agricultural <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0273"
                            />purchases, which was discussed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EWD1"
                                >Eberle</persName> when we agreed to a special purchase of $50
                            million in addition to an estimated growth of $390 million in the
                            current fiscal year in agricultural purchases, to a total of $440
                            million. It could reach a figure of $500 million. But I must emphasize
                            that although we can put these figures together, it may not immediately
                            have effect in solving the imbalance problem, because some of this will
                            not show up immediately as Japanese imports. But by the end of March of
                            next year, which is the end of the Japanese fiscal year, we will see if
                            the Japanese officials concerned and a number of private companies might
                            come up with measures that could reduce the imbalance to less than $3
                            billion. In the main by increased purchases. Also, by lending in foreign
                            exchange terms, and at a cheaper rate of interest. These aren’t easy to
                            implement, and take time. But I want to emphasize that I have pressed
                            Japanese officials and Japanese companies to take steps which if they
                            don’t have an early effect will come up with a reduced imbalance.</p>
                        <p>There is also the question of whether we can liberalize our imports of
                            agricultural goods. Theoretically it is correct that if we reduce the
                            restrictions we might be able to purchase more—but it is also possible
                            that we might end up with increased Japanese purchases from Southeast
                            Asia, the Middle East, and even the Chinese mainland. We have to look at
                            a mechanism whereby we can increase purchases from the USA.</p>
                        <p>On economic issues, as you see, I have a list before me detailing the
                            items that can be increased. Gas turbine generators, for example. Let us
                            see what we can best do, before Honolulu. <persName corresp="#p_IRS1"
                                >Ingersoll</persName> and our officials can make their best efforts.
                            I don’t want to go into details now.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree. May I make
                            one suggestion, Mr. Prime Minister, in the spirit of frankness we have
                            always observed? Some of our differences in the previous period were due
                            to the fact that we had an agreement to do something in principle—but
                            the differences came up in the interpretation of what it means.
                            Therefore I believe that before Hawaii it would be helpful, and will
                            avoid difficulties in the future, if we could have an understanding on
                            what to do in detail, not just in principle. It would help if Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_IRS1">Ingersoll</persName> and your officials
                            could work out something concrete and detailed; for example, concretely
                            what a reduction of the trade imbalance to $3 billion means.</p>
                        <p>Then in Hawaii we can pass over the economic issues except in a general
                            way.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>: Yes. I think
                            it is important perhaps to look at it through three phases, or through
                            three actions. First of all, we agree in principle that we would seek a
                            more normal economic <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0274"
                            />relationship between our two countries; we acknowledge that as a
                            common goal. As I said, this could not be achieved in a period of one
                            year. It would take until 1973, or 74, or perhaps longer. Secondly it is
                            important to have meetings at the expert level as often as possible. An
                            idea comes to mind perhaps to organize them on a quarterly basis, to
                            look at the trade balance. Not just Ministers, but as at Hakone—with
                                <persName corresp="#p_EWD1">Eberle</persName>. Not too much
                            publicity.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> [interjecting]:<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d96fn4">These and all but the last set of brackets in

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>: That’s what
                            comes to mind. Perhaps in Tokyo, perhaps they might be invited to the
                            U.S.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We could
                            alternate.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>: The key is
                            closer contact.</p>
                        <p>Third, the fact of the matter, the problem is we are getting dollars in
                            increased numbers, and don’t have much to do with them. We bought
                            short-term Treasury Bills, <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s, but
                            refrained from buying gold so as not to drive up the price of gold.
                            Perhaps we could make more substantial purchases, perhaps $3-5 billion
                            of bills issued by the Federal Reserve Bank. I understand that the West
                            Germany authorities buy these on five-year terms. Perhaps we could do
                            this for longer, for 10 years. The experts can examine this. I
                            understand the Germans get 5% interest. Perhaps we can pay you more as a
                            means of bridging over the economic balance until we could seek longer
                            term measures, a more basic international balance.</p>
                        <p>The third idea is a proposal like the man-wife relationship in this
                            country: When they make a savings account they put it in both names, in
                            a joint account. We should be doing the same. We should be saving
                            jointly.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: When they break up,
                            one of them usually runs away with the money!</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>: With the
                            U.S., it is acceptable.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, Mr. Prime
                            Minister, I agree. For the long-term problem we need regular
                            consultation, perhaps a mechanism by which the experts could every three
                            to four months meet, with as little publicity as possible, perhaps at
                            alternating locations. As regards your specific suggestion, I think it
                            should be discussed by the appropriate experts. And also at Honolulu we
                            could discuss the basic mechanisms of how to deal with the problem.</p>
                        <p>But on the short-term problem, as I understand what you have said here,
                            we have agreed that before Honolulu, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_IRS1">Ingersoll</persName> and your officials will work
                            out a specific program to <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0275"
                            />reduce the deficit to $3 billion this fiscal year.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d96fn5">Later in the day <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName> discussed a wide range of topics with
                                Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM2">Ohira</persName> in
                                Tokyo. Concerning the trade balance issue, the memorandum of
                                conversation reads as follows:</note> So that that matter doesn’t
                            have to be dealt with at Honolulu.</p>
                        <p>“Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_OM2">Ohira</persName>: Well, on
                            the question of the trade imbalance which you touched on, it is a
                            question which we in the Foreign Ministry are quite deeply concerned
                            about. Under Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2"
                            >Tanaka</persName>’s energetic leadership we hope hard work can continue
                            so that by the time of the meeting in Hawaii we can announce to the
                            peoples of the two countries what we have arrived at. I think we can
                            conclude it.</p>
                        <p>“One thing on which I am a bit concerned, that is we are now talking
                            about trying to reduce the fiscal year imbalance to a level around $3
                            billion or a little below that; we are also trying to work out a package
                            between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IRS1">Ingersoll</persName> and
                            Minister Tsurumi. What concerns me is that these two things we want
                            might not necessarily meet as an exact figure. In the package, we are
                            talking not only about trade, but also about services and imports which
                            extend beyond this fiscal year. So the resulting package may not
                            necessarily be reflected in reductions in the trade imbalance referred
                            to earlier. In our talks you have understood this. I would like to make
                            doubly sure that there is full understanding of the question.</p>
                        <p>“Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Prime Minister
                            made this point this morning. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IRS1"
                                >Ingersoll</persName> and I have had a chance to discuss it at
                            lunch. We understand that some part of the package will not show up in
                            the trade imbalance until after this year. But we are talking about the
                            spirit and general objectives; we will not do it like bookkeepers.
                            [Laughter.] What we are talking about is reducing the deficit, and we
                            won’t be too concerned if some figures don’t show up in the trade
                            imbalance.” (National Archives, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>: When you
                            mention that we try to arrive at a program to cut it to $3 billion by
                            the end of our fiscal year, this isn’t entering figures in a bank
                            account. What is important is that either it can be done or it cannot.
                            What we will do is try. We will attack this problem using that figure as
                            a guide. It is evidence of our forward-looking attitude. It is a guide I
                            have given my officials, and also on the basis of reaching a solution as
                            two family members, against the background of our effort to normalize
                            our relations over a period of two-three years.<note n="6"

                        </p>
                        <p>Let me use this example, in confidence: I have instructed our authorities
                            to see if they can increase Japanese purchases of arms—this is now
                            estimated in the range of $700 million—to make it, say, $850 million. If
                            you say this must take place, and show in the statistics—which aren’t
                            the same in the U.S.—by the end of March, it won’t be possible. What I’m
                            saying is, it can be done in the range of, say, five years.</p>
                        <p>Let me use two more examples: You asked us to liberalize our imports of
                            fresh oranges on a seasonal basis, in Hakone. My officials said no, it
                            was not possible. I asked them to look again, to see if it could be done
                            in a different time period, or with liberalized allocations. These won’t
                            show in the figures by the end of next March. I also asked my officials
                                <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0276"/>about importing a greater
                            quantity of feeder cattle. It is now at 5000 head. We could consider
                            going up perhaps twice or three times that amount, if this is possible
                            to do. Other purchasers are aggressive and competitive, however.</p>
                        <p>There was also another idea floated at Hakone—on mixed blending orange
                            prices—if we could seek an arrangement where the agricultural people on
                            this side—the opponents—can be made a partner on this, with the American
                            partners.</p>

                            in a spirit of friendship. And if you approach it, as you have, in a

                            former Prime Minister—zen sho sru. [The interpreter indicated that it
                            was difficult to translate, but that it was roughly: “I shall look into
                            this, in a judicious and forward-looking manner,” or “in a spirit of
                            goodwill, I will use my greatest efforts to see what can be done.”] If
                            someone says this in the Diet, it is accepted as a statement of a
                            forward-looking attitude—but perhaps not between foreign governments. I
                            want to avoid the misunderstanding, which may have been a problem in the
                            past, by saying that we would aim at a reduction of $1 billion, and
                            trying to indicate to my officials an approach in that sense. So if we
                            cannot come up with a reduction by March 31, I do not wish to be accused
                            of not being good at my word. I meant an order of magnitude, a goal.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s fair enough.
                            On this basis, no misunderstanding can arise.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>: The way to
                            put it is, Japan and the U.S., working both together, mutually try to
                            seek whether they can reduce the trade imbalance to less than $3 billion
                            by the end of the Japanese fiscal year. But some measures, some
                            purchases, mentioned earlier on would not show up in the trade figures
                            by that time.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s understood.
                            That’s understood.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>: What I try
                            to emphasize is that we try to tackle the problem with the best will in
                            the world.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s all we ask.

                        <p>[There was a brief recess from 11:00-11:03 a.m.]</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>: To try to
                            solve this issue before Honolulu, I nominate Mr.
                                <persName>Tsurumi</persName>, Deputy Vice Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs—who has led the Japanese group on this. He can be in touch with

                            the details.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Good. Where shall
                            we make the announcement of this decision—at Honolulu or before?</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>: We would
                            have no strong preference. We should aim at the more effective use of
                            this. Therefore, what is your view?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think we should
                            aim at announcing it at Honolulu.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>: Just the
                            confirmation at Honolulu of the details worked out.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Just confirmation,
                            no details at Honolulu—just confirmation between you and the President
                            of what our Ambassador and your people have worked out.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>: Taking this
                            into consideration, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IRS1"
                                >Ingersoll</persName>, perhaps you can discuss with us the details
                            on timing and wording and content?</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>: It may turn
                            out that as long as we are agreed in advance on what we are planning to
                            announce, perhaps we could announce it before Honolulu—so we could
                            clearly divide it from what we are discussing at Honolulu?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Why don’t we wait
                            til we have a package, and then decide?</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If we can solve the
                            package we can solve the announcement.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>: Yes.</p>

                                Japanese</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The effort to achieve a short-term trade and financial package with the
                            Japanese prior to your Hawaii trip is useful and desirable from several
                            standpoints. At the same time, there is a clear danger that, carried too
                            enthusiastically in certain directions for the sake of the appearance of
                            a harmonious “big package,” our basic continuing economic problem could
                            be aggravated. I find some possibilities under consideration that would
                            be potentially counterproductive by giving a false sense of progress,
                            make it more difficult for the Japanese Government to build the support
                            at home for more fundamental, needed action in the future, and possibly
                            prejudice negotiations in other directions.</p>
                        <p>These dangers can be avoided if we do not fall into the trap of appearing
                            to enthusiastically accept essentially “window dressing” transactions as
                            a substitute for the hard and continuing effort to produce a lasting
                            equilibrium in Japanese (and, thus, U.S.) payments. All efforts should
                            be made to increase the imports from the United States, and to reduce
                            the trade imbalances. However, prepayment should not be an
                            objective.</p>
                        <p>Such payments are of little or no help to us in the short-run, since
                            Japan has no alternative at present to holding dollars in any case. To
                            the extent they relieve pressure for other measures to actually increase
                            imports into Japan, they could be counterproductive to our longer-term
                            efforts.</p>
                        <p>In the strictly financial area, the Japanese have apparently proffered
                            long-term low interest rate loans in yen. These should certainly be
                            rejected for they dig us in a deeper hole and are a bad precedent.
                            Long-term dollar investments are a matter of relative indifference to
                            us, and should not be accepted as a Japanese concession (although we are
                            willing to talk about it when convenient to them).</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Japanese are interested in a statement from the highest
                            levels of the U.S. Government that they can use to help sanctify the
                            present yen-dollar exchange rate. Their pressure poses a problem. On the
                            one hand, realistically, a change in the yen exchange rate may soon be
                            necessary <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0279"/>to achieve balance.
                            On the other hand, in avoiding placing your prestige on the line with
                            respect to the present yen rate, we do not want to give the opposite
                            impression we look to a break-up of the Smithsonian Agreement. Thus, a
                            formula of words must be found that, while supporting the Smithsonian
                            Agreement in general as a useful interim step, avoids a commitment to
                            the specific yen-dollar parity in the future.</p>

                            These officials are loyal to Japanese business and industry interests.
                            Nevertheless, past experience has indicated that we can be most
                            effective by pressing the Japanese Government quietly but firmly to
                            specific commitments that are politically feasible for it domestically.
                            Indeed, US pressure is one of the most effective levers available to a
                            Japanese Prime Minister and the Foreign Office to use with recalcitrant
                            economic bureaucrats. <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName>, with

                                troublesome next year, (b) successfully conclude monetary reform

                                negotiation legislation, we must substantially improve our balance
                                of payments position. Realistically, a major part of the improvement
                                must come vis-à-vis Japan. However, our bilateral trade deficit,
                                which was $3.2 billion in 1971 is projected by us to be about $3.8
                                billion in 1972. (The Japanese are now predicting $3.6 billion.)
                                Japanese Foreign Exchange Reserves rose by over $10 billion in 1971
                                and today are above $16 billion.</p>
                            <p>Japan, for its part, recognizes in principle the necessity of
                                reducing its trade and payments surplus which has made it the target
                                of protectionist pressure in Europe and the U.S. However, the
                                Government and the business community are extremely reluctant to
                                translate this principle into concrete actions which are harmful to
                                specific interests in Japan.</p>

                                Total value: $686 million. In addition Japan projects an estimated
                                increase in agricultural purchases, over last year’s level, of $270
                                million and in purchases of fishery and forestry products of $120

                                aircraft, helicopters—which are being prepaid. These represent real
                                sales for now and the future but except for agricultural purchases
                                these do not help our trade balance this year. The package is an
                                indicator of our mutual effort to turn around the growing imbalance
                                in U.S.-Japanese trade. But its significance in this regard is
                                diminished without a Japanese commitment to reductions in the trade
                                imbalance. Accordingly, it is important that we receive in the joint
                                statement a commitment that Japan intends to reduce by March 31 its
                                trade surplus with the U.S. to below $3 billion, or by an amount of
                                roughly $1 billion from the present projected surplus of $3.8 to $4

                        <p>[Omitted here are an exchange of pleasantries and discussion of the
                            Emperor’s visit to Alaska and of former Prime Minister Sato.]</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then recalled telling Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> recently that constant contact, both official
                            and unofficial, is very important.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that the Prime
                            Minister said this is important in both the political and economic
                            fields.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister recalled, in connection with economics, that he also
                            said Japan must have a strong American economy. The fundamental <pb
                                n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0284"/>view of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> is that American prosperity means
                            Japanese prosperity. While the current economic problems could not be
                            resolved in one move, he expressed the belief that constant
                            communication, with meetings between officials and experts every month
                            if necessary, while keeping watch on long-term trends would lead to a
                            smooth solution satisfactory to both sides.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that one of the reasons he appointed Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_IRS1">Ingersoll</persName> is that we need in
                            Japan a businessman with a good economic background. The Prime Minister,
                            he noted, has not only achieved success in business but has the further
                            qualification of having served as Finance Minister and Minister of
                            International Trade and Industry.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he appreciated the appointment of Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_IRS1">Ingersoll</persName>, who could foresee
                            problems in all aspects of the relationship, not just economic ones. It
                            was, he said, a happy choice, since he is an expert in economic affairs.
                            The Prime Minister said that he knew Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_IRS1">Ingersoll</persName> many years before, having met
                            him through <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">David Kennedy</persName>, when
                            he was still head of Continental Illinois. He noted that he had, as
                            Finance Minister some years ago, approved the establishment of
                            Continental Illinois’ branches in Tokyo and Kobe.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister cautioned that trade negotiations through government
                            channels only tended to develop into item-by-item negotiations, and
                            pointed out that it is more effective to have consultations between
                            specialists, with a view toward expansion of long-term balanced trade to
                            the mutual advantage of both countries. Therefore, he appreciated the
                            fact that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IRS1">Ingersoll</persName>
                            does not confine himself to official contacts with himself and the
                            Foreign Minister, but also speaks broadly to the business community in
                            Japan, which understands him so well.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he knows negotiations to resolve the great
                            imbalance in our trade are difficult. He is glad to hear there is some
                            progress. He also understood that the counterparts are discussing the
                            technical points in the other meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2">The
                                results of the trade negotiation were announced in Honolulu on
                                September 1; see <ref target="#d98fn4">footnote 4, Document
                                98</ref>.</note> He emphasized that a skilled and experienced
                            politician would understand that the present trade imbalance might
                            appear to be advantageous to Japan, but if allowed to grow could lead to
                            rising protectionism in the Congress. We should understand, he said,
                            that it is in our mutual interest to resolve this trade imbalance as
                            much as possible so as to prevent any move toward restriction issues,
                            but rather to provide for freer trade, which is in the interest of both
                            Japan and the United States, which are great economic powers. He
                            realized that some Japanese businessmen, like our own, would <pb n="257"
                                xml:id="pg_257" facs="0285"/>tend to take a negative attitude toward
                            any actions taken which they thought would result in a detriment to
                            their own short-range interests. However, in viewing the long-term, he
                            stressed that we as political leaders must create conditions which
                            encourage the reduction of barriers. This, he said, we can do only if
                            the members of the Diet and of our own Congress are convinced of the
                            long-term interest to both countries of redressing the balance. Japan’s
                            businessmen and manufacturers are competitive and efficient, he said,
                            and our own businessmen and manufacturers have that reputation.
                            Therefore, we should welcome competition, and as political leaders he
                            said both of us should do all we can to see that barriers are not
                            raised. Therefore the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> moves to
                            reduce the present trade imbalance would have, he believed, a salutary
                            effect on both public opinion and in the Congress.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that an excessive imbalance in trade did not
                            serve either nation, and is undesirable. Therefore, he wished to do his
                            best to reduce the current imbalance. Japan would make specific efforts
                            to reduce the imbalance, in order to continue to benefit from expanding
                            trade. However, he did not believe this matter could be solved in half a
                            year, or a year. Having served as Minister of Finance some three years,
                            as an LDP policy-maker, and also as Minister of International Trade and
                            Industry for a year, he felt he is qualified as an expert. While in
                            office, therefore, he said he wishes to bring about an “ideal
                            situation.” While continuing to consult between governments, he said the
                            Government of Japan would also continue its efforts to persuade business
                            to accept necessary measures.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister added that the President’s term of office is four
                            years, but his own term as LDP President is only three.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he is young, the youngest to serve as a Minister
                            and also to serve as Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he was also the youngest man to serve as a
                            Diet member, but pointed out that long life does not depend on
                            chronological age. While the President could serve eight years, he could
                            serve as LDP President only six years (two three-year terms).</p>
                        <p>The President asked if that is all he could serve.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister replied that this is all, unless LDP party regulations
                            are amended, or unless he stepped down after two terms and later ran for
                            another term.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he views Japan-U.S. economic problems as
                            being important. Therefore, he has been meeting with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_IRS1">Ingersoll</persName>, and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_EWD1">Eberle</persName>, and wishes to bring
                            about some conclusion. Japan’s entire post-war economic recovery has
                            been based on the dollar, he said, and therefore the maintenance of the
                            value of the dollar and continued growth of the American economy are <pb
                                n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0286"/>also in the interest of Japan,
                            insomuch as these contribute to the maintenance of world peace and the
                            position of the free world. Japan, he said, wishes to cooperate in the
                            interest of expanding the American economy.</p>
                        <p>The President said this is mutual. A strong, healthy Japanese economy is
                            in our interest. He realized that Japan has a special problem with
                            respect to playing a military role in the Pacific and Asia, but Japanese
                            economic influence could be decisive in many areas. Therefore, it is in
                            our interest that there be a strong, vigorous Japanese economy, so that
                            Japan could play a vital role in Southeast Asia, which would help
                            develop the whole region, and would be decisive. He commented that the
                            Prime Minister would read in the press statements reflecting the feeling
                            by some of our political leaders and businessmen that Japan is a serious
                            competitor to be dealt with, but noted that he does not share their
                            feelings. Healthy competition benefits both nations, he believes,
                            except, of course, when the trade imbalance is too great.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he wished to discuss the healthy balance of
                            trade noted by the President. Within two or three years Japan wishes to
                            restrain its surplus on current account to one percent of <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>, which would be used to finance
                            economic aid of one percent of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> to
                            the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s. Moreover, of that amount the
                            Government of Japan wishes to reach the ideal level of 0.7% of
                            governmental developmental assistance as soon as possible. It is said by
                            some that Japan has attained economic affluence, he said, but this is
                            not true. There is an excessive concentration of population in urban
                            centers, such as Tokyo and Osaka, which gives rise to many problems like
                            pollution and inadequate housing. Japan lags behind the United States in
                            social capital formation, he said, and great investments are needed for
                            social capital and to improve living conditions. Thus, great domestic
                            investments must be made, as well as large contributions to economic
                            assistance to the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s. He said that the
                            Government of Japan hopes to move forward toward realizing both
                            goals.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, the Prime Minister added that Japan should cooperate
                            with the Southeast Asian nations and the ROK in providing both aid and
                            investment. When the tensions in Vietnam have been reduced, he said that
                            Japan should also provide aid and investments to help stabilize the
                            lives of the people. He noted Japan’s promise at <gloss

                        <p>President: This meeting will be devoted to the trade issues relating to
                            the European Community. It will cover these in general but not be
                            specific on particular trade matters. Peter, would you like to start
                            off.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FPM1">Flanigan</persName>: It has been the basic
                            tenet of US foreign policy to support strongly the formation and
                            enlargement of the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>. This was primarily
                                <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0288"/>for political reasons. The
                            economic problems which were raised by the establishment of the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> were not enough to pose a specific threat
                            to us although in the examination of the Rome Treaty several years ago
                            we raised, and still maintain, a variety of objections concerning its
                            compatibility with <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. But recent
                                <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> enlargement and spread of
                            preferences are more questionable legally and more damaging to our trade
                            interests. Bill Eberle has strongly defended our interests. The
                            atmosphere has been one in which the US has been engaged in a growing
                            sense of confrontation with the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>. These
                            can escalate. We are challenging the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>
                            in an effort to limit damage to our interests and obtain cooperation in
                            a broader area. The strategy we engage in has implications for the
                            forthcoming monetary negotiations and our multilateral trade
                            negotiations with Europe next year. We should agree on appropriate
                            responses in dealing with the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>There are three examples of how problems will develop: <list>
                                <item>—The Ten will have to effect a common tariff. We sell $125
                                    million worth of grain to the UK. The <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                        >EC</gloss> will argue that we have been compensated by a
                                    reduction of their tariff on industrial products. We say
                                    “no.”</item>
                                <item>—<gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> preferential arrangements
                                    violate the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. There is an
                                    issue over dealing with arrangements with Spain and Israel. We
                                    have already filed our objections. The issue now is whether we
                                    escalate our objections. Or, should we deal with these as part
                                    of a broader agreement?</item>
                                <item>—In January it will be a <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                                    “open season”. Our tariffs are bound for a three-year period. On
                                    January 1 of next year we have the right to change them or we
                                    can suspend them and see what the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                        >EC</gloss> will do. We need guidance. We must keep in mind
                                    our broader objectives which are to reduce barriers to trade and
                                    contribute to a reduction in tension in our economic, political,
                                    and security interests in Europe.</item>

                                products. We would postpone any development of any major negotiating
                                position until after the election. This assumes that France has
                                maximum leverage at this point and the <gloss target="#t_CAP1"
                                    >CAP</gloss> is popular in certain quarters of Germany. We would
                                wait until the climate is better and not develop a strategy at this
                                time.</item>

                                this we would lay the groundwork in the economic and political area
                                for a possible major political initiative next year. Unlike Option
                                A, this adds a definitive positive cost to the way we move over the
                                next few months. We would ease <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261"
                                    facs="0289"/>off of confrontations which are harmful to the
                                climate and avoid rocking the boat, but this would allow current
                                actions by the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> against our trade
                                interests to proceed unchecked.</item>
                            <item>—C. <hi rend="italic">Modified confrontation.</hi> Continue to
                                defend interests strongly and bring many problems to a head but stop
                                short of bringing issues to a <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                                vote, which we would probably lose. We could deal with major issues
                                at a Summit. We would press for solution of some issues even at the
                                risk of damaging relations. This could be combined with Option B. In
                                our negotiations on <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> enlargement we
                                would attempt to get compensation on grain or we could unilaterally
                                unbind tariffs.</item>
                            <item>—D. <hi rend="italic">Precipitate a crisis.</hi> This is based on
                                the premise that meaningful solutions cannot be reached unless there
                                is an atmosphere of impending crisis. This would obviously bring us
                                into major confrontation with the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>
                                and spill over into other aspects of our relationship if we cannot
                                get the solutions we want.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>In interagency discussions all parties felt we should vigorously promote
                            US interests. Some felt we should do so to the point of confrontation.
                            Others preferred combining Option B and Option C, which was to work more
                            toward a cooperative approach. All felt this should be developed as part
                            of a broader US-European relationship.</p>
                        <p>President: What do you think of this, Bill?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EWD1">Eberle</persName>: It is imperative for us
                            to carry the major share of the initiative. The <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss> is not able to do so. We cannot step back. We must carry
                            things through if anything is to be done. Option C permits us to do this
                            and get a major feel for the atmosphere in which these negotiations will

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EWD1">Eberle</persName>: I am “bearish” about

                                >CAP</gloss> costs more than the total contribution of agriculture
                            to Europe’s <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>. The Germans and French
                            have made “backdoor” suggestions that we all agree in Article XXIV
                            negotiations that there is some trade damage from the <gloss
                                target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss> and then carry over this agreement to
                            the comprehensive negotiations in settlement. There are forces starting
                            to build up. We should keep pressure on. There is hope. The Europeans
                            feel we should not back away. If we back away, it takes away support
                            from those in the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> who agree with
                            us.</p>
                        <p>President: Will the new <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> be lined up
                            against us?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EWD1">Eberle</persName>: We should assume this.
                            Today the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> is isolated in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> on the question of enlargement. The
                            key issue is whether they <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0290"/>will
                            accept more economic cooperation with North America or whether they will
                            back away.</p>
                        <p>President: Nationalism in Europe is stronger than nationalism in the US
                            and it is damned strong here. They enjoy kicking the US around.
                            Eighty-eight percent of all the European media is violently anti-US.
                            They will cut their own throats economically to take us on politically.
                            We cannot get a very liberal trade program through the US. On these
                            issues our people are very nationalistic.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EWD1">Eberle</persName>: Nationalism is stronger
                            in Europe against Japan than against the US.</p>
                        <p>President: We need to consider possible Congressional reaction to our
                            failure to press our trade interests. Nationalist pressures are strong
                            pressures in Congress. The Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations
                            Committees are unrepresentative. They only represent their own
                            Committees. The Foreign Affairs Committee is a little more
                            representative. But they do not represent the feelings of the country.
                            We can’t get too far out in front of our constituents. They are very
                            tough on trade. These feelings are strong not only in the labor movement
                            but among a large segment of the business community.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>: In Europe there are
                            different nationalisms—German, French, and British nationalisms, and on
                            monetary policy they sometimes differ. There are different opinions in
                            different countries.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>: It is sort of a mixed-up
                            nationalism. The question is, are they supporting the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> or individual nations. Trade questions
                            will be decided on what is good for everybody. Our position has to be
                            the one that Bill Eberle outlined. Elements of Option B could be
                            combined with C. If we offer to liberalize, it will have a domestic
                            problem. Our dairy policy is the same as the <gloss target="#t_CAP1"
                                >CAP</gloss>. If we appear willing to make concessions on
                            agricultural policy the dairy farmers would go up in smoke.</p>
                        <p>President: Let there be no doubt that our position before the election is
                            one of protectionism. We should not indicate that we are preparing any
                            concession not in the interest of the US. If anyone does, we will
                            repudiate it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RKW1">Rush</persName>: The Europeans protect their
                            domestic interests and their bloc interests. Both European and
                            individual country nationalism is against the US.</p>
                        <p>President: What is your opinion of the nature of the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> nationalism—European or individual.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FPM1">Flanigan</persName>: When they can do
                            something to protect their national interests they will. When they can’t
                            do it on their own (e.g. the development of aerospace industry) they
                            will do it as a group. For instance, they are developing an industrial
                            policy. We should resist the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> effort
                                <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0291"/>to subsidize particular
                            industries or develop high technology industries through preferential
                            arrangements.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PPG1">Peterson</persName>: We should confront the
                            Europeans. If we appear to be liberalizing now, Burke-Hartke pressure is
                            likely to develop. We must recognize that there is a security aspect to
                            our relationship. On security and military, the Europeans have the best
                            of both worlds. Trade issues will have to be related to larger issues
                            including our military relationship. They need to be played at the
                            Presidential level. If they fear we will abandon our military support,
                            it will affect the way they deal on trade matters.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>: They are not about to
                            change the <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss>. To change the <gloss
                                target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss> would cause serious problems for them
                            as governments. Likewise, there are preferential trade issues and
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> non-applicants
                            which are important to them. At the moment they are only problems of
                            principle for us, but do not hurt us badly. The question of a trade
                            bloc, however, is a serious problem. It will have to be dealt with in
                            the larger context of trade negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The question is how much do we want to threaten them with them in public.
                            Do we want to go so far as to threaten withdrawal of concessions. This
                            causes many problems. We should not do this in the next two months. We
                            have a strong case but they have some problems with us too. It is not
                            fair to assume they do not have complaints too. Our policy should be
                            tough without any specific threats. We should hit them with a general
                            position but without specific threats. We should also get them to adopt
                            a structure in which we can negotiate with them on a regular basis.</p>
                        <p>President: In the following months we should not say anything forthcoming
                            on trade. For example, my speech to the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> meeting will not be forthcoming on trade matters.<note

                        <p>However, more is involved here than just questions of “horse-trading”
                            between soybeans and cheese. The question is what Europe wants its
                            position to be vis-à-vis the US and the Soviet Union. We hear about
                            Finlandization of Europe. If Europe should adopt a trade policy which is
                            anti-US, it could affect attitudes in the US—bring about an
                            unenthusiastic attitude toward Europe—and will carry over into the
                            political area. There will be pressure to withdraw divisions and NATO
                            would come apart. The idea that Europe can defend itself without the US
                            is “bull”. If NATO comes apart, they will be an economic giant but a
                            military and political pigmy. The USSR will encroach on them. It will
                            not be in the traditional way but a new-style invasion. European leaders
                            are <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0292"/>terrified at that prospect.
                            European leaders want to “screw” us and we want to “screw” them in the
                            economic area. But political relationships should be overriding for us
                            and for them. What will matter in trade is its relationship to the total
                            problem—what we want our relationship with Europe to be. Between now and
                            the election we should say nothing, but we should give careful thought
                            about how trade relations fit in the context of our overall relations.
                            We should examine what price we might have to pay on the trade side for
                            this political relationship, and they should do so as well. We should
                            not allow the umbilical cord between the US and Europe to be cut and
                            Europe to be nibbled away by the Soviets. We need to strengthen the
                            bonds of trade, monetary relations, exchanges, etc. As an example of
                            what I mean, you recall that when the Soviet runner won the 100 meter
                            race in the Olympics he said that the race marked the end of an era and
                            now the Europeans are the best. Basically this is just racism, since
                            they are white and our sprinters are black, but the idea of Europe
                            versus the US is a Soviet line. This was an example of a new style, with
                            the Soviets trying to identify themselves with the Europeans and against
                            the US. Brezhnev and Kosygin say almost the same things.</p>
                        <p>All non-Communist countries in Europe do not want to come under that
                            influence. They know we have divisions and nuclear weapons. It is easy
                            for us to say we will take them out of Europe, but it is definitely not
                            in our interest to do so. Chayes goes around Europe talking about
                            removal of troops, and every time Americans see us take a bad rap in
                            basketball or something they remember. This contributes to the growing
                            sentiment in the US such as “damn the Europeans” and the “foreigners are
                            doing us in”. It is true that the foreigners are doing bad things to us
                            and we should do some bad things to them. But we must be under no
                            illusions. We cannot turn isolationist in the broader context.</p>
                        <p>If we were only looking at trade, we could get along without the
                            Europeans or the rest of the world since trade is much less important to
                            our <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> than to theirs. Trade is the
                            froth on top of the beer, but beer without froth does not taste too bad.
                            But we need to look at the bigger picture. For instance, we should treat
                            Japan with tender loving care because what Europe would become to the
                            Soviets, Japan to China would be even more. Trade is important
                            politically. Trade relationships can benefit political relationships,
                            although wars have been fought between countries with trading
                            relationships with one another. Our interests are served by being as
                            tough as we can without going over the line where anti-US sentiment will
                            cause them to turn against us and break with us. The Europeans recognize
                            that they do not matter in the world any more. They know it. Economic
                            issues are the things they now <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0293"
                            />concentrate on. They are big for them and small for us. That means we
                            will probably have to give more than our interest, strictly construed,
                            would require. However, for the moment we should let the Europeans know
                            that there are a lot of Americans who would welcome our getting out of
                            Europe, and Japan. But we are fighting this. The Europeans should
                            realize why. It is not because our economic survival is at stake but
                            rather because we have a major interest in our overall relations with
                            them, which we value highly, and in the interest of world peace.</p>
                        <p>The whole area of our economic relations affects our leverage position in
                            the world. In the future our relations will have a larger economic
                            content. This will require more subtlety in the way we conduct our
                            overall relations. We are best to play this game. We are the strongest.
                            However, this is not the time to decide this. After the elections is the
                            time. Then we can do what we have to do. It is going to be very hard to
                            sell trade liberalization to the Congress and the people. We need to
                            make a strong case. We will be prepared to do it because we know that
                            more is at stake than just trade, because our interests require it. But
                            for now we should not talk in public about the political-commercial
                            tradeoff.</p>

                            political-commercial tradeoff?</p>
                        <p>President: There obviously is a link between economics and
                            political-security issues, but we should not link it openly now.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PPG1">Peterson</persName>: What are the
                            possibilities for a longer term political-security link, and the
                            prospects for selling a liberalization bill to the Congress?</p>
                        <p>President: We need good results in the election and we can get a lot
                            done. We are looking to get a majority. A majority has not happened
                            since 1956. It is difficult for a Republican to get a landslide; a
                            majority will be important. With that we can make a major move to
                            propose what is best for the country and try to educate the country so
                            that it sees the issues in the broader context. It takes time for people
                            to understand an issue like this, but they will come around. What is at
                            stake here is a major shift in the world balance of power, particularly
                            among ourselves, the Russians, the Chinese, and the Japanese. As regards
                            Europe, they will have one hell of a time acting as a bloc. They do not
                            get along with each other. The French don’t get along with the Germans,
                            the Germans don’t get along with the British. It will be some time
                            before they can learn to act as a group. This means we have to work with
                            the heads of Government in the various countries and not that jackass in
                            the European Commission in Brussels.<note n="5" xml:id="d100fn5"

                            long-range relations. We have to tie this in with the whole problem of
                            what we want our relations with Europe to be. Europeans are used to
                            thinking internationally. They argue about Tanzania and their other
                            relations abroad. We have to think internationally. We are it in the
                            Free World. We would be missing a great opportunity if we do not see the
                            broad picture and have such a picture to guide us. Then we can educate
                            the people to support that kind of policy. But they should see how it
                            affects their own self interests.</p>

                            suggestions should be kept private and not reduce things to writing.
                            They should be discussed orally. If we do have a study made, it will get
                            out.</p>
                        <p>President: Yes, controversial memoranda are likely to leak. Like the
                            grain deal. You remember how hard we tried to keep the amounts secret.
                            Now we are accused of having told the companies. It is ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>Everyone should be thinking of how we should achieve what we have talked

                            on where the European Community was going, both in its internal
                            development of common agricultural, industrial and monetary policies and
                            in the continued proliferation of preferential trading arrangements
                            going well beyond Europe. We stressed that the seeming lack of concern
                            on the part of Europeans for the difficulties which their actions caused
                            for the United States could have dangerous political repercussions. We
                            particularly voiced concern over the Commission’s proposed Mediterranean
                            policy which is to be presented to the Council next Monday. We said that
                            the most important move, both symbolically and practically, they could
                            make to reassure the US was to drop the reverse preference provisions
                            from these and other preferential agreements. We stressed the importance
                            of <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0296"/>obtaining positive signals
                            from the Europeans of a willingness to approach these real issues

                            helpful signal, we said, would be a positive declaration on US-European
                            relations at the European Summit.</p>

                            States. They said this would be balanced by statements from individual
                            governments around the Summit which would be more forthcoming. I said
                            the need was for a statement from the Summit itself, not from friends in
                            the corridor, of willingness to work with the United States in
                            reordering economic relations through multilateral negotiations on
                            monetary reform and trade liberalization. I also expressed the hope that
                            the Summit can avoid an inflexible position on continuing <gloss

                            make it difficult for us to hold the line against our own protectionist
                            pressures and move toward a liberalizing negotiation. In connection with

                            rapidly, we expressed concern over plans to restructure the European
                            aircraft industry in a manner which may hurt an important American
                            export. The <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> side took note of this
                            position, but referred obliquely to our recent action on the GE-SNECMA
                            case as seeming to preclude the possibility of joint ventures with the
                            United States in the aviation industry and, therefore, forcing them to
                            combine among themselves to achieve sufficient size and strength to
                            compete with US firms.<note n="4" xml:id="d102fn4">Reference is to the

                            <persName corresp="#p_DRG1">Dahrendorf</persName> described the proposed
                                <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> Mediterranean policy to be
                            considered by the Council of Ministers as required to deal with the
                            economic problems of the Mediterranean countries caused by the
                            enlargement of the Community and as furthering political interests
                            common to <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0297"/>Europe and the US.
                            Bill Eberle and I made clear that the US favors strengthening the
                            political and economic ties between the Community and the Mediterranean
                            countries as a contribution to the stability in the area. What the
                            United States objects to is the discriminatory aspects of this policy,
                            especially the reverse preferences which can only be interpreted in this
                            country as the continuation of a policy of forming a large preferential
                            bloc around the Community. As a result of this exchange, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DRG1">Dahrendorf</persName> has a clearer picture of the
                            objectionable feature of the proposed Mediterranean policy.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Community’s free-trade arrangements with the <gloss
                                target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> neutrals, we made clear we expect a
                            thorough examination in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and
                            action to protect American interests. We cited paper and other
                            industries as likely to be injured unless the Community takes offsetting
                            action. <persName corresp="#p_DRG1">Dahrendorf</persName> indicated that
                            there was a growing realization in the Community that something would
                            have to be done for the US and other third countries as a result of the
                            Community’s arrangement with the <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the two sides held a useful discussion of preparations for
                            multilateral trade negotiations. Bill Eberle outlined in general terms
                            the state of preparations in this country and the timetable we expect to
                            follow leading towards the opening of multilateral negotiations in
                            September of 1973. He stressed the need for expeditious action on the
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> procedures under Article 24
                            with respect to <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> enlargement so that
                            these issues could be disposed of before the beginning of multilateral
                            negotiations. It was agreed that there would have to be further meetings
                            to consult on the content of the respective negotiating authorities of
                            the US and the Community to insure that they are mutually
                            reinforcing.</p>
                        <p>The main area we were not able to discuss was energy. Commissioner
                            Haferkamp who is responsible for energy matters was unable to come at
                            the last minute in part because he was still in the process of gaining
                            Commission approval for a new policy on energy. Because I believe this
                            will be a particularly important area for US-<gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss> cooperation in the near future, I hope to be able to
                            meet with Haferkamp to discuss the energy situation sometime in the
                            coming weeks.</p>
                        <p>In sum, these meetings met the objectives we set for ourselves and
                            provided us with an opportunity—coming before the Summit—to get our
                            views across to the Commission on the main current issues in our
                            relationship. By the end of our meetings the European representatives
                            recognized that the US was seriously disturbed over the manner in which
                            the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> was handling the <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> aspects of enlargement and the
                            preferential trade aspects of arrangements with non-member
                            countries.</p>

                                <p>The net result of the consultations confirms your conviction that
                                    the Community, and particularly its bureaucracy in Brussels, is
                                    determined to maximize its economic potential regardless of the
                                    cost to the United States and the Atlantic system. While paying
                                    lip service to the importance of Atlantic unity, specific
                                    decisions are resolved in favor of the Community and contrary to
                                    the interests of the United States. Examples of this, that were
                                    put forth at last week’s meeting, were decisions by the
                                    Commission to propose to the Community governments (a) a
                                    Mediterranean policy and (b) an industrial policy.</p>
                                <p>The Mediterranean policy is based on perceived special political
                                    and economic interests between the Community and the countries
                                    of the Mediterranean basin. The policy would be implemented by
                                    special technological and assistance programs and by trade
                                    preferences. Clearly the latter exacerbate the discrimination
                                    against current U.S. agricultural exports, and potential
                                    industrial exports to the Community. Potentially more harmful
                                    would be extension of reverse preferences given by developing
                                    Mediterranean countries to the Community, which have even less
                                    justification.</p>
                                <p>The Commission’s proposed industrial policy uses protectionist
                                    devices, such as R&amp;D subsidies, to foster high technology
                                    industries in Europe. This is particularly designed to
                                    strengthen Europe’s commercial airplane and computer industries,
                                    both being areas of strong U.S. technological dominance and
                                    exports.</p>

                                    a course of action contrary to the U.S. economic interest.
                                    Happily, with the enlargement of the Community to nine, plus the
                                    elections in Germany and Holland, a new Commission will be
                                    formed shortly after the first of the year. <persName

                                <p>If we are to be successful in deflecting the Community from its
                                    current course, and in creating a climate in which we can reach
                                    meaningful agreement in the broader areas of monetary and trade
                                    reforms, we must develop viable solutions to the two major
                                        US-<gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> problems, the Common
                                    Agricultural Policy and the Community’s growing number of
                                    Preference Agreements with non-Community countries.</p>
                                <p>Regarding preferences, every effort will be made to get agreement
                                    from the Community not to extend preferences to additional
                                    countries, though this horse is largely out of the barn.</p>
                                <p>With regard to preferences already granted to developed
                                    countries, largely European, our policy should be to (a) in the
                                    short run, get special tariff relief where an existing U.S.
                                    industry is hurt, such as our wood products industry, whose $600
                                    million of annual exports to the Community are in danger, and
                                    (b) in the long run, reduce industrial tariffs multilaterally so
                                    that the tariff preferences are ineffective against U.S.
                                    exports.</p>
                                <p>With regard to the Community’s preferences for developing
                                    countries, these should be subsumed in a multilateral program of
                                    generalized <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0300"
                                    />preferences, which the U.S. already supports. Reverse
                                    preferences, however, which are of no benefit to the developing
                                    countries, should be phased out. Several Community members have
                                    evidenced sympathy for this position. For these developing
                                    countries to which the Community wants to show a special
                                    interest, it can undertake a special program of aid, investment
                                    and technological assistance. So long as this special program
                                    does not include additional trade preferences which discriminate
                                    against the United States, this country would have no reason to
                                    object—rather it would applaud.</p>
                                <p>In the area of agriculture, the U.S. could direct its rhetoric
                                    more at international agricultural trade than at the Community’s
                                    overall agricultural policy, which they consider to be an
                                    internal matter, though this is only a semantic difference. The
                                    Europeans must indicate a willingness, first, to reduce their
                                    subsidies to agricultural exports to third markets, and
                                    subsequently to reduce the protection in the future against
                                    agricultural imports into the Community. These, rather than a
                                    Common Agricultural Policy, are our rightful goals and could
                                    possibly be attainable.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_FPM1">Flanigan</persName> feels that the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> is determined to maximize its economic
                            potential regardless of the cost to the US and the Atlantic system.
                            Specific decisions are resolved in favor of the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss> and contrary to US interests. Examples are (a) the
                            Commission’s proposal for a Mediterranean policy which would include
                            trade preferences and (b) an <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>
                            industrial policy. The former exacerbates the discrimination against US
                            agricultural exports and contains provisions for reverse preferences
                            which discriminate against American exports to Mediterranean countries.
                            The proposed industrial policy also contains protectionist devices,
                            particularly in behalf of Europe’s commercial airplane and computer
                            industries.</p>
                        <p>Membership of the Commission—now dedicated to action contrary to the US
                            economic interests—should change. <persName corresp="#p_MSL2"
                                >Mansholt</persName> will be replaced as President by a Frenchman.
                            Britain, Ireland and Denmark will also have Commissioners. It will be
                            important to schedule a quiet but high-level visit to Brussels to meet
                            with all the new Commissioners shortly after they are installed and
                            visit the new Governments in Bonn and the Hague to attempt to develop a
                            common position on our relationship with the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>We must develop viable solutions to the two major US-<gloss
                                target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> problems: the Common Agricultural Policy
                            and <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> preferential arrangements with
                            non-Community countries. On the latter the “horse is largely out of the
                            barn.” Our policy should be (a) in the short run to get special tariff
                            relief where a US industry is hurt, (b) in the long run to reduce
                            industrial tariffs multilaterally so that tariff preferences do not
                            discriminate against US exports. Preferences for developing countries
                            should be subsumed under a multilateral program of generalized
                            preferences, which the US supports. Reverse preferences should be phased
                            out. The <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>’s development contribution to
                            the developing countries should be made through special programs of aid,
                            investment, and technical assistance.</p>
                        <p>In the area of agriculture the US should concentrate more on
                            international agricultural trade rather than attacking the Community’s
                            agricultural policy, which they consider to be an internal matter. The
                            Europeans <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0302"/>must indicate a
                            willingness to reduce subsidies to agricultural exports and reduce the
                            protection against agricultural imports into the Community.</p>
                        <p>The strategy for our economic relations with Europe can be only a part of
                            our overall relations. As agreed in the <gloss target="#t_CIEP1"

                        </p>
                        <p>We believe Flanigan’s view of European attitudes is oversimplified. There
                            are plenty of people in Europe, if not in the Commission then in top
                            spots in various Western Governments, of whom it cannot be fairly said
                            that they are “determined to maximize economic potential regardless of
                            the cost to the US and the Atlantic system.” There are on both sides of
                            the Atlantic important and senior leaders and officials who are eager to
                            find a way to manage our admitted economic problems in ways that will
                            not destroy those common interests we share.</p>
                        <p>Purely economic “solutions” in most cases (especially regarding
                            fundamental issues such as preferential arrangements and agriculture)
                            may be impossible without a heavy political component. The Mediterranean
                            and Africa are cases in point. It is we, after all, who have urged the
                            Europeans to raise their sights and assume responsibilities around the
                            world which we no longer can or should assume to the extent we used to.
                            However, it is true that so far the Europeans seem bent on doing so
                            almost exclusively by economic and commercial devices, which are
                            discriminatory in nature and are bound to bring them into conflict with
                            those responsible for our economic affairs and with potent US economic
                            interest groups.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The European Community seems intent on continuing to proliferate
                            preferential trading arrangements with non-member countries which are
                            contrary both to the non-discriminatory trading principles we favor and
                            to specific U.S. trading interests. We have consistently stated that we
                            will object to any of these arrangements which are inconsistent with
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and that, where our trade
                            interests are damaged, we will seek specific compensation. These
                            arrangements include (1) existing ones with the <gloss target="#t_EFTA1"
                                >EFTA</gloss> non-applicants, (2) existing ones with former colonial
                            states, (3) existing ones with Greece and Turkey, (4) proposed new
                            arrangements with Mediterranean states and others, and (5) existing
                            arrangements with Spain and Israel which are special cases.</p>
                        <p>On the agreements with Spain and Israel, there is general inter-agency
                            agreement that we should, as we have told the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss>, Spain and Israel we would, invoke the procedures of
                            Article 23(1) of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. In doing so
                            we would propose that the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>, Spain and
                            Israel make adjustments to the agreements to eliminate or greatly reduce
                            the discrimination against U.S. exports, and to the extent that U.S.
                            trade continues to suffer damage we would seek compensatory duty
                            reductions on other products of interest to the U.S. The claim of U.S.
                            trade damage resulting from the agreements should be both defensible and
                            substantial enough to demonstrate the seriousness of our concern over
                            this discrimination against U.S. trade interests so to act as a
                            deterrent to the further proliferation of preferential arrangements.

                        <p>The European Community sees its agreements with Spain and Israel as part
                            of its general policy to strengthen its political and economic ties in
                            the Mediterranean. The agreements are intended to promote trade with
                            Spain and Israel and contribute to the latter nation’s economic
                            development. Finally, the two trade arrangements are considered to be
                            the inevitable consequence of preferences which the European Community
                            has granted to former colonies (Morocco and Tunisia) and NATO members
                            (Greece and Turkey) in the Mediterranean area.</p>

                            Full membership in the European Community is regarded by the Spanish as
                            essential for promoting modernization and liberalization. The current
                            preferential arrangement is seen as a big step toward full membership.

                            its lack of ties with its Middle East neighbors and as a means to

                            Neither side has been able to persuade a sufficient number of the <gloss

                        <p>We have notified the European Community, Spain and Israel that we will

                        </p>
                        <p>The Departments of State and Treasury have reached agreement that the
                            United States should claim that, with limited exceptions, its trade will
                            be adversely affected in cases where the preference margin is four
                            percent or more and U.S. exports to the participants have amounted to
                            $50,000 a year or more. On this basis, we would ask the participants to
                            make adjustments in the agreements or provide compensatory benefits
                            covering approximately $750 million of trade. An initial claim of this
                            magnitude will demonstrate the seriousness of U.S. objections to these
                            and other special and reverse preference arrangements. However, the
                            course we advocate involves serious political risks. Our demands are
                            likely to be met with shock and resentment by the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss>, Spain and Israel. Particularly in Spain and Israel our
                            claims will touch sensitive political nerves and sharp reactions are
                            possible. We should also realize there is virtually no chance that the
                            participants will agree to offsetting trade concessions of this size. In
                            part this would be because the other parties would argue that our
                            initial claim was completely “theoretical” and that even a generous
                            estimate of the potential real damage to our trade would have to be far
                            smaller. If we desire to reach agreement on concrete measures of
                            importance to United States <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0306"
                            />exports, we shall have to be prepared to settle for less, and probably
                            substantially less, than the full claim. Even if our main purpose is to
                            maintain pressure on the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> in
                            preparation for the 1973 trade negotiations, it may be advisable, in
                            order to avoid a confrontation getting out of control, to signal at an
                            appropriate moment a willingness to retreat from our initial claim.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>There are a succession of retreat positions that we could adopt during
                            the negotiations to reduce the amount of our bill and increase the
                            possibility—although limited—for a satisfactory settlement.</p>
                        <p>The first retreat position would be to drop from our bill commodities
                            covered by the European Community’s system of generalized preferences.
                            Exclusion of these commodities would reduce our claim to around $500
                            million.</p>
                        <p>The second retreat position would be to limit our claim to the trade
                            damage caused or likely to be caused by reverse preferences (preferences
                            which the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> enjoys in Spain and Israel)
                            and hard-core special preference items, such as citrus, where we can
                            make our most convincing case of actual damage. On this basis, over $300
                            million of U.S. exports to Spain, around $40 million to Israel and about
                            $22 million to the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> would be listed by
                            the U.S. as adversely affected by the most objectionable feature of the
                            agreements. We would indicate that we would be prepared to settle for
                            tariff adjustments by Spain and Israel to eliminate the discrimination
                            against U.S. goods which benefit the European Community or for
                            compensation benefiting U.S. trade interests through changes in European
                            Community tariffs.</p>

                        <p>There are serious economic and political risks involved in whatever
                            action or combination of actions we might take.</p>
                        <p>The proposed initial U.S. impairment claim against the European
                            Community, Spain and Israel covering three-quarters of a billion dollars
                            of trade will be seen by these parties and others as a frontal attack by
                            the United States against the agreements. They will think our objective
                            is not offsetting trade concessions but the abrogation of the
                            agreements. The United States is likely to be accused of attempting to
                            block Spain’s integration into Europe and of having suddenly reduced its
                            concern for the welfare of Israel. The European Community might become
                            less cooperative on matters of general importance to the United States,
                            such as the forthcoming multilateral trade negotiations.</p>
                        <p>These risks can probably be reduced or controlled by quiet diplomacy, and
                            by a skillful negotiator, particularly if armed with authority <pb
                                n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0307"/>to retreat to the fallback
                            positions described above when he deems it necessary. However, Spain,
                            Israel or the European Community may choose to make a major public issue
                            of the matter. On the other hand, if the United States does not submit a
                            substantial claim, the impression may be created that our objections to
                            special preferential arrangements, while firmly held, will not be backed
                            by determined action.</p>

                            implementing it. He referred to the <gloss target="#t_NSSM1"
                                >NSSM</gloss> 164 exercise as kicking off the first phase, which
                            must be carried out in Washington, and concluded “that we are putting

                        <p>At several points in his November 27 memorandum <persName

                                    solve our growing economic problems. It must, in all likelihood
                                    originate with the President of the United States.</item>
                                <item>“2. The strategy must take a long-term view in order to give
                                    the relationship a sense of durability and permanence. We might
                                    seek a long-term, perhaps 10 years, compact or covenant of a
                                    cross-sectoral nature in which agreements on trade, defense,
                                    energy, monetary and other policies would be pulled together and
                                    which we would articulate a new set of principles to govern our
                                    relationship—a new Atlantic Charter, as it were.</item>
                                <item>“3. In putting together any such comprehensive agreement, we
                                    must play our negotiating cards where they have the greatest
                                    impact—not administrative cubby holes. I suspect that our best
                                    trump card could be long-term security agreements.</item>
                                <item>“4. Our strategy should also involve a realistic ordering of
                                    economic priorities so that, when the trading starts, we will be
                                    in a position to get the trade-offs which maximize the return to
                                    us. In the past, we have scattered our economic negotiating
                                    shots too much.</item>
                                <item>“5. Our strategy should be to seek agreement on some joint
                                    policies for dealing with the growing energy shortage. The
                                    incentive for such agreement should be strong since the United
                                    States and Europe both have interest in avoiding cut-throat
                                    competition either for energy or for foreign exchange earnings
                                    to pay for the energy.</item>
                                <item>“6. Our strategy must take note of the danger that our new
                                    commercial relationships with Eastern Europe and the Soviet
                                    Union could <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0309"/>serve as a
                                    wedge between us and our traditional Western European allies.
                                    Participations for European capital in some of our Soviet energy
                                    ventures could help avert this. Using additional trade with
                                    Eastern Europe as a political lever to achieve joint objectives
                                    is still another thing we should do.</item>
                                <item>“7. The strategy might look toward far broader forms of
                                    cooperation between the U.S. and Europe, cooperation in areas
                                    such as medicine, drug control, crime, transportation and
                                    pollution abatement.</item>
                                <item>“8. Finally, in our approach, we must examine closely the need
                                    for new institutions and new methods of consultation to meet the
                                    problems of the 1970s and avoid the apathy and even hostility
                                    that is building up on both sides.”</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PPG1">Peterson</persName>’s memorandum then
                            developed each of the eight points in greater detail. On the economic
                            side he thought U.S. and European economic interests were not in
                            conflict in the long run, but that in the short term Europe sought trade
                            advantages and responded to political needs that were frictions in the
                            relationship. He expressed his concerns about a coming energy crisis
                            with “massive” U.S., European, and Japanese energy trade deficits that

                            a “cannibalistic scramble not only for energy but for export earnings to

                        <p>On December 1, 1972, in Key Biscayne, Florida, Press Secretary Ron
                            Ziegler announced on the President’s behalf that <persName

                            be “the focal point and the overall coordinator of the entire economic

                                <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>’ duties as Assistant

                                >Shultz</persName> noted that the Council on International Economic

                        <p>Developments in the US, meanwhile, create uncertainties and concerns
                            among the Western Europeans: Congressional efforts to reduce US forces
                            in Europe, increased preoccupation with domestic issues, balance of
                            payments problems, budgetary stringencies, and the appearance of growing
                            isolationism and protectionism are seen as affecting US policies toward
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of subjects unrelated to economic policy.]</p>
                        <p>Economic problems on both sides of the Atlantic, deriving in part from
                            domestic concerns, exert serious pressure on US-European relations
                            generally and US-<gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> relations
                            specifically. In the United States, there is major concern about
                            unemployment, and many fear that the US is losing its competitiveness in
                            international markets, that US corporate giants are exporting jobs
                            through their investments in Europe, and that American industry will
                            suffer from waves of cheap goods from Asia. There is growing sentiment
                            that other countries have been dealing unfairly with us in the economic
                            field to their own advantage. The conclusion by the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> of preferential trade agreements with a
                            widening circle of countries has fed this sentiment. An important
                            complaint also has been the Community’s protectionist agricultural
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>European economic concerns also are affecting our relationships. While
                            Europe experiences unabated strong inflation, some countries and regions
                            continue to suffer from economic stagnation. Europeans, too, are chafing
                            under the accumulation of unneeded and inconvertible dollars, which add
                            to inflationary pressures and nullify monetary policies. Resentment over
                            American private investment is rising. Europeans <pb n="284"
                                xml:id="pg_284" facs="0312"/>see the US as adopting aggressive
                            foreign economic policies. They complain about our tough application of
                            anti-dumping and countervailing duty provisions. More importantly, they
                            continue to fear that the US seeks to extort unilateral trade
                            concessions by our preponderant leverage in the monetary field.</p>

                        <p>Americans and Western Europeans both have the same overriding economic
                            goal of maximizing their prosperity. The open, interdependent economic
                            system, with free movement of goods and services has been an important
                            element of Atlantic economic prosperity. It is important to restate this
                            basic goal because government policies which affect economic conditions
                            on one side of the ocean will also affect the other. An atmosphere of
                            orderly international cooperation is as important to maintain business
                            confidence as is a climate of sound domestic management.</p>
                        <p>American business has done well within this open system and now has a
                            very large economic stake in Western Europe. US direct and indirect

                            amount to some $36 billion. Western Europe is also our largest customer.

                            total exports.</p>
                        <p>In other words, despite some important problems and irritants, we have
                            had and have a highly profitable economic relationship overall with

                        </p>
                        <p>The 1971 monetary crisis represented the culmination of several major
                            trends, especially the serious, long-term balance of payments problem.
                            That crisis was brought to an end by the Smithsonian agreement, but the
                            international payments imbalance persists despite the fact that the US
                            now has better control over its inflation than Europe. The Western
                            Europeans at present have the choice of continuing to accept
                            non-convertible US dollars, changing their exchange rates in our favor,
                            and/or instituting capital controls. The US economy is not seriously
                            hampered by the continued payments deficit. However, progress towards a
                            new system must be made to avoid further financial crises which could
                            seriously undermine business confidence and lead to governmental
                            restrictions on trade and capital movements. In order for the US to
                            restore some form of convertibility, however, all the other elements of
                            the system must be compatible. Most importantly, it must provide for
                            satisfactory adjustment by surplus and deficit countries.</p>
                        <p>Here is perhaps the single most important area of potential tension
                            between the US and Europe. The Western European countries, which are
                            more dependent on exports than the United States, have been accustomed
                            to growth based upon increased exports and would tend to resist measures
                            or rules that would erode their export surplus, which has ensured high
                            levels of employment. Yet they will have to move in this direction if
                            they wish to end the present situation which is so psychologically
                            frustrating to them.</p>
                        <p>Because we are dealing with an area of extreme domestic sensitivity to
                            Western Europeans and Americans alike, such as jobs and farm income, the
                            task of constructing a new and equitable monetary system will require
                            skill. A complicating feature is that the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss> members have committed themselves to the goals of
                            achieving economic and monetary union (EMU), but are only on the
                            threshold of this development. In the short run, <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss> moves towards EMU may complicate the task of achieving a
                            new world system. In the longer run, if the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss> members can adopt a genuine single currency area through
                            harmonization of policies, it may facilitate the adjustment process
                            between the US and them.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The vast bulk of our trade moves in a liberal, open system. More than
                            ever trade flows are responsive to economic and business conditions on
                            both sides of the ocean.</p>
                        <p>The most important exception, of course, is agriculture where the
                            Community’s Common Agricultural Policy has been protectionist and
                            restrains the development of our exports. Though our agricultural
                            exports to the enlarged <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> were at an
                            all-time high totalling $2.4 billion in 1971, it has been estimated that
                            these exports could amount to $5-7 billion in 1980 if the major
                            agricultural producers and importers including Western Europe and Japan
                            were to follow more liberal policies. This of course means that the
                            Community would have to find a way to meet the political interests of
                            their inefficient grain producers in Germany and we would have to
                            override the interests of our dairy lobby.</p>
                        <p>However, the whole open trading system is jeopardized by the accumulation
                            of tensions over developments, policies and practices. These tensions
                            generate much heat and feed protectionist forces which seek to pressure
                            governments to take restrictive actions. There is an important danger of
                            an escalation of restrictive measures and counter-measures which added
                            together would constitute a “trade war,” leading to a significant
                            erosion of the open, interdependent system and threatening economic
                            prosperity.</p>
                        <p>A priority task, therefore, is to move to control these pressures by
                            solving some of the troublesome short-term issues, but more importantly
                            to move into a major new round of trade negotiations which will subsume
                            many of the problems and provide an effective counter-thrust to
                            protectionist pressures. In doing so, it must be borne in mind that the
                            trade problems are disparate. Some have more economic impact than
                            others, while some generate more political heat than others. This argues
                            for a sound appraisal of our priorities in the trade field.</p>

                        <p>Obtaining a long-term liberalization of agriculture is in our interest
                            both on economic grounds (a large balance of payments pay-off) as well
                            as in terms of political advantages (the farm bloc is important to
                            maintaining a liberal trade posture).</p>
                        <p>Lowering the common external tariff of the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss> in reciprocal trade negotiations is important on both
                            economic and political grounds. It would reduce the tariff
                            discrimination inherent in the enlarged Community, and its free trade
                            arrangements with <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> and preferential
                            arrangements with others. It would heighten the real and perceived
                            interdependence of the two areas and would confirm that the two
                            continents are being tied closer together rather than drifting
                            apart.</p>
                        <p>The US and other countries not members of the enlarged <gloss
                                target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> will be engaged in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> in renegotiating with the enlarged
                                <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> the trade concessions accorded
                            them in the past 25 years by the UK, Denmark and Ireland. The
                            dissolution of the British Commonwealth trading system and the lowering
                            of the UK tariff to the level of the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>’s
                            common external tariff will provide us benefits. However, accession of
                            the UK to the Common Market will have some important unfavorable
                            consequences, particularly for exporters of agricultural commodities. It
                            will be a delicate matter to obtain enough for US agriculture in these
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> renegotiations to maintain US
                            agriculture’s support for further trade liberalization without
                            jeopardizing Western European willingness and ability to include
                            agriculture in the multilateral trade negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Eliminating the reverse preferences of the Community in non-European
                            areas is more important politically than economically. While the trade
                            impact may be small, the reverse preferences create the impression in
                            this country that the Community is carving out a vast discriminatory
                            trading bloc, and therefore undermine public and Congressional support
                            both for our European political and security objectives and liberal
                            trading policies. We have had some success in counteracting the spread
                            of reverse preferences in the Mediterranean, and we must keep up the
                            pressure.</p>
                        <p>There are many other issues in the trade field that require management
                            both in the short run and during the negotiations, but the above are the
                            immediate priorities.</p>
                        <p>One may wish to build up pressure through some of the short run issues,
                            e.g. by taking <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> action on the

                            but we must keep the priorities in mind and not permit the pressure on
                            short-run issues to get out of hand and interfere with these priority
                            objectives.</p>

                            is a sensitive issue and looms large in key sectors like computers and
                            aircraft. The Western Europeans want to encourage the development of
                            European firms which can match the efficiency and financial <pb n="289"

                            scale in Western Europe and adopt “Buy European” policies which might

                            resentment over the large American investment. We have begun an exercise
                            in the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> to examine this whole area

                        <p>Important to dealing with these problems should be the realization that

                            a crucial element of their economic strategy. This clearly affects their
                            policy toward trade and investment.</p>
                        <p>Energy policy, too, is a potentially divisive issue between the US and
                            the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>. The Western Europeans are
                            concerned about security of supply and the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss> is developing a common energy policy. Given the large US
                            stake in the European energy market in both trade and investment terms,
                            it is in our interest to avoid a competitive scramble for limited oil
                            resources and to reach a broad understanding with the Western Europeans
                            on a cooperative approach to the long-term energy problem and on
                            arrangements to share supplies in the event of an emergency.</p>
                        <p>A coordinated policy should include not only agreement on supply policies
                            but also an agreed approach to technical solutions to the energy
                            question, i.e., the development of alternate energy sources, the
                            improvement of environmental control, the increased efficiency of power
                            production and utilization and the institution of methods to conserve
                            energy. The United States is negotiating an agreement with the USSR for
                            cooperation in some of these energy technologies. Western European
                            nations will undoubtedly demand at least equal treatment, and we might
                            wish to consider this in the context of energy programs being developed
                            in the European Community and <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In the environmental sphere, the US should continue the cooperation on
                            environment already begun in the NATO Committee on the Challenges of
                            Modern Society (CCMS), the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> and
                            bilaterally with individual states and the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss>. By developing similar environmental standards, similar
                            methods of environmental control, and common rules of the game on
                            handling the costs of environmental control (the “polluter pays”
                            principle), we may prevent either side from interpreting the
                            environmental protective actions of the other as disguised trade
                            barriers.</p>
                        <p>The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendment of 1972 requires that
                            the President undertake to enter into international agreements to apply
                            uniform standards of performance for the control of pollutants from new
                            sources, toxic pollutants, and discharge of pollutants into the oceans.
                            One of the principal objectives of this provision is to avoid
                            handicapping US industry, to which stricter and more costly
                            environmental control requirements might be applied. Problems may arise
                            where European priorities and interests differ from ours.</p>

                        <p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, U.S. policymakers gave advanced
                            thought to the nature of the U.S. response to international monetary
                            crises and the need to restructure the international monetary system.
                            Papers on these matters looked at such issues as currency devaluations
                            and appreciations, suspending the dollar’s convertibility to gold, and
                            changing the official price of gold, all policy issues that, if their
                            consideration became public knowledge, could lead to intense,
                            destabilizing speculation in foreign exchange and commodity markets.
                            Papers on such issues, therefore, were usually classified and received
                            very limited distribution.</p>

                            the French franc. In 1972 concern centered on a possible breakdown in
                            1973 of the December 1971 Smithsonian Agreement on exchange rate
                            realignment. The sole contingency planning paper regarding the U.S.

                            looks forward to an early activation of the Special Drawing Rights Plan.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPP2">Schweitzer</persName> has indicated that
                            it might even be possible to consider activation at the September Annual
                            Meeting of the Bank and Fund. He believes, however, that a Ministerial
                            Meeting of the Group of Ten would probably have to take place, possibly
                            at the Annual Meeting itself. Presumably such a Ministerial Meeting
                            would include the French, even though they might not be participants in
                            the <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> scheme.</p>
                        <p>Any such timetable would probably mean that the Deputies of the Group of
                            Ten would need to begin work on the problem of activation fairly soon in
                            order to recommend a course of action to the Ministers. We might make a
                            tentative suggestion to Mr. <persName>Ossola</persName> that he convene
                            the Deputies to begin this work either at the February session of the
                                <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> or on the occasion of the next
                            meetings in Europe in the spring.</p>
                        <p>The following points are suggested for further exploration in the
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> Group as to the U.S.
                            position and posture on this problem.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Amount of Reserve Creation.—</hi>It has been suggested
                            that the United States would like to see reserves created in the amount
                            of $3 to $4 billion a year, amounting to a 4 or 5 percent annual
                            increase in global reserves. It is not clear whether this target would
                            be the initial asking price, for <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s
                            alone, or whether it would be adjusted downward (or upward) in the event
                            of a continuing addition to (or subtraction from) world reserves through
                            deficits (or surpluses) of the reserve centers. One question to be
                            examined is whether we should continue to envisage a constant annual
                            amount of reserve creation during the five-year period, or a larger
                            figure in the early years, followed by smaller figures in the later
                            years of the initial five-year period.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">U.S. Balance of Payments and European
                            Attitudes.—</hi>The question arises as to whether the Europeans will be
                            prepared to move to an early activation if the U.S. resumes a
                            substantial deficit on official settlements account in 1969 and in
                            ensuing years. The sources of reserve creation can become complex, and
                            more than $2 billion was apparently added to world reserves outside the
                            United States in 1968, despite an official settlements surplus of $1.6
                            billion in the U.S. In order to prepare our position on activation, it
                            will be necessary to make a projection of world reserve creation for
                            five years in the absence of any activation. This projection will depend
                            in part on a corresponding projection of the U.S. balance of payments
                            position during the period. Are we to assume no change in official
                            dollar holdings during the next five years, or an upward trend in these
                            holdings at a moderate figure?</p>

                        <p>2) <hi rend="italic">Gold Price Problems.—</hi>While an early activation
                            of the <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s would help to set at rest
                            speculation for an increase in the official price of gold, we cannot be
                            sure that an aggressive devaluation by the French would not bring this
                            problem to the center of the stage. Minister <persName corresp="#p_SK6"
                                >Schiller</persName>’s continued references to a “realignment of
                            currencies” might also envisage a change in the official monetary price
                            of gold, and hence references to it continue to keep up the hopes of
                            speculators.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> realignment problem
                            might become serious if the Germans and other Europeans were to delay
                            activation of the <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> and give the
                            French support for a rise in the official gold price. We hope that this
                            technique will not be adopted, and <persName corresp="#p_SK6"
                                >Schiller</persName> indicated last November that he was in favor of
                            activation of the Special Drawing Rights. But it seems possible that he
                            is seeking a general realignment of currencies to facilitate and cover a
                            Deutschemark revaluation, and it is reported that he has expressed the
                            view that the dollar is overvalued.</p>
                        <p>An aggressive French devaluation, which carried with it at least some
                            depreciation of the pound sterling and other European currencies, could
                            present a problem to the U.S. in choosing its future gold and exchange
                            policy. This would be especially true if Germany, Italy, and Japan, for
                            example, were to follow the French with some depreciation. Presumably
                            these strong currencies would move only if the French depreciated by
                            such a large percentage that they would be fearful of the impact on
                            their trade. However, if by any chance there were such a general
                            depreciation by the major countries, the United States would seem to
                            face a decision on these basic alternatives: <list>

                                Reserve Assets.—</hi>Assuming that the problem of the gold/dollar
                            relationship is not brought to a head by some monetary crisis, as
                            mentioned in the preceding section, there is a more fundamental question
                            of the long-term U.S. policy with respect to convertibility of dollars
                            into gold. Various approaches have been suggested which have the effect
                            of limiting the potential strain of convertibility. One of these is the
                            freezing in some way of foreign dollar balances. One is the reserve
                            settlements account of Mr. <persName>E.M. Bernstein</persName>, which is
                            an advanced method of eliminating convertibility <pb n="295"
                                xml:id="pg_295" facs="0323"/>that would present very difficult if
                            not impossible negotiating problems. The third is a continuation of the
                            rather informal way in which convertibility has been to some extent
                            limited through central bank cooperation, the re-channeling of reserves
                            into the international money market, through commercial banks, and other
                            ways of holding down the growth in official dollar reserves.</p>
                        <p>The fourth approach is the suggestion for a dollar bloc and a gold bloc,
                            with a flexible exchange link between the two.</p>
                        <p>These various proposals may be judged against the long history of
                            monetary evolution. The convertibility of money into a metallic asset
                            has been steadily restricted until it no longer exists domestically in
                            most advanced countries. For a number of years convertibility into gold
                            has been limited to international transactions. Last year, the two-tier
                            system took a further step, and eliminated the convertibility of dollars
                            into gold at a fixed price for foreign private holders of dollars.</p>
                        <p>What remains is the convertibility link for foreign monetary authorities.
                            It is this link, and the possible loss of gold associated with it, that
                            provides the major remaining impetus to international adjustment arising
                            out of the balance of payments. But this link also threatens the
                            stability of the monetary system, by permitting a run on the U.S. gold
                            reserve on the part of foreign central banks.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps one of the most important long-term problems facing the U.S. is
                            how to move out of this commitment in a graceful manner without causing
                            undue disturbance to the monetary system and with a fair measure of
                            international approbation, at some time in the future. It is not yet
                            clear whether this can be done, and a breaking of the link may have to
                            come in the context of some crisis and a threatened run on the
                            dollar.</p>
                        <p>One possibility, over time, is that the nations of the world come to
                            accept Special Drawing Rights in lieu of gold when they convert dollars
                            into other reserves. Such preference for <gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                                >SDR</gloss>s over gold may be a long time in coming. The preference
                            of many monetary authorities for gold would be to some extent weakened
                            if it became clear that the commodity gold price could dip below the
                            official price of $35 per ounce.</p>
                        <p>A partial approach to the problem of reducing our vulnerability to
                            convertibility would be the freezing of dollar balances in some form.
                            Most experts believe, however, that this would not be acceptable to
                            foreign countries without some kind of commitment to the effect that the
                            U.S. would no longer have the flexibility of settling its deficit
                            initially with dollar liabilities instead of reserve assets. There is a
                            feeling in many quarters that it would be dangerous for the U.S. to give
                            up the more favorable bargaining position which it now has, when it can
                            pay out dollars initially and then discuss with foreign monetary
                            authorities <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0324"/>the various
                            techniques for handling these dollars if the central bank does not want
                            to hold them in its reserves. The reason for this feeling is that, with
                            the U.S. unable to create new reserves in this form, the European
                            countries might use too harshly their veto over the creation of Special
                            Drawing Rights so that the growth in reserves that would be permitted
                            might fall heavily short of the amounts needed to prevent a steadily
                            tightening shortage of world reserves.</p>
                        <p>The same considerations apply to the Bernstein plan, which makes no
                            allowance for the role of the U.S. as a continuing reserve center with
                            the potential power to create additional reserves in the form of dollar
                            liabilities. Under that plan, there would be no increase in dollar
                            liabilities held as reserves.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. still has to develop a clear position as to its long-range
                            objective with respect to the maintenance of convertibility and the
                            interchangeability of dollars and gold.</p>
                        <p>4) <hi rend="italic">Exchange Rate Policies and Principle—Fixed Parity or
                                Limited Flexibility.—</hi>This subject has attracted especial
                            attention during the past year.</p>
                        <p>Particularly among academic economists, it has been argued that the
                            system of fixed exchange rates has come to place too much pressure on
                            deficit countries to conform to rates of growth and rates of costs and
                            price inflation in the rest of the world. It is argued that, because the
                            pressure to conform is markedly stronger in deficit than in surplus
                            countries, the latter have an exaggerated weight in determining the rate
                            of growth of aggregate demand in the world as a whole, and,
                            consequently, the rate of economic progress.</p>
                        <p>Against this, the practitioners of the fixed exchange rate system argue
                            the uncertainties for trade and investment under a system of limited
                            flexibility. However, perhaps more important is their fear that limited
                            exchange flexibility would reduce the resistance of governments to
                            inflationary pressure. Many central banks feel that the public and the
                            government can be to some extent aroused to the danger of inflation
                            through the necessity to protect reserves and maintain an established
                            exchange rate.</p>
                        <p>The November meeting of the Ministers of the Group of Ten in Germany
                            marked perhaps the first occasion on which the finger was clearly
                            pointed at a surplus country by Ministers of other major countries, with
                            a strong implication <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0325"/>that an
                            appreciation of the exchange rate was desirable on international
                            grounds. True, the Ministerial Meeting in a sense symbolized this
                            pressure, because the Germans acted in fact just before the Ministerial
                            Meeting. They found a substitute for exchange rate appreciation, as a
                            compromise measure within the German government. This was the border tax
                            adjustment. It is generally believed that an important reason for using
                            this technique instead of exchange rate appreciation was the common
                            agricultural policy in the Common Market, and the effect of a German
                            appreciation on the German budget in the form of additional subsidies to
                            German farmers. These problems were avoided by eliminating the affected
                            agricultural commodities from the proposed adjustment.</p>
                        <p>Some brief comments on the particular techniques of limited exchange
                            flexibility are included in Attachment A.<note n="2" xml:id="d111fn2"
                                >Not printed. The paper explored six options: 1) maintenance of the
                                present Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates, subject to
                                adjustment for fundamental disequilibrium; 2) use of border taxes to
                                facilitate adjustment in trade accounts, while maintaining fixed
                                exchange rates; 3) adoption of crawling pegs on a mandatory or
                                discretionary basis; 4) adoption of wider margins, 2 percent or less
                                to 5 percent or more; 5) combination of 3 and 4 above; and 6) a gold
                                bloc and a dollar bloc with a flexible exchange link.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Both the British devaluation of November 1967 and the more recent German
                            corrective border taxes have brought to the fore an additional
                            consideration. In both cases supplementary measures appeared to be
                            necessary affecting domestic demand in order to avoid quick dissipation
                            of the adjustment effects of the action taken.</p>
                        <p>This calls to mind that any form of international adjustment in the trade
                            and service accounts tends to cut down profit margins in surplus
                            countries and to reduce real income in deficit countries. Both can be
                            resisted by those affected. Also, deficit countries need to shift
                            resources from non-competitive to internationally competitive activity;
                            the reverse movement is needed in surplus countries. There may very well
                            be important differences among countries in the ease of shiftability of
                            their resources. (Compare the U.K. and Japan.) One possible hypothesis
                            is that shiftability is low where there is a) strong resistance to a
                            reduction in real income on the part of the working population, and b)
                            where a relatively small proportion of resources is engaged in
                            internationally competitive activities as against non-competitive
                            production for the internal market.</p>
                        <p>These two experiences do suggest that it may be easy to over-estimate the
                            effect of limited exchange flexibility in permitting countries to follow
                            more diverse policies with respect to rates of growth and rates of
                            inflation of costs and prices. The further unfolding of the German
                            experience under the border tax arrangements may be instructive in this
                            respect.</p>
                        <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0326"/>
                        <p>It has been suggested that limited exchange flexibility might not make a
                            very large contribution to changing the U.S. trade and current account
                            position. If this were to be the case, the principal effect might be to
                            ease somewhat the pressure on deficit countries abroad, which have
                            smaller economies with a larger segment of total production devoted to
                            foreign trade.</p>
                        <p>It has also been suggested that limited exchange rate flexibility might
                            have significance for the U.S. in other ways than through the effect on
                            our current account deficit. Conceivably, such flexibility might in fact
                            worsen our current account deficit if it resulted in a gradual
                            depreciation of other currencies as a whole against the dollar. One
                            suggestion is that the adoption of these limited flexibility techniques
                            might be useful because it might permit public attention to be focused
                            on the exchange rate rather than on balance of payments and reserve
                            figures, as at present.</p>

                            activation of <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> somewhere in the range
                            of $1 to $2 billion by sometime in the fourth quarter in 1969. I am left
                            somewhat uncertain as to what kind of performance on our balance of
                            payments figures would have to be shown to achieve this. On the whole I
                            don’t believe that the amount of activation will vary too much if we
                            show a better performance, but activation could be deferred if our
                            results are too bad.</p>
                        <p>The main result of <persName corresp="#p_VLE1">Van Lennep</persName>’s
                            effort to find a role for WP-3 in the activation process will probably
                            be that he himself will have to be consulted by <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPP2">Schweitzer</persName>, and will have a somewhat
                            stronger voice in determining <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0328"

                                >Schweitzer</persName>’s proposal. On the whole this influence will
                            probably be exerted to delay the activation somewhat and hold the amount
                            down to the range that <persName corresp="#p_VLE1">Van Lennep</persName>
                            considers desirable. On the other hand, his endorsement may be of some
                            value in influencing the Dutch position favorably and possibly that of
                            some other countries, although the latter should not be exaggerated. The
                            key factors remain the attitudes of <persName corresp="#p_SK6"

                        </p>
                        <p>We are working on a paper to build up the argumentation for a large
                            activation figure in 1969-70. I believe it is important to base our
                            argumentation on the two legs. The first is the fundamental
                            justification which has been built into the <gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                                >SDR</gloss> plan and is now accepted by most of the Europeans. This
                            is that <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> creation is required to meet
                            the secular need for growth in reserves. This should provide a basic
                            minimum figure every year of something like at least 3-4 percent of
                            reserves.</p>
                        <p>The second justification would be a temporary one, that of providing
                            reserves to cover the losses of reserves in recent years through gold
                            sales, and to replace reserves cancelled by repayment of short- and
                            medium-term credit. My worry is that <persName corresp="#p_VLE1">Van
                                Lennep</persName> will try to over-emphasize this second reason.
                            Throughout the negotiations, <persName corresp="#p_VLE1">Van
                                Lennep</persName> and McKay of the Netherlands Bank have had a
                            strong tendency to favor this second approach and to reject or play down
                            the first justification. I think this is dangerous for us, because it
                            leads to the conclusion that reserves are created only when there is
                            clearly evidence of serious disinflation in the world, as a kind of
                            cyclical interjection of purchasing power on a fine tuning basis in the
                            world’s economy. We struggled a long time to get away from this view and
                            to build up the need for a secular trend of growth in world
                            reserves.</p>
                        <p>I would strongly urge that we maintain the primary emphasis on the first
                            justification and not allow <persName corresp="#p_VLE1">Van
                                Lennep</persName> and his concern with the adjustment process to
                            push us too far into the second philosophy.</p>

                        <p rend="center">PRESIDENT NIXON’S TRIP TO EUROPE</p>
                        <p rend="center">February-March 1969</p>
                        <p rend="center">International Monetary System (for use in United Kingdom,
                            Germany, Belgium, Italy; see separate talking paper for France)</p>
                        <p>1. We are both interested in improving the international monetary
                            system.</p>
                        <p>2. In this context, it is essential to bring inflation under control in
                            the United States. This is a major goal of my Administration.</p>
                        <p>3. We have been looking in a preliminary way at a number of proposals to
                            see whether there are responsible improvements that can be made in the
                            system. On most of these we have no final view. I would be glad to hear
                            what is in your mind.</p>
                        <p>4. We have decided that an early and substantial activation of the
                            Special Drawing Rights would be extremely useful. This would be a
                            demonstration to the exchange and gold markets that we “mean business”,
                            as we say in the United States. A hesitant approach in timing or
                            magnitude would encourage those who profit from uncertainty. It would
                            leave individual monetary authorities under political pressure to build
                            up their gold reserves to an unnecessary and undesirable degree. I want
                            to make clear that we do not regard activation of Special Drawing Rights
                            as absolving us from the fiscal and monetary discipline needed to
                            improve our balance of payments position.</p>
                        <p>5. (If the discussion proceeds to more specific questions as to where and
                            how many Special Drawing Rights we would like to see created, the
                            following might be added.) I understand that during the negotiations,
                            illustrative figures were mentioned for activation at the rate of about
                            $1.5-$2 billion a year for the initial period of five years. My advisers
                            say it would be the part of wisdom to begin with a substantially <pb
                                n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0332"/>higher figure, particularly in
                            1969 and 1970. Ideally we would like to see activation before August, to
                            be announced at the end of September at the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> Annual Meeting.</p>
                        <p>6. There is a second problem that concerns us. The process of
                            international adjustment of balances of payments has become too
                            dependent upon selective controls and restraints. We would like to stop
                            the drift in this direction and search for other methods of reducing
                            excessive and persistent deficits and surpluses.</p>
                        <p>7. We owe it to ourselves to explore every possible new proposal for
                            improving the system, including those under discussion in academic
                            circles. We must be careful to do so without upsetting confidence.</p>
                        <p>8. Whatever changes we might encourage in the monetary system, none will
                            avoid periodic crises affecting individual currencies. As a result, we
                            will continue to need intensive financial cooperation.</p>
                        <p>8a. (<hi rend="italic">Only for Germany and Italy</hi>) We appreciate the
                            efforts made by your country to channel excessive inflows of capital out
                            of reserves and into international monetary and capital markets, as well
                            as your participation in financial assistance for countries facing
                            exchange difficulties.</p>
                        <p>9. I share the view that, unless we have reached a closer meeting of
                            minds, it would be dangerous to undertake a formal international
                            monetary conference.</p>
                        <p>10. Finally, you should know that I am not going to seek an answer to
                            these problems through a change in the monetary price of gold.<note

                                “our interest in a better monetary system, and our concern about

                                flexibility on gold except in the context of our general position.
                                If we are to be cooperative on gold, there must be a total package
                                that makes it worth our while.” (National Archives, <persName

                                ideas about a fluctuating exchange rate: there is too much history
                                that tells us that a fluctuating exchange rate, besides causing a

                                <item>The basic French attitude towards the international monetary
                                    system is fundamentally different from ours. Their persistent
                                    underlying objective has been (a) a substantial increase in the
                                    price of gold, large amounts of which are in French hoards, and
                                    (b) the imposition of very stern discipline on the U.S. through
                                    severe limitations on the future of the dollar as a reserve
                                    currency. Recent hints to U.S. officials of French views on
                                    reform maintain these two elements.</item>

                                <item>Certain elements in the French regime especially eager to see
                                    a rise in the official price of gold will deliberately stir
                                    speculation to their advantage. Great care must be taken in any
                                    allusions to monetary “reform”, as the French will tend to
                                    associate “reform” with an increase in the official gold price.

                                    States to avoid such disruptive action on their part. Any such
                                    proposal should be approached very cautiously, even though some

                        <p>1. We are both interested in improving the international monetary

                        <p>2. In this context, it is essential to bring inflation under control in
                            the United States. This is a major goal of my Administration.</p>
                        <p>3. We have been looking in a preliminary way at a number of proposals to
                            see whether there are responsible improvements that can be made in the
                            system. On most of these we have no final view. I would be glad to hear
                            what is in your mind.</p>
                        <p>4. We have decided that an early and substantial activation of the
                            Special Drawing Rights would be extremely useful. We hope that France
                            will look again at this instrument, and become a participant.<note n="2"

                            international adjustment of balances of payments has become too
                            dependent upon selective controls and restraints. We would like to stop
                            the drift in this direction and search for other methods of reducing
                            excessive and persistent deficits and surpluses.</p>

                            improving the system, including those under discussion in academic

                            avoid periodic crises affecting individual currencies. As a result, we
                            will continue to need intensive financial cooperation. Drastic
                            unilateral action by any country with major financial responsibilities
                            poses grave dangers for all.</p>
                        <p>8. I share the view that, unless we have reached a closer meeting of
                            minds, it would be dangerous to undertake a formal international
                            monetary conference.</p>
                        <p>9. Finally, you should know that I am not going to seek an answer to
                            these problems through a change in the monetary price of gold. I do not
                            see the need or reason for such action. I am well aware that this has
                            been a difference of view between our two countries. But I am convinced
                            that this would be disruptive and wrong.</p>

                                According to that text, early in his remarks the President said: “I
                                am going to speak very carefully now, because I realize that when a
                                Secretary of the Treasury, let alone a President of the United
                                States, says something about tax programs or international monetary
                                matters that it can have the effect of changing the price of gold
                                or, for that matter, changing the price of stocks and so forth and
                                so on.” (Washington National Records Center, Department of the

                        <p>2. Following are President’s remarks on international monetary affairs:
                            “There are indications that the problems affecting the international
                            monetary system are very possibly going to be a subject of not only
                            major discussion on the immediate trip but also they are going to be a
                            subject of major concern in this next year and perhaps within the next
                            two years.</p>
                        <p>Now is the time to examine our international monetary system to see where
                            its strengths are, where its weaknesses are and then to provide the
                            leadership, leadership which is responsible, not dictatorial, leadership
                            which looks to the good judgment and the good advice that we can get
                            from our friends abroad who will have a similar view about the necessity
                            for a sound international monetary system…. Here in this department, I
                            see you here at a time that is very exciting, very exciting because
                            whether it is in the field of tax reform, whether it is in the field of
                            international monetary policies, there is a need for new
                            approaches.”</p>

                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> Group met on March 11,
                            1969, to discuss international monetary issues and international
                            monetary reform. Three papers had been distributed by <persName
                                corresp="#p_WGH1">Willis</persName> to members of the Group on March
                            10 and 11 as a basis for discussion at the meeting.</p>
                        <p>The first paper was entitled “Strategy for Improving International
                            Monetary Arrangements” (VG/LIM/60-37, dated March 10). An earlier draft,
                            dated March 6, indicates it was drafted by Willis. The transmittal
                            memorandum on the March 10 paper notes that it was Part I of a Strategy
                            paper and had been revised based on suggestions made during a <persName

                        <p>The second paper was Part II, the unilateral approach of the “Strategy

                            improving international monetary arrangements to two: A. move in the

                            approach of a dollar, and possibly other currency, blocs; and B. the
                            Bernstein approach that would put the dollar on the same footing as
                            other currencies. (Washington National Records Center, Department of the

                            <item>Unless there are some changes in the international monetary and
                                payments system, cumulative strains could develop over the next few
                                years that could result in increasingly serious disturbances in the
                                framework of international monetary relationships. One aspect of
                                this strain on the monetary system could be heavy reserve losses for
                                the United States, through the conversion of dollars into gold by
                                foreign monetary authorities. The balance of payments on the
                                liquidity basis may well continue at $2-3 billion a year. A strong
                                anti-inflation program, though absolutely necessary, may not be
                                sufficient to shrink our liquidity deficit in a highly competitive
                                world. This prospect would be underlined by a vigorous program of
                                relaxing restraints on capital outflow, in a future situation of
                                relative monetary ease. The present official settlements surplus
                                results from heavy short-term borrowing by United States banks,
                                which pulls money out of foreign official reserves. This is a factor
                                related to credit stringency here, and may prove to be temporary. We
                                may face attrition of our reserves, and periodic currency crises can
                                add to our gold losses.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Our strategy therefore calls for either (a) negotiating
                                substantial but evolutionary changes in present monetary
                                arrangements, or (b) suspending the present type of gold
                                convertibility and following this with an attempt to negotiate a new
                                system, in which the United States would undertake a more limited
                                and less exposed form of convertibility of the dollar. The second
                                course, which would necessarily imply unilateral action by the
                                United States, would involve an initial shock to other countries.
                                The extent of the shock would vary with the circumstances preceding
                                such a decision. The reaction abroad might be less nervous if the
                                decision were made at the time of an exchange crisis and after large
                                U.S. gold losses.</item>

                            <item>In our judgment, substantially more needs to be done in 1969 and
                                1970 to improve the monetary system than the European monetary <pb

                                present horizon is limited to a cautious activation of Special
                                Drawing Rights in an amount of no more than $2 billion a year for
                                five years. While we cannot of course expect negotiations on a more
                                far-reaching package of improvements to be completed within a few
                                months, we do believe that the United States needs to reach its own
                                judgment before June 1969 as to whether there is a reasonable
                                prospect of carrying on with our present responsibilities in an
                                improved system.<note n="2" xml:id="d119fn2">The President met with

                                high level support, would be essential to push such a campaign

                                action to remove the privilege of gold convertibility at the
                                initiative of foreign monetary authorities. We could then allow some
                                time to elapse to see how foreign countries reacted. Presumably many
                                countries would continue to peg to the dollar and no basic change
                                would take place. With others, reluctance to hold dollars might lead
                                to appreciation of exchange rates, to floating rates for capital
                                transactions, to direct measures cutting down the inflow of dollars
                                or to the use of central banking techniques for rechanneling dollars
                                into international money markets. In the political sense, the world
                                might tend to split into a dollar area, comprising (a) those
                                countries that were quite willing to accumulate dollars, and (b)
                                countries, principally in Europe, that would prefer to hold down
                                their dollar accumulations. In the light of developments, we would
                                proceed with calm and unhurried negotiations looking toward all of
                                the elements of paragraph 4 above, but with generally less emphasis
                                on the speed of decisions. However, it would still be desirable to

                            <item>In the transitional phase, following the suspension of
                                convertibility at foreign initiative, there could be some initial
                                confusion in the exchange markets, until the policies of the major
                                countries had been clarified. It has been suggested that some
                                private and official holders of dollars might move into Swiss

                                transition period the United States might not wish to relax
                                restraints on capital outflow or ease monetary policy, to avoid
                                adding to the flow of dollars with which the stronger currency areas
                                were coping.</item>

                            <item>The most difficult question under this second approach is whether
                                the United States would go back to convertibility, and, if so, what
                                type of convertibility the United States would be willing to resume.
                                Presumably this would mean that the United States would pay out gold
                                and/or Special Drawing Rights for dollars under some new
                                convertibility principles. Presumably most of the present official
                                dollar holdings would be exchanged for Special Drawing Rights or
                                some special type of reserve asset, so that the United States would
                                not be exposed to the risk of large-scale conversions. Establishing
                                the new principles might require intensive monetary negotiations,
                                which might take months or years. A specific United States position
                                on the new type of convertibility has still to be formulated.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> explained US thinking
                                on <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> activation, stressing that
                                while <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s could not be looked upon
                                as answer to all problems besetting monetary system, would be
                                important contribution to stability if activation decision would be
                                taken at September meeting <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. If
                                this to be achieved would be useful for leading countries to begin
                                to discuss matter so as to reach consensus among themselves by say
                                June, or at least before vacation period begins. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> also emphasized that while
                                US by no means feels <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s are method
                                of solving US balance of payments problems, US does have need, over
                                time, to increase its own reserves and <gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                                    >SDR</gloss> creation would help achieve this. In terms amount

                                average annual amount to be created should be significantly larger
                                than two billion dollar figure that has been mentioned widely. This
                                would show governments are willing to act boldly to combat tensions
                                in monetary system and would provide needed liquidity to compensate
                                for fact gold had not recently been flowing into monetary reserves
                                and that much of recent liquidity creation has been crisis borne,

                            <item>Colombo replied he shared belief that <gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                                    >SDR</gloss> creation, while not panacea, would have both
                                psychological value in alleviating speculation and other strains and
                                constituted innovation which gradually can bring about change in
                                monetary system. In beginning Italy had shared view that achievement
                                US balance of payments equilibrium should be precondition to
                                activation, but at last year’s <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                                meeting Italy stated that <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>
                                creation and re-establishment US B/P equilibrium should take place
                                simultaneously. If US and other deficit countries were to achieve
                                B/P equilibrium, without <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>
                                creation, repercussions on world liquidity would be too drastic.
                                Italy ready to begin talks among <gloss target="#t_G101"
                                    >G-10</gloss> countries on activation, even in advance of
                                completion of requisite number of ratifications, but question of
                                amount, of whether creation should be on one-year or on multi-year
                                basis and of how creation should be distributed over years must be
                                carefully considered. There is a range of divergent views in Europe.
                                Kind of magnitudes <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>

                                By way of “friendly advice” <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                    >Colombo</persName> urged that question of activation should not
                                be pushed so hard and fast within <gloss target="#t_G101"
                                    >G-10</gloss> as to create new obstacles to idea of activation,
                                since there were countries in Europe that did not look at this
                                question “with same objectivity as Italy.”</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> emphasized that major
                                problem in US was getting control of inflation and thereby placing
                                US balance of payments on a healthy, long-term basis. This is
                                intention of administration. <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                    >Colombo</persName> said he shared this view, and did not wish
                                to suggest US had any other alternative. He did want US to know that
                                Italy is somewhat concerned about difficulties for its own B/P
                                caused by lop-sided structure US payments. High world interest rates
                                caused by tight money in US are attracting capital from Italy. On
                                other hand, if US should re-establish B/P equilibrium too abruptly,
                                this would have adverse effects on Italy’s exports and trade
                                position. These double dangers argued for gradualism in US action to
                                achieve better balance.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> described US thinking
                                on proceeding soon to a limited relaxation of controls on capital
                                exports, mentioning that liberalizing move in this direction would
                                also help in stemming pressures for trade protectionism in US, which
                                new administration determined to combat. <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                    >Colombo</persName> replied that if such measures could be taken

                                allocations or mixture of proportion allocations combined with

                                to examine it and look at as sympathetically as possible. Again,

                                The talks would take place on the fringes of an April 24-25 meeting
                                of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>’s WP-3 that would
                                provide cover for U.S. officials’ travel to Paris, minimizing the
                                possibility of press leaks. (Telegram 58690 to Paris, April 16;

                                <item>It is to be understood that U.S. Government has not as yet
                                    developed an official view on any of these suggestions, or on
                                    general question whether any formal or informal change is
                                    required in present exchange rate regime. At same time, interest
                                    in these ideas is sufficiently widespread so that we believe
                                    careful exploration of some of issues involved is desirable. Our
                                    interest at this stage is in elucidation, at technical staff
                                    level, of technical and policy issues that would be posed if any
                                    such changes were to be decided upon. Object would be to
                                    increase our understanding of issues involved, and to obtain
                                    some indication of tentative views of authorities of important
                                    countries, as input to reaching official U.S. views of these
                                    ideas.</item>

                                <item>We would be glad to engage in series bilateral technical talks
                                    on these questions, in great secrecy, if authorities these
                                    governments would find it useful. Have no wish to press if
                                    authorities are not interested. Same offer being made to all

                                >G-10</gloss> countries will wish to accept offer if they are
                            satisfied talks will be adequately protected against leaks.
                            Extraordinary care should be taken to limit knowledge of this offer to
                            those with absolute need to know.</p>
                        <p>3. As means of implementing our proposal request addressee posts review

                            />advisable) and indicate that if government wished pursue such studies,
                            our feeling is useful way to conduct talks would be for one or two teams
                            of U.S. Treasury and Fed technical personnel (one each) to visit host
                            authorities in near future. We envisage discussions as being distinctly
                            below level of Deputies or Alternate Deputies. U.S. technical people
                            will be prepared for visit as early as week of April 21. We envisage
                            talks would require about one full working day per country, though
                            perhaps some leeway might be left for a little more. If at conclusion of
                            this discussion discussants feel a second round would be useful,
                            arrangements could be made for foreign discussants to visit Washington
                            for this purpose at some time during May. We hope to finish any such
                            bilateral technical talks before end of May.</p>

                            freewheeling and was largely a get-acquainted session between the

                            developments in Europe made even more imperative the maintenance of a
                            common ground between the U.S. and the UK. Our two countries will not
                            always agree on specific issues but will generally fully understand each
                            other’s views. The President expressed the hope that the Chancellor and

                                German Cabinet had decided not to revalue the Mark; see <ref
                                    target="#d126">Document 126</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary reported that he and the Chancellor had discussed the
                            prospects for German revaluation and the French currency problem. The
                            Germans wanted company for their upward move but had not yet received
                            any. The President asked whether the Italians were not strong enough to
                            move, though he recognized their political problems. The Chancellor
                            noted that Italy has a strong current account position, which would get
                            even stronger if Germany revalued, but they face recurring capital
                            flight which reflects their political uncertainties.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor expressed the view that German revaluation was inevitable
                            and, in that case, should be done sooner rather than later. The current
                            problem is that the Germans are talking about it but taking no action.
                            The President asked why <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>
                            is doing so much talking, to which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> guessed that <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1"
                                >Strauss</persName> wants to delay the revaluation as long as
                            possible and accomplish it at his own initiative.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor noted that the Germans can talk without hurting themselves
                            but that the talking hurts others, especially the French and the UK. He
                            expressed the hope that <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName>
                            would not say much publicly unless he was ready to do something. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> was not very strong.
                            The Chancellor thought he was a clever man and in many ways not bad, but
                            that he was the worst chairman he had ever seen.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked the Chancellor for his views on the French
                            situation. Did the Chancellor think that it would change much
                                post-<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> or would the
                            governing establishment simply carry on?</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor responded that the French bureaucracy was very strong and
                            capable. It had held up the Fourth Republic and would continue to be
                            effective. He was uncertain, however, of Couve’s ability to make
                            decisions during the interim period.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that one of our academic experts foresaw little
                            change. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed that
                            there would be little change if <persName corresp="#p_PG5"
                                >Pompidou</persName> was elected, but he was not sure of this
                            outcome. If the Left decides to back the Center, the candidate of the
                            Center (presumably Poher) could win. This could occur even if the
                            Leftist ran second on the first ballot, with Poher running third. The
                            Center would not be able to <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0349"
                            />deliver its votes to the Left, but the reverse could occur. The Left
                            might wish to support Poher in order to dilute the power of the
                            Presidency and shift power back toward the Assembly.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor thought this would represent a return to the Fourth
                            Republic and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> fully
                            agreed. The Chancellor was not sure that the Left would support the
                            Center, but Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            responded that the interest of the Left was to destroy a strong
                            presidency in order to produce a fairly weak government. The Chancellor
                            did not think the Communists would clearly opt for a centrist over
                            Pompidou, but he admitted that they would like to see a weak government
                            emerge. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed and
                            thought this argued for the thesis he had just outlined. The Gaullists
                            would not hold together without <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>, but if <persName corresp="#p_PG5"
                                >Pompidou</persName> wins there will be little change in the short
                            run.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked about French economic policy. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> thought that it would
                            improve because General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>’s interference had been a major problem. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCF1">Bergsten</persName> noted that the outcome of the
                            wage negotiations was one key element in the situation and a key
                            question was whether the new government could hold them down. The
                            Chancellor and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName>
                            agreed that these were key questions for the longer term but thought
                            they were not decisive for the short run viability of the franc.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> whether he assumed there would be no French
                            devaluation until their elections. The Secretary replied that the timing
                            was very tight. Germany must move soon in view of their election and
                            perhaps that is why <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> wants
                            to come earlier than originally planned.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor noted that <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>
                            would be visiting him at the same time and that the U.S. and UK should
                            therefore keep in close touch. If <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1"
                                >Strauss</persName> says the Germans will move but not until the
                            French election, there will be massive speculation between mid-May and
                            mid-June. The Chancellor thought it would be hard for Germany to revalue
                            sufficiently and there was no real pressure on them since they were
                            taking in money. The Secretary noted that such a scenario would bring
                            sterling under pressure, given the British reserve position. The
                            Chancellor noted that sterling had done all right today (May 1) despite
                            flows into Germany, but he reiterated his concern about the Germans’
                            talking and not acting.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that this could be an explosive year in Europe
                            politically. We do not know who the players will be by the end of the
                            year. We must all therefore remain flexible in our policies while at the
                            same time retaining a force for stability. The Chancellor affirmed that
                            there was now a new political situation in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The President remarked that it was his understanding that Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> now wishes to delay
                            his visit to Washington. The Chancellor <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322"
                                facs="0350"/>made it clear that the Prime Minister wishes to come
                            when he can, and the President added that it might be better for the
                            visit to follow the French election. The Chancellor agreed.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether the Prime Minister would be able to keep the
                            unions in check with his proposed new legislation. The Chancellor
                            replied that the legislation was the right thing to do and was
                            necessary. He thought they could get it through by the end of July
                            although it will be a battle. (The President commented that such a
                            proposal was “gutsy.”)</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FJ1">Freeman</persName> commented that
                            public opinion including labor was with the government on this issue. He
                            cited a recent poll showing 60 percent support for the government’s
                            proposal. In reply to the President’s question of why there was support,
                            the Ambassador commented that the rank and file union members were fed
                            up with their leadership, with the inconvenience of periodic work
                            stoppages, and that they were beginning to understand economic problems.
                            The Chancellor added that the great worry of union members was
                            unofficial strikes. The UK does not lose as many man-days of work per
                            year as does the U.S., but their strikes were less orderly. This
                            particularly incensed the wives of the union members. One advantage of
                            the British balance of payments problem is the development of widespread
                            appreciation of their economic difficulties; the monthly trade figures
                            are widely followed and the people are impatient for progress.
                            Nevertheless, there are significant problems within the union leadership
                            and the Parliamentary Labor Party, which includes 80 to 90 of their 330
                            MPs.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that these
                            back benchers would not vote against the government. The Chancellor said
                            that some would although they would hope others would keep them from
                            voting themselves out of power. The risk is that they would miscalculate
                            on the offsetting votes.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was interested in discussing the question because
                            popular attitudes reveal something about the character of a country. It
                            was encouraging to him that the British people were undaunted.
                            Governments could do things if their people were willing to take bitter
                            medicine. Many experts said that the UK was finished, but he had said on
                            his last telethon during the campaign that no one should under estimate
                            the resilience of Britain, which asserts itself at unexpected times.</p>
                        <p>The President then commented that we might be at a watershed in history.
                            With <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> gone we have a
                            great opportunity and need to develop new areas of strength. The
                            character of people, including the U.S. were critical in the making of
                            difficult decisions. Any one nation can affect others significantly by
                            standing up for what is right.</p>
                        <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0351"/>
                        <p>The Chancellor thought that Europe [Britain] might now achieve entry into
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, although it still might take a
                            year or so. Progress toward this goal would have a great impact on UK
                            morale. Morale was not low at the present time, however, despite the
                            balance of payments, because the economy was in good shape
                            otherwise.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that we should be thinking of new approaches on
                            several fronts when the situation is as fluid as this. He would take a
                            gingerly approach to improving the international monetary system since
                            we can’t talk too much without exacerbating our problems. He did hope,
                            however, that we could do some imaginative thinking in this period and
                            not just react to crises. We need to decide on what kind of Atlantic
                            Community we wish. It could not develop as originally conceived and the
                            passing of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would not
                            make it an easy task since there would still be Gaullists in all
                            countries. It was his hope, however, that we could make some attacks on
                            these problems. If not, more fragmentation would set in due to lack of
                            leadership and the world situation could become quite difficult. He
                            admitted that this discussion might sound esoteric, but he thought
                            strongly that we should not miss such an historical opportunity.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor agreed and noted that we must keep monetary questions in
                            their proper place, within the broad political framework. He said that
                            Britain would try to find its way through to its relationship with
                            Europe. The failure to do so to date had meant a total loss of momentum
                            for the European movement. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> noted that Poher would favor UK entry and that
                            even <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> was less hostile
                            than the General. He saw this as the major change likely in French
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>The President added that the real question is the Atlantic world that
                            would result. The Chancellor replied that the UK wants to enter Europe
                            to strengthen the Atlantic Community. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_FJ1">Freeman</persName> noted that this was precisely
                            the source of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>’s
                            opposition to UK entry, which must now be probed.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he had reminded the State Department of their
                            argument that our problems with Europe would disappear if <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> were gone, and had asked for
                            a paper on the subject. We needed to do some hard planning and thinking.
                            A real opportunity existed given a new French government, the German
                            election, and the Italian problem. We cannot seize the opportunity with
                            the old stereotyped approaches, however. A new breakthrough is required.
                            A key element is for us to remain flexible. The President expressed an
                            interest in any new approaches, which the UK might suggest, not just in
                            the financial field. If we develop no new approaches but just react to
                            developments, we might see Europe fragment—this tendency was the virus
                            of the day.</p>
                        <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0352"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> stated that he
                            hoped to explore quietly with French officials what the French could do
                            on the exchange rate before their election. He would avoid any intrusion
                            in the political scene. The President asked whether such an approach
                            could be private, and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> asked whether it would be conducted at the
                            expert level. The Chancellor thought an approach could be kept private.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> said he would
                            do it via Under Secretary Volcker. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> encouraged the British to make an effort to find
                            out as well, perhaps through Governor O’Brien, who is also close to the
                            French. A discussion ensued on how best to approach the French.</p>
                        <p>The President concluded with a reminder that we should not let the
                            movement of history pass us by while important situations change. The
                            Chancellor agreed and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> concluded that the situation had become
                            unfrozen.</p>

                        <p>Speculation on a revaluation of the German mark has increased
                            tremendously in the past two days, in response to statements by
                                <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> openly raising the
                            possibility of an early German move “in a period of calm, and in company
                            with other countries”.<note n="2" xml:id="d123fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>’ statements were not
                                further identified.</note> Renewed speculation on a French
                            devaluation has resulted from the exit of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> plus the expected DM revaluation. The main danger,
                            however, is that both events—which are probably inevitable—will not
                            occur soon enough to prevent a massive run on the British pound, which
                            could force the UK <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0353"/>to abandon
                            its fixed exchange rate, devalue by a sizable amount, and/or apply
                            import restrictions.</p>
                        <p>The direct economic effect on the US of any or all of these changes would
                            be small and certainly manageable. A major problem for us would arise
                            only if a forced British move disrupted confidence in the functioning of
                            the entire international monetary system, which could lead to efforts by
                            foreign monetary authorities to convert their dollar reserves into US
                            gold. A failure of the three main foreign governments to respond
                            responsively to the situation could, in the extreme, generate widespread
                            financial chaos with deleterious political and economic effects on the
                            US. (The economic effect would be much more serious in all other
                            countries than in the US. However, the plain fact is that only the US
                            will take responsibility for the functioning of the entire system.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> proposes that we
                            encourage the Germans and French to change their exchange rates as soon
                            as possible and by appropriate amounts. The amount cited in the Treasury
                            memorandum—a move of 10 percent by each—is about right. It would be
                            desirable for the Germans to revalue by a bit more, but it would be
                            undesirable for the French to devalue by very much more.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Kennedy’s memorandum recommends only that we try to energize
                            the French and Germans to reach bilateral agreement on the questions,
                            and asks for approval to indicate your support for the approach.</p>
                        <p>I will not dispute the economic analysis involved in making this
                            recommendation. The basic issue is how close Western Europe is to a
                            financial panic. But any move toward French devaluation and German
                            revaluation will be extremely difficult politically for both
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>In my judgment <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> would not
                            have publicly mentioned revaluation (<hi rend="italic">before</hi>
                            discussing it with the Chancellor) if he were willing to move quickly.
                            Furthermore, it is highly doubtful that France will devalue one or two
                            weeks after <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> unless
                            forced to do so by a financial panic. A basic question is who would make
                            the decision: Couve would not reverse his mentor and Poher’s position is
                            clearly not sufficiently strong. And neither Germany nor France will act
                            in order to save Britain. The threat to Britain and ultimately the U. S.
                            could thus develop as outlined above. (I have checked my political
                            judgments with the State Department, which agrees.)</p>
                        <p>If massive speculation becomes a virtual certainty, it may become
                            necessary for us to weigh in with an effort to convince the Germans
                            and/or French to move in order to avoid the major risk already cited,
                            despite the political risks of so doing. Such an effort might require
                            your personal involvement. Our main pressure would probably have to be
                            applied to Germany, and the offset negotiations which began yesterday
                                <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0354"/>would provide an
                            opportunity to give them something in return.<note n="3"

                            we indicate to Germany our willingness to broaden our offset
                            negotiations in future years to include overall monetary cooperation,
                            and you asked to review this year’s negotiations for the possibility of
                            doing so sooner. The timing may prove to be extremely fortuitous.)</p>
                        <p>But such a U.S. effort would have highly sensitive foreign policy
                            implications—since we would in essence be trying to get other countries
                            to change their exchange rates—and the politics of any move to do so
                            should be considered extremely carefully before you decide to pursue it.
                            Until it is clear that we face a major crisis, we should keep our
                            profile as low as possible, since any major U.S. involvement—no matter
                            what its purpose—would almost inevitably be used by the French left as

                            <p>The unsettling effects of the French election on the exchange markets
                                were greatly aggravated yesterday by statements of German Finance
                                Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> openly
                                raising the possibility of an early German revaluation. While the
                                May Day holiday on the Continent is providing limited respite today,
                                it now seems likely that speculation will gather force until the
                                anticipated revaluation (and French devaluation) takes place. The
                                main danger is that, unless the impasse is broken shortly, there may
                                be a forced devaluation of the British pound, posing a clear risk of
                                a series of other devaluations at the expense of the dollar and
                                exchange stability generally.</p>
                            <p>This potential crisis comes at a time when intensive conversations
                                with the British and Germans give us a clear sense of their own
                                objectives and possible actions.<note n="6" xml:id="d123fn6">See

                                circumscribed by their transition and the difficulty of identifying
                                those currently most influential in this area.</p>
                            <p>We are initiating contacts with all the principal parties against the
                                background of the following objectives: <list>

                                    <item>The German mark should be revalued by 10 percent. The
                                        French franc should be devalued by 10 percent. The
                                        Netherlands guilder and Swiss franc should be revalued (by
                                        lesser amounts), if possible, recognizing this probably
                                        cannot be achieved before German action.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>The French-German action should take place as early as
                                        this weekend, or as soon as possible thereafter.</item>
                                    <label>3.</label>

                            </p>
                            <p>Our contacts would be directed at energizing the main parties at
                                interest—the French and Germans—to reach a bilateral accommodation
                                on these lines.</p>
                            <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0356"/>
                            <p>The main stumbling blocks are (1) German insistence heretofore that
                                their revaluation must not be in isolation, (2) French paralysis
                                during the transition, and (3) the unwillingness of the Dutch or
                                Swiss to “make company” for the Germans at this time. As part of our
                                effort to meet German resistance, we would indicate to them our
                                willingness to accept a relatively “soft” military offset, along the
                                lines of their present proposal. We have also initiated other
                                contacts with finance ministers and central banks. However, it would
                                be desirable if we could indicate your personal knowledge and
                                support of this approach. While we hope it will not be necessary, we
                                also hope we could count on your personal intervention, if required
                                at a critical point.</p>
                            <p>This approach has been discussed with and is supported by the State
                                Department, the Federal Reserve, and the Council of Economic

                        </p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MCPW1">McCracken</persName>’s memorandum is
                            contradictory on one of the crucial elements of the situation. It states
                            at one point that “there are no indications” that Germany will revalue
                            unilaterally, and at another that they “will probably change their view
                            if more money flows in”. I share the former judgment; the present
                            monetary system puts very little real pressure on surplus countries to
                            act short of intense political pressure from the rest of the world. In
                            the case of Germany, this means in practice that the US would have to
                            involve itself deeply—probably including your personal intervention—to
                            change their minds.</p>
                        <p>Second, the memorandum indicates only by omission that the US is well
                            shielded from any direct effects of the present European currency
                            problems. Our exceedingly tight monetary policy is keeping the dollar
                            extremely strong in the exchange markets. Thus our only purely national
                            worry is the possibility that a real financial panic will ensue and lead
                            foreign monetary authorities to lose their nerve and seek to convert
                            their dollars into US gold. We might then be forced to suspend the
                            convertibility of the dollar into gold, which would risk major foreign
                            policy problems as outlined in my memo last Friday.<note n="3"

                                <ref target="#d123">Document 123</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Third, I fully endorse Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MCPW1"
                                >McCracken</persName>’s conclusion that the UK is the major
                            potential crisis point in the system and therefore agree with his
                            recommendation that we express our hope that the UK will hold its
                            present exchange rate.</p>
                        <p>However, I do not agree with his recommendation that we tell the UK that
                            we would prefer a floating exchange rate for the pound to new import
                            restrictions, if they are forced to do something. Even on purely <pb
                                n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0358"/>economic grounds, it is not
                            clear that our balance of payments would be hurt more by restrictions
                            than by a change in the exchange rate of sterling. More important,
                            however, a UK decision to float would represent a major break with the
                            present monetary system and is much more likely than new restrictions to
                            induce other countries to follow. Thus, a decision to float is much more
                            likely to touch off a panic. It is true that import restrictions would
                            only buy time for the UK, but there is good economic reason to believe
                            that they are finally on the right track and that a bit more time will
                            permit them to hold their present exchange rate.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I agree that we need to move specifically toward reforming the
                            monetary system so that such crises will not recur continuously and that
                            the “crawling peg” is a desirable element in such reform. There are two
                            problems with his recommendation that we come out more openly for such
                            an approach, however.</p>
                        <p>One problem is that we should be very cautious about openly advocating
                            the “crawling peg” at the present time. Any US statement on exchange
                            rates would increase market nervousness and run counter to Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCPW1">McCracken</persName>’s other recommendation that
                            we avoid making any statements on the present situation. (We should,
                            however, be alert to opportunities afforded by the present situation to
                            increase support for our reform ideas.)</p>
                        <p>The other problem is that you have not yet received the options paper on
                            monetary issues which you asked the Treasury to provide a month ago. As
                            a result, you have not had an opportunity to consider the subject
                            systematically and we have no agreed policy. We need to move on this
                            quickly before a real crisis overtakes us.</p>

                        <p>As currency uncertainties emerged in early May 1969, due to the imminent
                            change in the French Government and renewed speculation that the German
                            Mark would be revalued and the British pound devalued or allowed to
                            float, policymakers began to consider options for actions by the U.S.
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>A May 7 paper entitled “Policy Considerations in Current Monetary
                            Situation” had a short-term focus related to the current crisis, while a
                            May 10 draft memorandum to the President on the Secretary of the
                            Treasury’s letterhead entitled “U.S. Policy Options With Respect to
                            International Monetary Evolution” looked to the longer term evolution
                            over the next decade. Both papers are in the Washington National Records

                            forward to the President, but many of the ideas in the memorandum are
                            included in the paper prepared for the meeting with the President on

                        <p>The decision of the German Cabinet not to revalue the mark will leave an
                            air of uncertainty over international financial developments for some
                            time. The immediate outlook for the exchange markets is highly
                            uncertain, and turns on the credibility of the German position. This
                            will depend, in large part, on what other tax and financial measures the
                            Germans are prepared to take. The Germans have been extremely vague on
                            this, and no decisions are expected until the middle of next week, at
                            the earliest.</p>
                        <p>While the German position on the mark parity is unsatisfactory, I see no
                            alternative but to accept it as an accomplished fact for the time being,
                            and to work as best we can within that framework in the days ahead.<note

                                meeting, as reported in some press stories, or that Ambassador
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PR8">Pauls</persName> failed to convey it
                                to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> promptly enough.
                                This report came from Bundesbank Director <persName corresp="#p_EO1"
                                    >Emminger</persName>, who with the rest of the Bundesbank firmly
                                supported <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName>’s effort to
                                get revaluation, to Federal Reserve Board Governor <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DJD2">Daane</persName> at the Sunday meeting of
                                central bankers in Basel.” (Ibid., Agency Files, Box 215, Council of
                                Economic Advisers)</note> Revaluation has become a straight party
                            issue, with <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> leading the
                            CDU opposition. While some reports indicate the Chancellor himself has
                            some sympathy for revaluation, in the last analysis there seems little
                            chance that he would reverse the decision, unless or until external
                            conditions and pressures change. In practice, this would require an even
                            more severe crisis in the exchange markets or changes in parity by other
                            countries so the Germans have “company.”</p>
                        <p>Our interest for the short run lies in (1) promoting a reversal of the
                            recent speculation into marks, and (2) building protection against the
                            possibility that new speculative pressures will converge on sterling. To
                            help achieve the former, in press statements and contacts we will cast
                            no doubt on the ability of the Germans to sustain their position, accept
                            it as a fact, and make plain the necessity for supporting measures to
                            repel speculation.</p>
                        <p>The second objective is supported by the agreement now reached under
                            pressure from events and the U.S., between the U.K. and the <pb n="333"

                            credit package. This will be leaked to the press in London in time for
                            the Monday papers.</p>
                        <p>The question of additional credit facilities for the British, by the U.S.
                            and other countries, will also arise, especially if speculative
                            pressures on sterling are not reversed. The Federal Reserve, in contacts
                            this weekend at the regular Basle meeting of central bankers, will test
                            sentiment on this difficult issue. With respect to “recycling” recent
                            German gains, the question of a German government guarantee may
                            arise.</p>
                        <p>If a calmer market atmosphere prevails in the days and weeks ahead, some
                            orderly realignment of exchange rate parities still may be possible this
                            summer. This would be a prelude to our efforts to achieve more
                            fundamental reforms. But it is clear we will continue to face formidable
                            uncertainties until the politically-charged impasse on exchange rates is
                            resolved.</p>

                        <p>The May 27 summary of these consultations included the following points:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Prevailing attitude toward greater exchange-rate flexibility:
                                    negative, especially if allowance is made for the veil of
                                    courtesy and friendliness which lead many to soften their
                                    criticisms and doubts; in the second round with the British they
                                    wanted to be sure the U.S. was not misled by their willingness
                                    to engage in constructive discussion and made clear their
                                    attitude was basically negative.</p>
                                <p>“Role of the dollar: other side invariably raised and we could
                                    see no practical alternative to continuation of the present
                                    system, i.e., the dollar pegged to gold at the $35 price, and
                                    other currencies ‘flexing’around the dollar.</p>
                                <p>“Discrete changes: no one disagreed and some insisted that large
                                    ‘one time’ parity changes could not be ruled out.</p>
                                <p>“Discipline: widespread concern that greater exchange-rate
                                    flexibility would weaken ‘disciplinary’ pressures on deficit
                                    countries.</p>
                                <p>“Wider margins: no strong support and considerable opposition,

                                    seemed unanimous in regarding wider margins as posing more of a

                        <p>Talks concentrated on improvement of international monetary system.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> would like to see
                            three major actions—(1) activation of <gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                                >SDR</gloss>, (2) general realignment of exchange rates, and (3)
                            increased rate flexibility. While his preference would be for
                            simultaneous action on these measures, he recognized this unrealistic.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Schoellhorn</persName> indicated belief
                            that activation could be made acceptable in Germany provided there was
                            public acknowledgement that other steps to strengthen monetary system
                            were contemplated. In drafting a brief communique, key point for
                                <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> was that
                            “establishment of the special drawing rights facility in the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> will be one important step in the
                            orderly evolution of that system.” Germans were particularly concerned
                            to get proper translation of word “one.” Word “establishment” is also
                            interpreted by <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> to include
                            both ratification and activation.</p>

                                    >footnote 2</ref> above), Schoellhorn found the higher estimates

                                <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> did not press case
                            for only small amount, or for delay, but neither did he respond

                            for extensive technical studies on flexibility proposals, and <persName

                            studies on flexibility should proceed though no technicians yet

                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> cautioned that
                            several countries were still very anxious that nothing be said publicly
                            about these studies or to indicate that serious consideration being
                            given to flexibility. Believe Germans are prepared proceed on this
                            basis. Significantly, <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName>
                            indicated that while his position with respect to three steps in reform
                            of monetary system shared by Bundesbank and academic institutes in
                            Germany, same elements in Cabinet and public, which strongly and
                            effectively opposed revaluation, oppose all proposals on flexibility.
                            Nevertheless, he saw merit in proceeding with studies and plans, which
                            he agreed to keep secret until after <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>

                                for the UK unless the German government guarantees the credit
                                against UK default. Coming against the total inflow of $5 billion
                                since the French referendum, the amount is thus grossly inadequate
                                and, unless Britain is better provided for, may not be adequately
                                distributed.</item>
                            <item>Second, as noted by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MCPW1"
                                    >McCracken</persName>, the market is clearly skeptical that
                                exchange rate changes will be avoided. Only about 25 percent of the
                                inflows have moved back out through the market. Most of the
                                speculative money, at least for the moment, is awaiting further
                                developments.</item>
                            <item>Third, there are additional uncertainties: <list>
                                    <item>—Dr. <persName corresp="#p_MCPW1">McCracken</persName>
                                        relayed the bad U.S. balance of payments figures.</item>
                                    <item>—The British trade figures are bad for the third month in
                                        a row and will heighten doubts that Britain has solved its
                                        balance-of-payments problem.</item>
                                    <item>—The French trade figures for April are also bad and have
                                        intensified the view that devaluation of the franc must
                                        occur fairly soon.</item>
                                    <item>—The additional German economic measures, adopted “in lieu
                                        of revaluation”, are aimed mainly at their domestic
                                        inflationary pressures and hence will further increase their
                                        external surplus; their measures to deal directly with the
                                        external position are puny.</item>
                                </list>
                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Outlook</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The one ray of hope is that Germany, despite its public avowals that its
                            decision not to revalue is “eternal”, has already indicated privately
                            that it will still consider revaluation if it can get company from other
                            countries. But no “company” seems interested and the Germans have also
                            indicated that “eternal” means “until after its election in <pb n="339"
                                xml:id="pg_339" facs="0367"/>September.” There is virtually
                            unanimous agreement that a DM revaluation is inevitable; hence a new
                            speculative crisis is certain to develop as the election approaches.</p>
                        <p>What France will do regarding devaluation, after the runoff election, is
                            unclear. Some experts think that <persName corresp="#p_PG5"
                                >Pompidou</persName> would devalue quickly and pin the blame on
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. And Poher has
                            begun to echo the <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> call
                            for a “multilateral realignment”.</p>
                        <p>Any new French government, however, would probably wish to deal with the
                            pending wage negotiations before devaluing and would also need time to
                            prepare a plan for supplementary domestic measures to make any
                            devaluation work. (Such a position is quite defensible.) By the time
                            these two problems are met, the Bonn elections may be close at hand and
                            Germany will probably not wish to move even in concert with others. In
                            short, there is no certainty that France will provide Germany with its
                            desired “company” very soon.</p>
                        <p>The UK will also remain on the margin, with liquid debts swamping its
                            meager reserves, especially if the <persName corresp="#p_WJH2"
                                >Wilson</persName> Government continues to face major political
                            problems. There is little chance of a discreet UK devaluation, however,
                            which would provide “company” for Germany. The British would be more
                            likely to impose additional import controls or let the pound float
                            freely. A French devaluation without a German revaluation could force
                            such action on the UK.</p>
                        <p>General uneasiness about exchange rates, especially if coupled with large
                            U.S. deficits, could also jeopardize European agreement to early and
                            sufficient activation of Special Drawing Rights and thereby exacerbate
                            the jitters surrounding the system.</p>
                        <p>The United States has two tactical options in the present situation: <list>

                                <item>We can attempt to apply pressure soon, during a period of
                                    relative calm, to try to pre-empt future crises. The pressure
                                    would be mainly on the Germans to revalue or take decisive
                                    alternative steps to reduce their payments surplus, but might
                                    have to extend to other countries to provide “company” for
                                    them.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>We can simply await the next crisis, which is virtually
                                    certain to occur by September and could come much earlier, and
                                    seek the desired changes then.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Experience shows that intervention in a period of relative calm—unless
                            handled extremely deftly and with extremely good luck—can create the
                            very crisis it seeks to pre-empt. Intervention during a crisis, however,
                            could plunge us even more deeply into the midst of a major domestic
                            political struggle in Germany.</p>
                        <p>Embassy Bonn has recommended against any U.S. intervention due to the
                            possibility of fanning “nationalistic sentiments” in Germany and
                            strengthening the right wing there. Our approach prior to the decision
                                <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0368"/>not to revalue was, of
                            course, unsuccessful. We are thus threatened with policy paralysis in
                            dealing with the immediate situation.</p>
                        <p>However, inaction carries serious risks. The certainty of renewed crises
                            and the nearness of the UK to bankruptcy means that the system could
                            suffer severe disruption. This could lead to renewed pressures on the
                            U.S. gold stock, especially if our balance of payments were to
                            deteriorate sharply, and force us to make some difficult decisions on
                            our own international monetary policy.</p>
                        <p>And even if the system does not face fundamental disruption, there is
                            likely to be a further escalation of restrictions on international trade
                            and payments by other countries unless the necessary exchange rate
                            realignment occurs and there is reform of the overall system.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Conclusion</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The short-term threat of renewed crises highlights the more fundamental
                            problems of the international monetary system. In fact, the short-term
                            problem of exchange rate realignment probably must be solved before we
                            can get the type of long-range reform favored by most of our
                            officials—greater flexibility of exchange rates—or even before this kind
                            of reform can be openly discussed internationally, because of the
                            probability of kindling speculation if rates are out of line when such
                            reform is discussed.</p>
                        <p>The time has thus come when the United States needs to define clearly its
                            strategy on both the short-term and longer-term aspects of the monetary
                            problem and pull the two together.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of important international monetary meetings in June.
                            In addition, Secretary Kennedy’s speech to the American Bankers
                            Association on June 20 provides an excellent opportunity for a major
                            statement of the Administration’s international monetary policy. If we
                            do not begin to move now, it will be difficult to do so before
                            September. At a minimum, we should be ready to take major initiatives in
                            the fall after the key European elections are over. We should thus try
                            to make our decisions fairly quickly.</p>

                        <p>These issues are discussed in paragraphs 51 to 65 of the attached

                            with quota increases, and “nibbling” gold sales to central banks could
                            possibly reduce our gold reserves as low as $8 billion. It is important
                            for negotiating purposes to know whether this prospect is

                        <p>The U.S. balance of payments is a problem because it can place
                            constraints on both our domestic economic policy and our foreign policy.
                            Our basic objective is to minimize those constraints. In addition, we
                            seek a smoothly functioning international monetary system because it
                            will promote world economic development and our basic foreign policy
                            objectives. We have four broad alternatives, which in practice can of
                            course be combined, for dealing with the problem: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>We can try to <hi rend="italic">finance our deficits</hi>.
                                    There are four ways to do so: <list>
                                        <label>(a)</label>
                                        <item>Borrow explicitly, from the International Monetary
                                            Fund or elsewhere. This would subject us to increasing
                                            foreign influence over our domestic economic policy and
                                            would only postpone the problem since all explicit loans
                                            of large magnitude would have relatively short
                                            maturities.</item>
                                        <label>(b)</label>
                                        <item>Borrow implicitly by inducing other countries to build
                                            their dollar holdings. At the extreme, this would mean
                                            getting (or forcing) the world to go onto a “dollar
                                            standard”. The probable magnitude is much greater here
                                            and would carry no fixed maturities. However, the
                                            outstanding dollar balances would always represent a
                                            threat to our reserves. They could also be a source of
                                            instability for the overall system unless the “dollar
                                            standard” were formalized, which could cause serious
                                            political problems.</item>

                                            deficits which may run to several billion

                                            a windfall reserve increase of $10 billion if the price
                                            were doubled. Some or most of it might, however, have to
                                            be used to convert outstanding dollar balances, which
                                            now exceed $15 billion in official hands and another $20
                                            billion in private foreign hands. Foreigners might be
                                            unwilling to add to their dollar holdings in the
                                            future—cutting off our main present avenue of financing.
                                            The net effects are thus not clear even in a financing
                                            sense. (I discuss this option in broader terms

                                    this conclusion and note also that a severe U.S. recession—which
                                    would probably be necessary—would be disastrous for foreign
                                    policy as well as domestic economic reasons since it would so
                                    drastically affect the living standards of so many other

                                    that we will probably have to maintain some controls whatever
                                    path we follow. I am not sure that this is right. I am sure that
                                    reliance on controls would require us to extend them well beyond
                                    where they are now—to cover all capital movements, Government
                                    transactions, and probably trade itself. Such reliance would
                                    increase greatly the pressures to bring back troops from Europe
                                    and cut aid. It would increasingly poison our international
                                    relations as well as be contrary to our basic economic
                                    philosophy.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>The negotiated multilateral option is most consistent with our overall
                            foreign policy. It would seek a solution through working together with
                            our allies, mainly those in continental Europe. Success in this effort
                            could mark a major milestone in building a truly cooperative Atlantic
                            Community and represent a major foreign policy achievement for this
                            Administration.</p>
                        <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0376"/>
                        <p>Either alternative approach would represent a unilateral move by the
                            United States which would antagonize a number of major countries. It
                            might thus be less costly, in political terms, to apply considerable
                            pressure on the Germans and others in an effort to carry off key parts
                            of the multilateral approach if by so doing we could avoid the need to
                            use one of the unilateral routes.</p>
                        <p>This sharp distinction becomes very much blurred in practice, however. It
                            will undoubtedly take a great deal of negotiated effort—including your
                            personal intervention—to achieve a satisfactory solution through
                            multilateral negotiation. This is because external constraints on the
                            U.S. can be reduced to a safe level only if we get much greater
                            allocation of <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s than most Europeans
                            want, much more realignment of exchange rates than most Europeans are
                            willing to do, and much faster movement toward greater flexibility of
                            exchange rates than most Europeans are even contemplating at the
                            moment.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, we have already moved a long way towards suspension of
                            the gold convertibility of the dollar. Germany has explicitly agreed not
                            to convert (under the implicit threat of troop withdrawals as part of an
                            earlier “offset” agreement). All other major countries are afraid to
                            queue up for gold for fear that we will close the window. We are thus
                            already achieving much of the gain from suspension—essentially through
                            accumulation of dollars by others—while minimizing the political costs
                            of blatantly unilateral U.S. action. We are compromising, however,
                            because we maintain controls, offset agreements, tied aid, etc. to try
                            to avoid a crunch by minimizing the amount of dollars that they will be
                            forced to accumulate.</p>
                        <p>In addition, formal suspension could have a desirable political effect.
                            It would force the Europeans to make the difficult choices which they
                            can avoid under the present system. It might thus provide a major
                            impetus toward closer European integration, much as our <persName
                                corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> Round initiative forced them to
                            make basic choices on their trade policy. And it might even help UK
                            entry since the continentals would feel forced to band together to
                            “counter a unilateral U.S. initiative” and could well decide that
                            maximum size was desirable in doing so. On the other hand, it must be
                            recognized that they might not be able to get together and the result
                            could be a further atrophy of the integration process with some of them
                            linking to the dollar and others going their own way.</p>
                        <p>The main political effect of either suspension or an increase in the gold
                            price is to break a U.S. commitment which dates to 1934. It is not clear
                            which would be worse from a foreign policy standpoint.</p>
                        <p>Suspension could cast doubt on the dollar value of countries’ gold
                            holdings but this is not very serious since the free market price of
                            gold <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0377"/>is above the official
                            price. The main effect would be on the major gold holders: the
                            continental Europeans, South Africa, and the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>An increase in the official gold price would break faith with all those
                            who have helped us for a decade by holding large amounts of dollars,
                            meaning most of the world outside continental Europe and even some of
                            the latter (e.g. Germany). It would raise domestic political problems in
                            many countries and the Japanese say that their government would fall if
                            we raised the gold price.</p>
                        <p>I would guess that the short-term political costs of suspension might be
                            greater, precisely because it would force the Europeans to make hard
                            choices. But because they would have to make these choices and get the
                            system reformed, suspension would probably lead to a better political
                            result over the longer term.</p>
                        <p>An increase in the gold price would effectively eliminate the impetus to
                            basic reform by appearing to solve the problem and would also stimulate
                            general belief that any future crisis would be met by another gold price
                            increase—increasing the instability of the system and the likelihood we
                            could no longer get much, if any, dollar financing.</p>
                        <p>The key countries in any reform effort are Germany, because it is the
                            strongest surplus country and will undoubtedly stay that way short of
                            major new East-West tensions, and France, because of the desire of the
                            rest of the Six for a common position. In fact, only France could
                            probably play a leadership role in forging a common U.S. position since
                            the others would fear and resent any German effort to “impose its view”
                            and the others do not have the necessary strength. The UK is not a
                            factor because it is financially prostrate and Japan simply does not
                            play a role commensurate with its economic power.</p>
                        <p>The outlook for German cooperation is cloudy. Their recent decision not
                            to revalue may be blamed on the coming election but it is not clear that
                            they will move even thereafter. The Germans are also moving very
                            cautiously on the size and even timing of <gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                                >SDR</gloss> activation.</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> remains important in
                            financial affairs after the September election, there can be only a

                            multilateral approach succeed. On the other hand, the bulk of informed
                            German opinion—including many businessmen and bankers—are coming to
                            understand that only upvaluation of the mark and greater flexibility of
                            exchange rates will enable Germany to avoid inflationary pressures from
                            abroad. SPD victory would hasten the likelihood of implementation of
                            these views but even then it would be uncertain.</p>

                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The answer to the first question depends on the cost of pursuing that
                            alternative. If we resolve not to let the present system constrain us
                            seriously—meaning that we are prepared to move to one of the other
                            options if it does—then I see no harm in doing so.</p>
                        <p>In practice, this means that we would answer the second question by
                            continuing to reduce our controls over private capital and our aid
                            programs and perhaps taking a more relaxed position on issues like the
                            German offset. We would not let external pressures force us into
                            policies undesirable in and of themselves. Resolve to pursue this course
                            will require steady nerves.</p>
                        <p>If forced to move to one of the other approaches, I would opt strongly
                            for suspension. I agree with the economic case made in the <persName

                            would seem to me less politically harmful in the longer run than an
                            increase in the gold price—and by forcing the Europeans to face some
                            difficult choices could perhaps even provide a new impetus toward
                            European integration.</p>

                            <p>The Council of Economic Advisers, which has participated in the
                                drafting of this paper, is in general agreement with its formulation
                                of the options and with its recommendations. In particular, I agree
                                that the evolutionary approach now being followed (option a) should
                                be pursued. I take a more positive view of the merits of limited
                                exchange rate flexibility than the paper does, but since the U.S.
                                dollar would not move under such a scheme, our bargaining position
                                in advocating this scheme is admittedly limited. It should
                                nevertheless be stressed that our hopes of establishing a less
                                crisis-prone international monetary system rest primarily on
                                achieving limited flexibility. The fear that an endorsement of
                                limited flexibility would further unsettle the foreign exchange
                                markets seems exaggerated, and it tends to induce inaction on this
                                matter.</p>
                            <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0380"/>
                            <p>I also agree with the paper in regarding the suspension of gold
                                convertibility (option b) as a major break in international
                                cooperation, and therefore not to be undertaken unless the
                                evolutionary approach turns out to be unpromising. In particular, I
                                do not support the view, implied in para. 56, that we should suspend
                                convertibility if the other countries are unwilling to activate more
                                than $2 billion in <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>’s (Special
                                Drawing Rights) per year. Although <gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                                    >SDR</gloss>’s will no doubt be an important addition to
                                international liquidity, this additional liquidity can make only a
                                modest contribution to the adjustment process by which nations with
                                different rates of price movements, different objectives of economic
                                policy, and different rates of technological development adjust to
                                each other. It is the present system’s inability to effect these
                                adjustments, by excessive rigidity of exchange rates, that is the
                                main cause of current troubles. Consequently I do not believe that a
                                large amount of <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>’s, while
                                desirable, should be regarded as the touchstone of success for the
                                evolutionary approach.</p>
                            <p>I agree with the report’s rejection of an increase in the gold price,
                                whether large or small. If it ever comes to a choice between options
                                b and c we should demonetize gold, which is what option b amounts
                                to.</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Balance of payments controls</hi>. The paper
                                    does not hold out any hope for a further relaxation of controls
                                    in the immediate future. While maintenance of controls is
                                    seemingly justified by the precarious state of our balance of
                                    payments, it is not clear that relaxation must await a return to
                                    equilibrium. In fact it is not clear how much controls
                                    contribute to reducing the deficit, and they do come at a heavy
                                    cost in other matters. A subcommittee of the <persName
                                        corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> group is working on
                                    this subject and you may want to express an interest in its
                                    results. Indeed, we might want to consider a phased relaxation
                                    of controls as a major policy objective in its own right. If
                                    this puts a strain on the international monetary system, it
                                    would be evidence that the system needs modification. If we do
                                    not press forward here, the momentum generated by the April 4
                                    relaxation may be lost, and this Administration may become no
                                    less committed to controls than its predecessor.</item>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi>. Although I agree that for the
                                    moment (say, through the summer) sterling should hold at its
                                    present parity, it would be most unwise to supply Britain with
                                    further credit. This would require Congressional approval. And
                                    it is probably not in the interest of the United Kingdom to go
                                    even further into debt. Moreover, there are indications that
                                    sterling has a long-term tendency to depreciate, which makes it
                                    an ideal candidate for the so-called crawling peg form of
                                    exchange rate adjustment. Whenever the next sterling crisis
                                    erupts, Britain should be encouraged to adopt such a device in
                                    order to avoid resorting to direct controls.</item>

                            <item>For guidance U.S. Missions in discussions of subject with
                                officials, our view is that satisfactory consensus can be reached in
                                July, or latest in August. It is natural that initial discussion of
                                activation amounts shows some range in initial positions. We
                                continue to believe that $4.5 billion a year for five years is
                                amount called for (a) to achieve reasonable reserve growth
                                objectives of both industrial and developing countries, (b) to
                                facilitate adjustment process, and (c) to assist in repayment of
                                reserve credits extended in past five years. Further progress toward
                                this view is needed, but seems achievable as various governments
                                focus on arithmetic of reserve needs and its implications.</item>

                            <item>FYI: A number of delegations accepted $4.5 billion a year as
                                amount of new reserves needed in all forms, but deducted anticipated
                                net new reserve creation due to anticipated resumption U.S. official
                                settlements deficits and possible net growth of reserve credit. This
                                contrary to our projections, which imply net reductions in reserves
                                on these two counts taken together. Further negotiations will
                                explore these differences of view. At this point we believe that
                                possibilities of agreement between present German-Italian $3 and
                                $4-1/2 billion in early years are good, and that we can hope to
                                reach some agreement for full period of five years. In latter
                                connection Japanese have emphasized and we concur that it is
                                important that legal staff of Fund produce promptly paper on options
                                open to Fund to adjust allocations for later years to allow for
                                subsequent selective quota increases. End FYI.</item>

                                    the link. Governor <persName corresp="#p_DJD2">Daane</persName>
                                    shared their concern but felt “that in case of some donor
                                    countries voluntary pledges of type suggested by Colombo could
                                    be appropriate, and that Group should continue study how achieve
                                    without linking liquidity creation and capital requirements.”

                        <p>Chairman Ossola of the Deputies appears to have indicated some
                            willingness to try to reach agreement on this proposal, if it would be
                            acceptable to the United States. The United States has not given him
                            encouragement to do so. The amount, totaling $10 billion in three years,
                            is somewhat larger than the figure of $3 billion for two or three years
                            mentioned by the German Delegation at the June Deputies Meeting. It is
                            considerably above the Belgian and Dutch figure, though it applies to a
                            shorter period than the Dutch proposal. It could conceivably be defended
                            by the Europeans as coinciding with the $10 billion figure discussed
                            last year, even though telescoped into a shorter time period. It is
                            conceivable that, if the Finance Ministers of the Six do not agree on a
                            more stringent position in their meeting on July 21-22, this alternative
                            could be accepted by the Deputies without an August Deputies Meeting or
                            an appeal to the Ministers. It is not certain that this could be done,
                            however, because of Dutch and Belgian resistance. There is no clear
                            additional sweetener for the Dutch and Belgians, unless it lies in
                            support for a conservative approach to quota increases, discussed
                            below.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>This position would result in $2 billion more of <gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                                >SDR</gloss>s than Alternative A in the first three years. The U.S.
                            share would be approximately $500 million, or conceivably more if some
                            members of the Fund did not participate in the <gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                                >SDR</gloss>s. (It is assumed in Alternatives A amp; B that the
                            amount of activation is fixed absolutely, and would not be increased if
                            additional participants joined in at a later date.)</p>
                        <p>While this position might conceivably be sold to the Europeans in July,
                            it seems more likely that adoption of Alternative B would lead to a
                            Deputies Meeting at the end of August 1969, for further negotiation. An
                            important question is whether the U.S. is likely to lose or gain if
                            agreement is postponed in July.</p>
                        <p>There are several reasons why postponement may prove disadvantageous to
                            the U.S. In the first place, allowing more time to elapse before
                            committing the European Deputies permits opposition elements in those
                            countries to organize more effective pressure against a substantial
                            activation figure. This opposition may result from political rivalries,
                            electoral strategy, or genuine fear that a large activation would
                            contribute to inflation or unduly impair international monetary
                            discipline. In the second place, by mid-August, if not earlier, the
                            unprecedentedly <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0385"/>large U.S.
                            liquidity deficit will become known to the Europeans. This could be
                            embarrassing to the European Deputies who are most inclined to take a
                            liberal view of activation, and cause them to be less venturesome in
                            leading their own governments. It appears to be well substantiated, for
                            example, that <persName corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ1">Schoellhorn</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> have already mentioned
                            activation figures which are about twice as high as the figures
                            generally talked about in other German Ministries and at lower levels in
                            the Bundesbank.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the possible advantages of deferring a decision until
                            August relate to the uncertain results of an appeal to Chancellor
                                <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName> during his August 7
                            visit to Washington and a judgment as to the effectiveness and
                            usefulness of a threat to insist upon a Ministerial Meeting at the end
                            of August.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">

                            </hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In this alternative a different approach would be taken arithmetically.
                            The amount proposed for <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> activation
                            would be based on the assumption that all members of the Fund would
                            participate, and the amount would be written down proportionately if the
                            actual participation were less than 100 percent of <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> membership. If at a later stage other
                            countries opted in, the amount allocated would be increased and the same
                            procedure would be followed if there were selective quota increases.
                            This means that the figures cited would not be a maximum, but could be
                            exceeded if there were selective quota increases, though presumably not
                            by a large amount. Under this alternative, the U.S. might propose $4-1/2
                            billion a year for three years, with decision on Year IV and Year V to
                            be taken before September 1971. The United States share would be about
                            $1,125 mil., and would not vary depending upon the number of
                            participants in a given year or the adoption of selective quota
                            increases.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">

                        </p>
                        <p>It may be recalled that the United States at present has legal authority
                            to participate during the initial activation in an amount up to our
                            present quota of $5,160 million. Over a five-year period, an annual
                            allocation of $1,125 million a year would be beyond our present
                            authority. This was pointed out to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DWB1"
                                >Dale</persName> by the Japanese Executive Director, whose
                            legislation apparently parallels ours. This may be true of some other
                            countries as well. For this reason it would be desirable to reduce the
                            U.S. asking figure to bring it within our present legal authority. In
                            this alternative, this is done by reducing the period to three
                            years.</p>
                        <p>This alternative also would quite probably mean no agreement at the July
                            meeting and a continuation of negotiations in August. At the August
                            meeting the United States would probably have to move <pb n="358"
                                xml:id="pg_358" facs="0386"/>toward Alternative A in order to reach
                            agreement, by reducing the amount. Under no conditions should the U.S.
                            agree to any activation period shorter than three years.</p>
                        <p>The considerations noted in Alternative B above would apply to this
                            alternative.</p>

                            possibility of an allocation for five years at the mid-point of a range

                            billion a year for five years. He indicated that an additional amount
                            might be added at the beginning of the period to make up for deficient
                            permanent reserve creation in recent years.</p>

                        <p>While the United States would have preferred to postpone a substantive
                            decision on the amount of general and selective quota increases in the
                            Fund, it now looks as though it may be necessary to reach a substantive
                            agreement on the main outlines of a quota increase in order to settle
                            the issue of <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> activation in July or
                            August of this year. Several alternative U.S. approaches are briefly
                            summarized below.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Alternative A</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>General increase of 15 percent in <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                            quotas with selective increases totaling not more than 10 percent of
                            present quotas, or about $2.1 billion. The United States could either
                            (1) take no selective increase, (2) take enough increase to maintain its
                            voting power, or (3) take its proportionate share of an overall 10
                            percent figure for world-wide selective increases. It is estimated that
                            Alternative A (1) might result in gold sales of about $600 million, with
                            Alternative A (3) adding another $75 million, for the U.S. selective
                            increase, for which the United States would receive gold tranche claims.
                            A <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0387"/>15 percent increase in our
                            gold tranche would amount to about $193.5 million. The net reserve loss
                            we could suffer could therefore be about $400 million, though our
                            conditional drawing right would be enlarged by about $775 million. These
                            estimates are based on the assumption that about 18 countries would not
                            convert dollars into United States gold to make the requisite payments
                            to the Fund, but would use their own resources.</p>

                        <p>This approach follows the suggestions of major European countries at the
                            last meeting of the Deputies. It should be readily saleable to the
                            Europeans, but could encounter rather strong opposition from the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> staff and the Executive Directors of
                            the non-Ten countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DWB1">Dale</persName>
                            indicates that the Executive Directors of these non-Ten countries appear
                            to be insistent on a 20 to 25 percent general increase for their own
                            countries. While he does not think that they would openly refuse to go
                            along with <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> activation if we
                            supported Alternative A, the Europeans would probably realize that no
                            agreement on quotas might be reached on this basis, at least without
                            long and acrimonious negotiations. This might affect the willingness of
                            the French, Italians, Japanese and Canadians to reach an understanding
                            on <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> activation.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Under this approach there would be a general increase of 15 percent for
                            the members of the Group of Ten plus not more than their share of
                            selective increases totaling globally no more than 10 percent of
                            existing quotas, or about $2.1 million. The rest of the world, however,
                            would receive uniform quota increases of 20 percent, plus a
                            proportionate share of the overall 10 percent selective increase.</p>
                        <p>We would estimate that this alternative would cost the United States

                                >IMF</gloss> staff, in an effort to deal with what is felt to be a
                            European objection to a substantial increase in the United Kingdom
                            quota. It is also felt that the United Kingdom is not enthusiastic about
                            a substantial rise in its quota.</p>
                        <p>The advantages of this approach would be to satisfy both the Europeans
                            and the non-members of the Ten with respect to the size of their general
                            quota increases.</p>
                        <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0388"/>
                        <p>On the other hand this approach continues and emphasizes a trend in the
                            Fund towards expanding the drawing rights of the non-<gloss
                                target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> more rapidly than those of the Group
                            of Ten countries, and thus probably reduce the liquidity of the Fund. To
                            some extent this tendency would be offset by large selective increases
                            to some <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> members. The United Kingdom
                            would find its voting power reduced, and the United States would also be
                            in this position unless it elected for some share in the selective quota
                            increases. To maintain its voting power, it would need to take a
                            selective increase of something like $400 million. It is also worth
                            bearing in mind that a reduction in the relative share in <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> quotas for the United States means over
                            time a fairly significant cumulative loss of <gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                                >SDR</gloss> allocations, which are proportionate to relative quota

                            $810 million in gold sales to the Fund, against which the United States
                            would receive an additional gold tranche claim of $258 million plus any
                            allowance for selective increases, and additional credit tranche drawing

                        <p>This approach would maintain the principle of uniform treatment of all

                            increase, and could probably be made acceptable as a minimum figure to

                            countries.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand some difficulty might be encountered in gaining
                            European acquiescence to such a figure, resulting in European delay in

                            score. Adoption of this position might increase the likelihood of an

                            and quota questions, although it is true that in the past the Europeans
                            have proved reluctant to maintain a strong position in the face of a
                            fairly determined stance on the part of the developing countries.</p>

                        <p>This would be a frankly compromise position, calling for a general quota
                            enlargement of 17-1/2 percent, midway between the European maximum and
                            the indicated minimum of the non-Ten countries. As before, the selective
                            increases would be held within 10 percent of quotas.</p>
                        <p>We estimate the United States gold loss under this alternative at about
                            $750 million. Our gold tranche claim would rise by about $225 million,
                            plus any allowance for selective increases and our credit tranche
                            drawing rights by something over $900 million, plus adjustment for a

                                meeting that the most urgent problem facing the West at this point
                                was the international economic and monetary situation, and in that
                                general picture the strength and position of the dollar was crucial.
                                He alluded specifically to the so-called French war against the
                                dollar and smilingly he said that the possibilities of any such war
                                at this time were non-existent; that the franc was in no position to
                                challenge the dollar; and that, in fact, the economic strength of
                                the US and our determination to prevent inflation and protect the
                                status of the dollar was crucial to all the Western countries.

                            <item>I asked <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> whether the
                                French would be of a mind to facilitate international monetary
                                equilibrium by participating in the Special Drawing Rights.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> responded that
                                there were two aspects to this question: one was the principle
                                involved, and the second was the quantity. With regard to the
                                principle, he pointed out that <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362"
                                    facs="0390"/>France has consistently emphasized the usefulness
                                of gold as an instrument which enforces discipline. He himself was
                                not a devote of the extreme theories on gold: i.e., he was not a
                                doctrinaire supporter of Jacques Rueff’s ideas, but that in lieu of
                                gold, self-disciplinary actions had to be taken. In this connection,
                                of course, he reemphasized the necessity for US to do something

                                else. In response I repeated my personal conviction that the US had

                        <p>3. During negotiations leading up to consensus, Common Market (minus
                            France) first put forward proposal for $2.5 billion per year for three
                            years. U.S. pulled them up to $3 billion per year for three years and in
                            final round of bargaining got first-year figure up to $3.5 billion in
                            interest of psychological effect on exchange markets. While all nine
                            parties to agreement will confirm Ministerial approval to Chairman
                            Ossola, in fact only four are on ad referendum basis: U.S., Canada,
                            Germany and Netherlands.</p>
                        <p>4. Strictly FYI: As indicated para 1 above, France did not associate
                            itself with agreement. However, informal talks suggest French adherence
                            in September, although agreement on figure which is relatively high by
                            Common Market standards may introduce complication into this
                            timetable.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>5. Chairman proposed consensus along following lines. Members of <gloss
                                target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> will support an over-all increase in
                            quotas in the order of magnitude of 30 percent (plus or minus three
                            percentage points). This would support selective increases that would
                            bring quotas more in line with the economic position of countries.
                            Chairman said this consensus also implied (A) that quotas should be
                            raised as soon as possible and that annual <gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                                >SDR</gloss> allocations would then reflect the new quota
                            distribution and (B) that the increase in quotas should not affect the
                            General Arrangements to Borrow.</p>
                        <p>6. In discussion, <persName corresp="#p_VLE1">Van Lennep</persName>
                            (Netherlands) made effort to narrow the parenthetical range of 6 percent
                            with 30 percent as center to range of $28.5 billion to $31.5 billion.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJD2">Daane</persName> (U.S.) stressed need
                            for wider 27-33 percent range to have needed flexibility to work out
                            individual quotas in <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> executive
                            board. <persName corresp="#p_VLE1">Van Lennep</persName> accepted wider
                            margin on interpretation by Morse (U.K.) that restraints to increases
                            would increase as figure moved farther from 30 percent within 6 percent
                            range.</p>
                        <p>7. De Strycker (Belgium) stressed that the consensus (A) did not imply
                            any approval of the “split-level” method of general increase or any
                            other formula for dividing total quota increases; (B) no understanding
                            was implied as to any specific national quota increase and none was
                            approved; and (C) no quantitative figure of any kind was being approved,
                            except the 30 percent order of magnitude. <persName corresp="#p_DJD2"
                                >Daane</persName> (U.S.) supported Belgians and entered reservation
                            as to any sharp reduction <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0393"/>in
                            U.S. own relative share, such as that shown in some Fund tables that had
                            been discussed on previous day. While we would accept the over-all 30
                            percent with its range, the only agreement on individual quotas that we
                            would accept was that we would inform our Executive Director as to
                            specific quantitative position on all figures. Larre (France) complained
                            that <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> should be more specific, and
                            that increase of 33 percent was needed to reach over-all increase of $7
                            billion. Larre felt that consensus left too much flexibility. Chairman,
                            nevertheless, concluded there was consensus on the flexible position he
                            had outlined.</p>

                            currencies, including the dollar. In his August 9 weekly report on
                            international finance to the President, Council of Economic Advisers
                            Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MCPW1">Paul McCracken</persName> thought
                            the dollar would be unaffected, doubted the mark would be appreciated,
                            mused on how much support the United States should give the pound, and
                            wondered how the devaluation would affect planning for Secretary
                            Kennedy’s speech on monetary reform, including improvement in the
                            exchange rate system. (Ibid., Box 215, Council of Economic Advisers)
                            (Regarding Kennedy’s speech, which was given on September 30 at the

                            the mark would not be revalued until after the German elections in
                            September proved correct. Following heavy speculative flows on September
                            22 and 23, Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KKG1">Kiesinger</persName>
                            on September 24 called for a closing of German foreign exchange markets
                            through the election on September 28, and the mark was allowed to float
                            on September 30.</p>

                            suspend the dollar’s convertibility to gold, and recommended that the

                            transmitting another weekly international finance report from Chairman

                            with a paragraph explaining that the Treasury Department had
                            backgrounded key financial writers on Secretary Kennedy’s forthcoming
                            speech on international study of greater exchange rate flexibility. He
                            referred to a <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> front-page story of
                            that day that noted the President’s personal involvement in the
                            initiative. He concluded: “we are now fairly clearly on the record as
                            seeking a negotiated solution to one of the key problems of the system.”

                            scenarios for suspending the convertibility of the dollar to gold; there
                            is no indication that it went forward to the President. (Both ibid.)</p>

                        <p>In the remaining weeks prior to the German election, it is evidently
                            important to avoid initiatives which might be construed as exerting
                            pressures on the German electorate.<note n="2" xml:id="d137fn2">The
                                election was scheduled for September 28.</note> It is no less
                            important, however, to <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0396"/>maintain
                            the momentum which has been built up for international monetary reform,
                            to assert U.S. leadership, and to prevent the reassertion of natural
                            tendencies to avoid rocking the boat while nebulously hoping for the
                            best. As decided at your June 26 meeting,<note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3"
                                >See <ref target="#d131">Document 131</ref>.</note> a major
                            initiative towards greater exchange rate flexibility should be presented
                            at the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> meetings (which take place
                            immediately after the German elections). While avoiding advocacy of any
                            particular scheme, this initiative should suggest that the United States
                            considers such a reform to hold promise for eliminating some of the
                            patent defects in the present system.</p>
                        <p>Because of the central position of the United States in the international
                            monetary system, and our great interest in monetary stability, it is
                            essential for us to provide leadership in the quest for a better
                            adjustment mechanism. Without our leadership, there is a tendency for
                            other countries to hold back from innovations. At the same time, we
                            should recognize that, because we want the dollar to remain the pivot of
                            the entire system (and hence not subject to flexibility), we would in
                            effect be suggesting to other countries that they consider amending
                            their exchange rate policies without our having to make a similar
                            change. In this situation, it is appropriate for us to make our view
                            clear, but to avoid exerting strong pressures on other countries to
                            adopt the innovations which we consider desirable.</p>
                        <p>The circumstances are favorable for a U.S. initiative at the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> meeting later this month. There is
                            widespread recognition that present methods of balance of payments
                            adjustment are inadequate. The exchange markets are temporarily quiet,
                            but strong doubts about the future of the German mark and the pound
                            sterling remain. The liquidity problem has become much less urgent,
                            thanks to the recent agreement on Special Drawing Rights.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d137fn4">See <ref target="#d135">Document 135</ref>.</note>
                            Several authorities in Italy, Germany, Japan and France have expressed
                            interest (sometimes amounting to explicit advocacy) in greater
                            flexibility of exchange rates. American businessmen and bankers have
                            become increasingly aware of the disadvantages of frequent monetary
                            crises and are willing to consider alternatives to present arrangements.
                            The press is full of rumors and speculation on our official attitude
                            towards reform.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I should mention that a U.S. initiative on the exchange rate
                            mechanism would be truly an achievement of your Administration. Although
                            the final agreement on international liquidity was completed this year,
                            the original initiative is generally credited to the previous
                            Administration. Consequently unfavorable comparisons would be <pb
                                n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0397"/>invited if we did not come up
                            with new ideas at the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> meeting.
                            Needless to say a more compelling argument for these ideas is that they
                            will serve our own interests and those of the world as a whole.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I suggest that the Administration make a strong and forward
                            looking statement, at the forthcoming annual meetings of the
                            International Monetary Fund, on needed changes and strengthening of the
                            international monetary system. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> could make such a statement timed to avoid any
                            relationship to the German election. It would, I believe, be received
                            sympathetically by member nations generally.</p>

                            perspective. In substance, the opposition has differing origins. Some
                            officials simply think that greater exchange rate flexibility will
                            create more problems than it will solve. Others, particularly those
                            whose currencies are under pressure, are concerned that open discussion
                            of greater flexibility will expose them to increased speculation and
                            reserve losses. Still others are suspicious of our motives in raising
                            this issue at this time, reading into our interest in exchange rate
                            flexibility a defeatist attitude toward dealing with our internal
                            inflation.</p>
                        <p>In contrast to these foreign official views, greater exchange rate
                            flexibility has wide support in the academic community, has attracted
                            interest in the business community, and has strong appeal to certain
                            members of Congress. In the end, I believe most—if not all—of the
                            leading countries will accede to our request for international study. I
                            believe that our interests, and indeed theirs in the longer run, will be
                            served by proceeding with such an exercise. However, the foreign
                            official response does emphasize the importance of proceeding in this
                            matter with considerable care respecting the reservations and
                            sensibilities of our friends to elicit their cooperation.</p>
                        <p>For that reason, in asking for study, I plan to emphasize (1) that
                            careful study is required, and this means that no one need fear early
                            and potentially disturbing changes; (2) that we do not have preconceived
                            ideas as to the “best solution"—at the same time we must rule out
                            certain alternatives that would clearly be unworkable or work to the
                            disadvantage of the United States; and (3) that the U.S. does not look
                            upon greater exchange flexibility as an alternative to continued pursuit
                            of anti-inflation policies domestically. I am now working on a draft
                            speech for the Bank/Fund Meetings which I trust will make these points
                            clear.</p>

                        <p>Another major international monetary crisis is quite possible in the next
                            few weeks.</p>
                        <p>Speculation that Germany will revalue after its election on September 28
                            has already begun to precipitate massive new inflows into Germany ($1
                            billion in the last two weeks) and they are likely to accelerate
                            immediately after the election. The <gloss target="#t_SDP1">SDP</gloss>,
                            which openly favors revaluation, is doing well at the polls and there is
                            a growing belief that it may gain in strength. This would give it a
                            greater voice in an eventual coalition government, which is still the
                            most probable outcome. There will be widespread speculation whoever
                            looks like a winner, however, because the economic (if not the
                            political) case for revaluation is so clear.</p>
                        <p>The UK and Belgium continue as the potential weak spots, although the UK
                            is doing well for the moment as the result of good trade figures.</p>
                        <p>Italy is the latest problem, losing $250 million so far this month.
                            Sweden has also been suffering losses which are large for it. And France
                            has begun to lose again, only a month after its devaluation.</p>
                        <p>Any of these countries might conclude—as did France last month—that it is
                            useless to defend exchange rates which are unviable in the long term
                            without German revaluation. If any of them devalue or float their
                            exchange rates, numerous other countries would follow. Only a few
                            countries beside Germany could then avoid devaluation. The result would
                            be a severe disruption of the international monetary system and a
                            further weakening of the U.S. competitive position, already jeopardized
                            by inflation.</p>

                            forces which emerges from it.</p>

                                we learned that any major country planned to devalue or float,
                                announce our support for any sound currencies under pressure, and
                                call for basic reforms of the monetary system. This would be an
                                effort to pre-empt the collapse of the system by heading off the

                            <item>We could suspend gold convertibility of the dollar in response to
                                a forced devaluation or float of the British pound or another major
                                currency, declaring our readiness to support financially other major
                                currencies while basic reforms of the system are worked out. This
                                would be an effort to limit the scope of the breakdown of the
                                system. Secretary Kennedy’s paper implicitly favors this

                        </p>
                        <p>We cannot decide on a precise course of action in advance of the crisis.
                            However, we should have a clear idea of the direction in which we want
                            the international monetary system to move and, in light of that, how we
                            should respond in a crisis situation.</p>
                        <p>You therefore need an interagency paper on the options we face and our
                            choices in choosing among them. And you need it soon, because the crisis
                            may be upon us quickly and because our position should be set before
                            next week’s annual meeting here of the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss>, as background for the many talks our people will be
                            having with foreign financial officials.</p>
                        <p>There is also one immediate problem. It was agreed at your June 26
                            meeting with your top financial and foreign policy advisors that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> should make an
                            early public call for an intensified official international study of
                            greater exchange rate flexibility.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary has not implemented this decision, however. And—in response
                            to criticism from some foreign central bankers—he is now wavering over
                            how firmly to do so even at the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                            meeting. (See his <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0402"/>memo at Tab

                                noted that the sense of the June 26 meeting with the President “was
                                for a much clearer and more urgent call to action on this issue and
                                three months have already elapsed.” <persName corresp="#p_BCF1"

                        <p>Two of the three components of the U.S. international monetary policy
                            agreed at your June 26 meeting with your financial and foreign policy

                                >SDR</gloss>s has been decided and a tenable exchange rate structure
                            has been achieved through the French devaluation, German revaluation,
                            and UK turn-around into sizable surplus.</p>

                        <p>In addition, the third point—greater exchange rate flexibility—has moved

                        <p>There is thus an excellent chance that the international monetary system
                            will remain calm for at least six months and perhaps much longer. The
                            task now is to use the available time to improve the basic structure of
                            the system so that relative calm can prevail indefinitely. That task is
                            underway with the study of exchange rate flexibility.</p>
                        <p>Another significant effect of the recent developments is that both France
                            and Germany have now effectively withdrawn from the Common Agricultural
                            Policy by fully offsetting the impact on their agricultural sectors of
                            their exchange rate changes. The <gloss target="#t_CAP1"

                            suspended for all practical purposes. It is quite unclear how and when
                            the Europeans can put it back together. This raises important questions

                                    there was very strong sentiment against any direct linkage of an

                                    decisions to create Special Drawing Rights should be entirely
                                    governed by monetary considerations and should not be subjected

                        <p>Chairman Ossola recalled the September agreement of the Deputies for a
                            total increase in <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> quotas of about 30
                            percent plus or minus 3 percent.<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">For

                                Monetary Fund, 1976), pp. 287-305.</note> It was implicit that new
                            quotas should be the basis for the second annual allocation of Special
                            Drawing Rights. It was also desirable not to modify substantially the
                            relationship between Group of Ten countries and the developing countries
                            in the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. In September figures had
                            been mentioned by a number of countries, and a tabulation has been
                            discussed which showed the U.S. at $6300 million. The United States, the
                            Belgians, and some others did not accept the figures given for them in
                            the September <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> table. Revised figures
                            for these countries, plus the earlier objectives of France, Italy,
                            Japan, and Canada would call for a larger global increase than the
                            amount agreed upon in September.</p>
                        <p>Chairman Ossola suggested a possible avenue of agreement involving two
                            principles: <list>

                        <p>The Chairman said he had asked the Fund staff to prepare a table which

                                    this produced figures satisfactory to most <gloss

                                    an overall increase of about 35 percent. A table showing these
                                    results was distributed.<note n="3" xml:id="d142fn3">Not

                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Inamura (Japan) accepted the proposal. Nield (U.K.) said the U.K. would
                            accept the two-tier principle in the Chairman’s ingenious variation.
                            Handfield-Jones (Canada) called attention to the fact that the 8 percent
                            reduction factor had not been applied to the middle group of industrial
                            countries not included in the Group of Ten. If this were done, the total
                            increase might be reduced to about 34 percent. Chairman Ossola favored
                            this suggestion. <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Larre</persName> (Fr) would
                            accept the table if all other members of <gloss target="#t_G101"
                                >G-10</gloss> accepted it.</p>
                        <p>Pieske (Ger) said the Group of Ten should abide by the agreement of last
                            July. This agreement was part of an overall understanding on <gloss
                                target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> allocations.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d142fn4">See <ref target="#d135">Document 135</ref>.</note>
                            We should not change this agreement after the <gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                                >SDR</gloss> part of the understanding has been implemented. There
                            is no need to go beyond 30 percent plus or minus 3 percent. Any <gloss
                                target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> ceiling appears like dictation to
                            other <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> members, regardless of the
                            amount. The Canadian proposal provides no guarantee that intermediate
                            countries would really accept the 8 percent reduction. To the Germans,
                            the proposal put forward some time ago by Mr.
                                <persName>Roelandts</persName> of Belgium in the Fund calling for a
                            31 percent overall increase would be acceptable. The Germans would favor
                            adopting a two-tier system openly rather than in the disguised form
                            proposed by the Chairman. Countries which have raised their quota
                            targets since last July bear heavy responsibility for breaking down the
                            agreement of last July.</p>
                        <p>Chairman Ossola pointed out that Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and the
                            U.S. did not accept the figures put forward last July for their
                            countries. The July proposal was put forward under great pressure and we
                            had not realized all of the implications. If necessary, we could force
                            the non-<gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> members of the Fund to
                            accept a reduction of 8 percent since we have a majority in the
                            Executive Board.</p>
                        <p>Palumbo (Italy) accepted the Chairman’s proposal, noting that it provided
                            for a $1 billion figure for the Italian quota, as requested in July.
                            Joge (Sweden) said he would have preferred to limit selective increases
                            to only a few countries. However, because the great majority want
                            selective increases, he would accept the $325 million figure shown for
                            Sweden. He thought the other Nordic countries would accept a reduction
                            of 8 percent, and would be glad to have the two-tier system concealed as
                            in this proposal.</p>
                        <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0409"/>
                        <p>De Strycker (Belg) continued to object to the two-tier system, but this
                            proposal could be modified to avoid two classes of countries. 35 percent
                            was a very high percentage increase. The world was not in a phase of
                            general deflation. To reconcile differences, he suggested a two-stage
                            quota increase, with a first stage covering only three years and the
                            second stage the following two years. This would mean taking the
                            proposal of the Chairman, but giving each country only 3/5ths of its
                            total now. The Chairman thought the two-tranche idea of Belgium might be
                            attractive.</p>
                        <p>Kessler (Neth) also was against going beyond the 33 percent limit. In the
                            selective quota calculation, the $5 billion or 23 percent of the quotas
                            was so divided that the developing countries got less than 23 percent
                            and the Group of Ten got far more than 23 percent, amounting to about 30
                            percent. The scheme has the merit of making it possible for the U.K. to
                            go down to 15 percent overall increase. He had no quarrel with the
                            mechanism of the scheme, but the 8 percent reduction was too little. The
                            Netherlands would go down to $675 million, or about a 30 percent
                            increase. In response, Polak (<gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>)
                            argued that the selective calculation is not as arbitrary as Kessler
                            suggested. The 25 percent general increase is important to non-members
                            of the Ten.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName> (Ger) urged the necessity
                            of insisting on pursuing the Canadian suggestion and reducing the middle
                            group of industrial countries by 8 percent. However, 8 percent was still
                            too small a reduction, and he suggested a reduction of 10 percent with
                            some rounding up here and there, to be applied also to the middle group
                            of countries. Ossola (Italy) thought that Italy and some others would
                            not be satisfied with a 10 percent reduction, but asked for the table to
                            be prepared and circulated.<note n="5" xml:id="d142fn5">Not

                            <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> (U.S.) reminded the group
                            that the U.S. had been reluctant to agree to the earlier ceiling because
                            of a feeling that more leeway would be needed, but was equally reluctant
                            to abandon the agreement on the 33 percent limit, related to the <gloss
                                target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> allocation understanding. The U.S. had
                            never agreed to the figure proposed for it in July. All objective
                            calculations show the United States entitled to a substantial increase.
                            The United States concluded that the earlier figure would erode our
                            relative position in the Fund too much. Any solution along the lines of
                            Roelandts’ proposal, mentioned by the Germans, would bring the U.S. down
                            too low and was entirely unacceptable.</p>

                                target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> accepting small adjustments all
                            around. While no one would obtain his target figure, the desired
                            relative position of <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0410"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> members could be attained. The U.S.
                            might consider a small reduction in the U.S. figure to get within the 33
                            percent limit. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> saw
                            problems with the Canadian suggestion. He thought the middle countries
                            would not accept it without supplementary concessions by the Group of
                            Ten.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said that we had never
                            liked the two-tier system, but this was not a matter of life and death.
                            We preferred the disguised two-tier system and had no difficulty with
                            the proposed approach to calculating quotas. We would not stand in the
                            way of a solution.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said the quota increases
                            also raised the matter of gold mitigation.<note n="6" xml:id="d142fn6">
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> members were expected to
                                subscribe 25 percent of any quota increase to the Fund in gold,
                                sometimes a problem for members that did not hold significant gold
                                reserves. <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> quota increases
                                sometimes led countries to exchange currency holdings for U.S.
                                monetary gold, creating a drain on the U.S. gold reserves.
                                Mitigation concerned strategies and procedures for dealing with
                                meeting the gold subscription of any quota increase. See de Vries,
                                    <hi rend="italic">The International Monetary Fund 1966-1971: The
                                    System Under Stress, Volume I: Narrative</hi>, pp.
                                297-298.</note> It was of some direct concern to the U.S., and any
                            solution here was dependent on a satisfactory solution of the mitigation
                            problem. He suggested a discussion of mitigation at this point before
                            returning to the quota question.</p>
                        <p>Chairman Ossola accepted this suggestion, and said he was greatly
                            encouraged by the first exchange of views. In view of the short time
                            available before lunch, he suggested another meeting of the Deputies in
                            the afternoon.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName> (Ger) said he was not
                            sure there was any chance of getting any further this afternoon, but he
                            and Ossola could talk to <persName corresp="#p_SJ1"
                                >Schoellhorn</persName>, who was arriving about 2:45 p.m. We should
                            not have a meeting unless we could make further progress.</p>
                        <p>Ossola argued the great importance of reaching agreement today.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Larre</persName> (Fr) complained that the
                                <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> discussion was on the verge of
                            breakdown. This should not be allowed to happen because of the small
                            difference between 33 percent and 34.8 percent under the scheme.</p>
                        <p>Chairman Ossola then brought up the subject of mitigation. Primary
                            mitigation had been to some extent handled by installment payments and
                            special drawings during the previous quota increase. There should be
                            credit tranche drawings only if justified for other reasons.
                            Installments might be permitted if requested, but he thought most
                            countries would not so request because of their desire to have their
                            quotas adjusted quickly in order to receive their full share of <gloss
                                target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s. Secondary mitigation had cost the
                            reserve centers about $500 million last time, and this had been
                            mitigated by special deposits of gold in the amount of $350 million and
                            by special gold operations <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0411"
                            />under which countries bought gold from a country having a super gold
                            tranche claim on the Fund, and the Fund restored the positions of these
                            countries by selling gold back to them in return for their currencies.
                            The previous deposit scheme was unpalatable to some of the Group of Ten
                            now, but perhaps the triangular arrangement could be agreed upon. The
                            amount of secondary mitigation was somewhere around $600 million.</p>
                        <p>Polak (<gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>) explained that the suggested
                            mitigation gold sale procedure comprised three stages. For example,
                            India might buy gold from Germany with dollars and pay the gold to the
                            Fund. In the second stage the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> would
                            purchase DMs with gold. The third stage would be stretched out over time
                            and would permit more DMs to be used in drawings than would otherwise be
                            the case so that Germany could restore its <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> position and reduce its dollar holdings. The end result
                            is that the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> receives payment in
                            usable currency rather than in gold, equivalent to 25 percent of the
                            quota increase.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> (U.S.) said the problem
                            is not primary mitigation though this may arise for some countries. Our
                            concern is to have a permanent form of secondary mitigation. The most
                            natural solution would be to pay out Special Drawing Rights directly to
                            the Fund instead of gold. Minister Colombo had regretted that this was
                            not now possible. It would be feasible, if generally supported, to amend
                            the Fund Articles to make this possible and to obtain legislative
                            sanction simultaneously with legislative approval of quotas. This would
                            tidy up the <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> agreement. He put this
                            idea forward for consideration of the Group.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> also recognized that the
                            recent Fund Staff proposal would be adequate. The drawings in the third
                            step cited by Polak could in fact begin in advance of the gold payments
                            to the Fund. A number of countries could be used as intermediaries. The
                            United States might or might not play such a role dependent upon the
                            wish of others. What we need is agreement in principle that the
                            Executive Board will work out a mitigation plan on this basis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName> (Ger) thought it might be
                            better that the Fund take in <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s
                            instead of useable currency, but it would be odd to amend the new <gloss
                                target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> plan so quickly to permit this. He was
                            not sure this was a practicable procedure. We should, however, explore
                            the method suggested by the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Staff.
                            Germany has participated in these mitigation gold transactions before
                            and would have no difficulty in permitting the DM to be used as an
                            intermediary. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> (U.S.)
                            intervened briefly to clarify the point that we could obtain much the
                            same result as an amendment by encouraging countries to repay the Fund
                            in <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s. Then the Fund would end up with
                                <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s instead of gold, and this
                            provided a certain degree of logic to the whole procedure.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJ3">Morse</persName> (U.K.) thought it would be
                            logical for the present gold payment to the Fund to be made in <gloss
                                target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s, but this had been specifically
                            eliminated during the negotiations. He would now be content with the
                            procedure outlined by Mr. <persName>Polak</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Larre</persName> (Fr) saw a contrast between
                            the rigidity of quota positions and the laxity with which people
                            contemplated amendments to the <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> plan.
                            The ink on the <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> amendment was barely
                            dry and we were talking about amending the earlier understanding. Such
                            an amendment is premature. After three years, we can tell whether the
                                <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> has replaced gold in central
                            banks. The only feasible proposal is the Polak procedure which (a)
                            conforms to the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> rules, (b) has been
                            used in the past, and (c) avoids disruption for gold holders. However,
                            every member of the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> that holds gold
                            should be eligible as an intermediary.</p>
                        <p>Chairman Ossola noted that at least two countries have spoken favorably
                            of the amendment to permit payment in <gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                                >SDR</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Larre</persName> (Fr) suggested that
                            countries must give up something of value when they receive a quota
                            increase. Kessler (Neth) suggested that countries be permitted to
                            purchase gold from the intermediary only when they have no gold or have
                            a rather small percentage of gold in their reserves. He added that we
                            might provide for some gold transactions with gold producers in
                            connection with mitigation. In this way, the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> could recover gold.</p>
                        <p>De Strycker (Belg) saw prima facie logic to permitting quota payments in
                                <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s, but there are two major
                            drawbacks. This could mean that $1.7 to $2 billion of <gloss
                                target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s would be paid into the Fund and thus a
                            very large amount of <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s would move
                            rather quickly from the Fund to be absorbed by surplus countries.
                            Secondly, the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> would be deprived of
                            gold, which gives a guarantee that the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> can get the currency it requires.</p>
                        <p>Joge (Sweden) had no objection to the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                            Staff method. Permission for direct payment in <gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                                >SDR</gloss>s would be a more direct method. The world’s attitude
                            toward <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s will be largely determined
                            by the attitudes of the Group of Ten authorities. If such payment were
                            permissible, however, he was not sure he would recommend payment in
                                <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s instead of gold.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName> (Ger) strongly supported
                            the Swedish view that the status of <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s
                            depends on the attitude of the <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss>
                            countries. He was not absolutely certain that Germany would choose
                                <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s instead of gold if permitted to
                            do so since the <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> is a gold
                            certificate bearing 1-1/2 percent interest. The Fund could procure
                            usable currencies with <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s just as well
                            as with gold. There is no real danger that <gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                                >SDR</gloss>s will become illiquid because of reaching the
                            acceptance limits. However, it is not necessary to push the amendment
                            now. It is satisfactory to obtain pragmatic results.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> (U.S.) said the
                            inclination of the U.S. might well be to pay gold rather than Special
                            Drawing Rights even if the latter were permissible. The mitigation
                            problem was not essentially a matter of gold as such but resulted from
                            the circumstance that quota payments to the Fund would produce pressure
                            on U.S. reserves, however composed. Concerning arrangements with
                            gold-producing countries, <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>
                            referred to having spent some time during the year exploring the
                            problems of the gold producers with them. This had made it plain to him
                            that we cannot link that problem with mitigation at this stage. He saw
                            no practical way to do so at this time.</p>
                        <p>Chairman Ossola summarized the results of the meeting as follows: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>Primary mitigation is not a problem with which the countries
                                    around the table are concerned;</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>There was a rather widespread desire that Special Drawing
                                    Rights be usable instead of gold, but a recognition that it is
                                    impracticable to insert such an amendment into the ratification
                                    of quota increases. It was not clear that countries would in
                                    fact use Special Drawing Rights instead of gold if permitted to
                                    do so. We should use the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                                    Staff technique of mitigation gold transactions without
                                    restricting its use to a particular country. The Fund should be
                                    left to determine which countries were entitled to use this
                                    procedure and which currencies could serve as
                                    intermediaries;</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>There should be no connection between mitigation and
                                    arrangements with gold-producing countries, which is a separate
                                    problem.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Chairman Ossola then pressed again for an afternoon meeting but <persName
                                corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName> (Ger) again suggested that this
                            matter be left open until it could be ascertained whether it would be
                            useful to have the meeting. The Chairman suggested that the matter might
                            be taken up again at the time of the EPC meeting. Polak (<gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>) said this would be very difficult. The
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> could make a proposal along
                            these lines, but it would take a few weeks to clarify the reaction of
                            the other developed countries. There was little time left to reach
                            agreement by December 31. Chairman Ossola was very reluctant to leave
                            the decision to be worked out in other bodies without reaching unanimous
                            agreement in the Deputies. Polak (<gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>)
                            said that if the group wanted to agree they should do so today. He did
                            not think the Executive Directors could be asked to delay further
                            consideration of the matter until after the EPC meeting.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> (U.S.) noted that he
                            recognized the procedural and psychological difficulties of presently
                            introducing an <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> amendment. However,
                            he did not want to associate himself at this point with the Chairman’s
                            use of the term “impracticable.” The Chairman agreed that “difficulty”
                            could be a better description.</p>

                        <p>Following considerable informal negotiation, the Executive Directors of
                            the Fund were formally charged at the Annual Governors’ Meeting early in
                            October to complete a general review of Fund quotas by the end of
                            December and to make recommendations for appropriate increases. The
                            Directors completed this process on December 24. The Fund will probably
                            announce the results tomorrow, for December 31 newspapers.</p>
                        <p>The over-all increase in quotas recommended will be approximately $7.6
                            billion, compared to present quotas of some $21.4 billion. The potential
                            increase will thus be about 35 percent.</p>
                        <p>This proposed increase is consistent with our broad program for
                            international monetary reform, as outlined to you last Summer.<note

                        <p>The new quota recommended for the United States is $6,700 million, an
                            increase by almost 30 percent from the present quota of $5,160 million.
                            Since the U.S. quota will increase by a smaller than average proportion,
                            the U.S. share of total Fund quotas will be modestly reduced, from the
                            present 24.2 percent to 23.2 percent.</p>
                        <p>The share of the main industrial countries (the Group of Ten) in total
                            quotas will be approximately the same in the future as now,
                            approximately 61 percent. This reflects an increase in the weight of the
                            Common Market countries. The quota share of the developing countries has
                            been protected against much of a reduction, although the statistical
                            calculations traditionally used by the Fund in determining quotas would
                            have indicated a significant reduction. The share of developing
                            countries will fall from 28.3 percent to about 27.3 percent.</p>

                        <p>Quota increases must normally be paid for 25 percent in gold and 75
                            percent in the member’s own currency. The U.S. quota increase will
                            require a gold payment of $385 million and a payment in dollar
                            instruments of $1,155 million. Many other countries, especially the
                            larger industrial countries (except perhaps Japan), expect to make the
                            required gold payment from their own holdings. However, a number of
                            smaller countries would have to buy gold to make the payment, presumably
                            from the United States. In order to mitigate the effect of such gold
                            purchases on U.S. reserves, the Fund has worked out rather complex
                            procedures to “steer” the gold back to where it was bought.<note n="3"

                            fall in U.S. gold holdings of up to an estimated $600-$700 million,
                            which would otherwise have occurred.</p>
                        <p>The U. S. quota increase in the Fund will require authorizing legislation
                            in 1970. However, these operations are considered as an exchange of
                            monetary assets and have no budgetary impact.</p>
                        <p>The established practice is that countries, especially the more developed
                            countries, receiving quota increases in the Fund should increase their
                            subscription to the capital of the World Bank by a corresponding amount.
                            We believe this tradition should be maintained, in the light of our
                            desire to strengthen multilateral lending institutions. This will
                            require authorizing legislation and have a budget impact of $24.6
                            million in Fiscal 1971, corresponding to a 10 percent paid in portion of
                            a $246.1 million capital subscription. Allowance has been made for this
                            in your prospective 1971 budget.</p>
                        <p>With your approval, I plan to vote the United States in favor of the
                            proposed increase in <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> quotas and to

                        <p>The gold communique of March 17, 1968, established the two-tier gold
                            market where monetary gold would be exchanged among official authorities
                            at the official price and the free market would determine the price for
                            all other uses. Monetary authorities would no longer buy gold from the
                            private market, including new production. See <ref

                                >IMF</gloss> eschewed purchases of gold from South Africa but,
                            according to a July 30, 1969, memorandum from T. Page Nelson, Director
                            of the Office of International Gold and Foreign Exchange Operations, to

                            effort to sell gold to monetary authorities and concluded the amount

                        <p>During 1969 there was an active exchange of cables between Washington and
                            the Embassy in Kinshasa with instructions for the Embassy to protest
                            Congolese purchases of South African gold with Congo’s Central Bank
                            Governor Ndele and, on at least one occasion, President Mobutu. This
                            exchange of cables and related memoranda are in the National Archives,

                            outgoing messages were drafted in the Treasury Department and forwarded
                            to the State Department for clearance and transmission; others were
                            drafted in State and cleared with Treasury.</p>
                        <p>Early in the exchange Washington agencies noted, for Ndele’s information,
                            that the purchase by the Congo Central Bank was in violation of the U.S.
                            understanding of Congo’s intentions and was upsetting the international
                            monetary system. In addition, Congolese gold purchases might cause
                            problems elsewhere in the bilateral relationship as <pb n="390"

                            a less-developed country holding its reserves in a non-earning asset,
                            had sometimes considered amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act
                            prohibiting aid to countries buying monetary gold. Since Congo had
                            purchased the South African gold at $35 per ounce and the free market
                            was then at $42, the Embassy was instructed to request that Ndele resell
                            that gold in the free market, reap the profit, and be in conformity with
                            the communique. (Telegram 17644 to Kinshasa, February 4, 1969; ibid., FN
                            19)</p>
                        <p>In their rebuttal to Ndele’s negative response to the Embassy’s initial
                            demarche, Washington agencies explained on February 19, in telegram
                            26264 to Kinshasa, that the position on purchase of newly-mined gold was
                            not specifically spelled out in the March 17, 1968, communique because
                            Canada and Switzerland had been unclear about their legal authority to
                            refuse to purchase. Shortly after the two-tier system was established,
                            however, four of the largest gold-producing countries after South Africa
                            (Canada, the United States, Australia, and Japan) took steps to have
                            their new production go into the free market and not into monetary
                            reserves. Washington agencies pointed out that the signatories
                            recognized that the two-tier system could not operate effectively if the
                            world’s largest gold producer could channel its output to either market
                            depending on which would give it the greatest benefit. In support of
                            that point they quoted from an August 1968 speech, which was not further
                            identified, by Bundesbank Director <persName corresp="#p_EO1">Otmar

                                    If this privilege were granted to South Africa it could decide

                                    sales of gold on the free market in an erratic way, to keep the
                                    gold market in a state of constant unrest and thus make the gold

                            governments were applying to U.S. gold reserves. Regarding the U.S.
                            suggestion that Congo sell on the open market gold already purchased
                            from South Africa and then purchase an equal amount from the United

                            the South Africans. Going back on his word, even to South Africans,
                            would blot his personal integrity in international banking circles.
                            Nonetheless Ndele said that he had no special interest in South Africa
                            and would much prefer dealing with friends as long as he could be
                            assured of having future gold needs met under the same conditions.

                            that gold was 40 percent of Congolese reserves, Ndele ended the
                            discussion saying at that point he had no intention of purchasing more
                            gold. (Telegram 170804 to Kinshasa, October 8; ibid., FN 17)</p>

                            declined, causing concern in some official circles that it might fall

                            <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> met with South African
                            officials in Rome on December 13-14, and the agreement they reached was
                            ratified by the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> on December 30. In
                            effect, whenever the gold price was above $35, South Africa would market
                            gold on the free market in amounts needed to meet its need for foreign
                            exchange, and any additional production would be added to South African
                            reserves. When the price was at $35 or below, South Africa would market
                            newly-mined gold to the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> at $35 to
                            meet its foreign exchange needs, and if new production was less than
                            adequate to meet current foreign exchange requirements, South Africa
                            would be permitted to sell the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> gold

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> suggested that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> should lead off on
                            this topic.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said that in the first
                            quarter of 1970 our official settlements deficit was about $3 billion.
                            This resulted partly from a reversal of year-end window dressing by U.S.
                            corporations to meet the direct investment control requirements. About
                            one-third of the deficit was accounted for by a reduction of U.S. bank
                            borrowing from overseas branches. The liquidity deficit in the first
                            quarter was around $2 billion. It also was influenced by the window
                            dressing operations. A better picture is given by averaging the fourth
                            and first quarters. This gives an official settlements deficit of just
                            over $1 billion per quarter and a liquidity deficit of several hundred
                            million dollars.</p>
                        <p>In other words, we got what we had anticipated. With the downward
                            movement of U.S. interest rates, there was a reversal of capital flows.
                            This would continue if there were to be a continued downward movement in
                            our rates. However, with the recent rise in U.S. interest rates there
                            has been no further drop of U.S. bank borrowings from overseas branches.
                            In fact, there has been some increase. The slowdown in the U.S. economy
                            has had the natural result of improving our trade balance. The trade
                            surplus for the first quarter was about $500 million, or an annual rate
                            of $2 billion. Repayment of foreign bank loans also helped our situation
                            in this period.</p>
                        <p>Looking further ahead, we want to see an increase in our trade balance
                            over the next several years, so as to restore the level of the
                            mid-1960’s. This together with gains on remittances of profits should
                            lead to an improvement of the current account. While the capital
                            accounts have been abnormally favorable in the recent past, we would not
                            expect them to be so adverse as they were in the early 1960’s. The
                            development of foreign capital markets means that there should be less
                            reliance on the American market. The narrowing of the interest rate
                            spread between the U.S. and the rest of the world works in the same
                            direction. We do, however, expect a chronic deficit on the capital and
                            aid accounts.</p>
                        <p>In summary, our long-term outlook is for a stronger trade position and
                            current account, with some capital outflow but less than in the early
                            1960’s. We have no illusion that this objective can be achieved this
                            year or next. We will continue to have an underlying deficit, and the
                            question is whether or not it will be aggravated by abnormal outflows of
                            short-term money.</p>
                        <p>Our basic accounts are showing an improvement. Whether or not this will
                            continue depends upon what happens abroad. All of the major countries
                            except Canada want to run current account surpluses. Even Canada wants
                            to move from deficit to equilibrium. Japan, the other <pb n="394"
                                xml:id="pg_394" facs="0422"/>country which affects us most, is
                            moving from equilibrium to a large surplus. European countries are also
                            seeking to strengthen their position.</p>
                        <p>The fundamental question is whether or not we can restore our traditional
                            competitive position by better price policies than elsewhere. In 1959
                            our trade position was similar to the present situation. Some five years
                            later we have built our trade surplus back up to $6.5 billion. However,
                            that was a period of underemployment of U.S. resources, and the
                            prospects are admittedly less favorable today.</p>
                        <p>We do not want to restore our trade position through the use of import
                            restrictions, and the President is determined to resist pressures in the
                            U.S. for such restrictions. We are concentrating on two areas to help
                            improve our trade balance: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>In the field of export credit, we have traditionally placed
                                    great reliance on the fact that our interest rates were lower
                                    than those prevailing elsewhere. With the present high rates in
                                    the United States this advantage has been lost. We are therefore
                                    providing more budget money to the Export-Import Bank, which is
                                    also undertaking to liberalize its lending policies.</item>

                                <item>During his visit to Paris last December, Secretary <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> mentioned our concern
                                    about the effect on our export position, stemming from the
                                    differences between the U.S. tax system and foreign tax systems.
                                    At that time we indicated that we were studying the possibility
                                    of providing the same facility for exports as we give to a U.S.
                                    subsidiary manufacturing abroad. This means taxing the profits
                                    only when they are remitted to the parent company. We have now
                                    developed a concrete proposal in this regard, and we hope it
                                    will help shift the focus of our producers somewhat from the
                                    domestic to the export market. This is a chronic problem for us.
                                    U.S. producers have tended to look upon the export market as
                                    marginal, whereas in many European countries it is the market
                                    towards which producers make their major effort. The proposed
                                    measure is designed to bring about a change in U.S. business
                                    psychology, and in the short run this will certainly be as
                                    important as any real results.</item>

                        <p>Our very heavy military expenditures abroad are also an important element
                            in our balance of payments outlook. They have tended to increase in
                            recent years because of rising costs and the Vietnam effort. Even if we
                            succeed in disengaging ourselves from Vietnam, there will still be
                            outlays of about $1.5 billion a year in Europe, mostly in Germany. It
                            would be our hope to get some better offset to that than we have had in
                            the past.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> said he had had
                            talks on these matters with a number of countries. Take the case of
                            Japan. They have become a world economic power, but their people have
                            not yet grasped the implications of the change in their position.
                            Whereas before, our trade with Japan was in equilibrium or even in
                            surplus, it has now moved into deficit. <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395"
                                facs="0423"/>There are a number of problem areas. In the field of
                            electronics, they have taken the entire U.S. market for radios and most
                            of the market for black and white T.V. sets. They are even moving into
                            the colored T.V. market. We find that their producers follow different
                            pricing policies as regards the domestic and export markets. We have
                            emphasized to them the difficulties of resisting pressures in the U.S.
                            for quantitative restrictions in the face of such practices.</p>
                        <p>The point is that a country can’t have closed markets at home and expect
                            to enjoy open markets elsewhere. Capital and equity markets should be
                            open. Similar considerations apply in the case of development aid. With
                            respect to the Asian Development Bank, we are keeping our share equal to
                            that of Japan rather than taking the lion’s share.</p>
                        <p>Then look at the question of defense expenditures. Japan has virtually no
                            defense budget. Likewise defense expenditures in Europe are much smaller
                            proportionately than those of the U.S. We are working on this matter in
                            NATO, but it is an uphill struggle. It is always difficult to bring
                            about a shift, when that means budget increases for others.</p>
                        <p>In the matter of trade, as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1"
                                >Volcker</persName> said, U.S. producers are oriented towards the
                            domestic market. Their approach to foreign markets has been to put
                            plants abroad instead of direct selling of U.S. products. We have done
                            quite of bit of work during the past year to find some tax techniques
                            which would encourage a shift in attitudes. However, this is not much of
                            an answer if other countries do better at controlling inflation than the
                            U.S. We recognize that success on this front is fundamental.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, it is simply not possible for all countries to realize
                            surpluses simultaneously. If all industrial countries are in surplus, it
                            would simply have to come out of the hide of the developing
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> asked
                            whether or not the U.S. authorities regarded the level of U.S. prices as
                            being competitive.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> said the
                            situation varied from product to product. Our prices certainly are
                            competitive in the case of sophisticated products and primary products.
                            We were less competitive in many other lines. Agriculture gives us great
                            concern, for as the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> moves to the
                                <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss>, high prices in Europe affect
                            our agricultural exports. If the U.K. enters the Common Market, there
                            would be a big problem for us were we to lose the British market for
                            agricultural commodities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said our agricultural
                            exports were down slightly over the past five years. Japan is a good
                            example. They have insisted on achieving self-sufficiency in rice, even
                            though their price is about double the world price. In other commodity
                            areas our exports have held up well. The root of our trade account
                            problem has been the growth of imports.</p>
                        <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0424"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> said the
                            American people seem to think that the U.S. trade problem is with the
                            Common Market. The figures show the contrary, however. Between 1958 and
                            1969 U.S. exports increased by 118 percent to the rest of the world, 145
                            percent to <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>, and 182 percent to the
                                <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> said he was sure
                            that this attitude was not prevalent in U.S. official circles. He had
                            already cited Canada and Japan as major problem areas for us in the
                            trade field. Of course, there were a few dramatic cases which had had a
                            considerable influence on public attitudes. For example, when our
                            poultry exporters were shut out of the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>
                            market, this got considerable publicity and certainly was an irritant.
                            However, we always supported a strong community with the idea that there
                            would be an increase in demand in which all would share. This definitely
                            remains our policy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> pointed out that in
                            recent years trade in general had shown substantial increases. This
                            particularly was the case as regards U.S. imports, including U.S.
                            imports from the Common Market.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> said that
                            was the result of what had been happening in the U.S. and could scarcely
                            be blamed upon the Common Market.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Larre</persName> asked if we had in mind a
                            target surplus for our current account.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said we did not, but
                            we certainly hoped that it would grow.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR1">Petty</persName> said that it would, of
                            course, not be one percent of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> as in
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Plescoff</persName> said he presumed we would be happy with
                            one-half percent of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said that was true for
                            the moment, but he not sure it would be enough over the longer run.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Larre</persName> asked what were our
                            estimates of the current account for 1970.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said we were
                            projecting a trade surplus of $2 billion or $2.5 billion and a surplus
                            on goods and services of $3 billion. This would leave us with a current
                            account surplus of $1.5 or $1.6 billion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR1">Petty</persName> said, with respect to
                            the Minister’s question, that studies showed demand for our exports to
                            be relatively inelastic. Secondly, U.S. opinion certainly does not
                            attribute all of our problems to the Common Market. It is recognized
                            that part of the difficulty stems from our inflation and from the
                            Japanese problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said that over the
                            last five years there had been a substantial deterioration of the U.S.
                            trade position with Japan, Canada, <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397"
                                facs="0425"/>Germany and Italy. With other countries the total had
                            been steady, and there had been some gains.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLBK1">MacLaury</persName> said that this
                            pattern did not suggest that the dollar was overvalued.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR1">Petty</persName> said that the problem
                            with Japan arose from the restrictions which they maintained against
                            outsiders and that in the case of Canada the automobile agreement had an
                            asymmetrical effect, because U.S. cars imported into Canada were still
                            subject to a 15 percent tariff.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> said there was a
                            feeling of concern in Congress, which he shared, about the effect on
                            trade of the differences between the U.S. and European tax systems. We
                            have been studying what we might do in this regard, but it is hard to
                            make a change in our system, which relies heavily on income taxes. Some
                            people have suggested that we ought to introduce a value-added tax and
                            some people think that we should adopt border taxes. However, we have
                            not taken any decisions on these matters. So far the only proposal to be
                            adopted is the <gloss target="#t_DISC1">DISC</gloss> proposal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> said the
                            value-added tax had considerable merits as a substitute for an ordinary
                            sales tax. However, it was complicated and lent itself to fraud.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> expressed
                            surprise at the Minister’s statement. He said that one of the arguments
                            put forward by U.S. proponents of the tax was that it was difficult to
                            evade.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> said that
                            was true for large industrial corporations but not in a number of other
                            areas. He then referred to the situation of several years ago when the
                            U.S. authorities repeatedly predicted that the deficit would be over in
                            a year or so. At that time the problem was expressed in terms of much
                            narrower margins. Now, however, the figures we hear are much higher, $5
                            billion or $10 billion. And in point of fact the U.S. had a surplus last
                            year. Is there any way in which the problem could be put that would make
                            it more understandable?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said the question
                            raised by the Minister was a complicated and difficult one. There is no
                            easy answer. It is true we had a surplus last year and the year before,
                            but that surplus was unsatisfactory. It resulted from inflows of
                            short-term money. It was interesting to see the problems which that
                            surplus created for the rest of the world. The result was that we drew
                            reserves from the rest of the world, and there were many complaints in
                            WP-3 that our surplus was too large.</p>
                        <p>How should the U.S. basic position be measured? It is not easy to say. We
                            should think in terms of a current account surplus, but we cannot say
                            exactly how large this surplus should be beyond saying several billion
                            dollars more than in the past. We had an overall surplus in 1968, but in
                            fact our basic accounts were deteriorating. Last year we held our <pb
                                n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0426"/>own, and this year we will show
                            some improvement. Over a period of years official dollar holdings should
                            not be increasing, and this will be a valid position if we create enough
                            liquidity in other forms. Neither the liquidity nor the official
                            settlements basis provides a figure that is understandable to the
                            general public. We need to do much more work on this matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> said it was
                            important for the world to know where the U.S. was going. He hoped the
                            U.S. authorities could find a meaningful balance of payments
                            presentation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said he thought
                            attention should be focused on the current account. However, with a
                            current account presentation it was important to keep in mind that
                            equilibrium was not zero but a big positive number.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> said that we
                            would have to spend a lot more time on this question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> said he
                            would like to make a few remarks about the French balance of payments
                            outlook. The trade account now shows a small surplus. This state of
                            affairs will probably continue for several months but change later in
                            the year. The swing to exports since the devaluation seems to have been
                            abnormally high, and it would be reasonable to expect some downward
                            correction. Other items will probably be about in balance for 1970. The
                            present French projection is for an overall surplus of about $1 billion,
                            or perhaps a little more, in 1970. However, if the present rate of
                            foreign exchange inflows continues, the figure could turn out to be much
                            higher.</p>
                        <p>For the next five years, the target is to keep a small trade surplus and
                            to cut the deficit in services, mainly by improving the insurance and
                            shipping accounts. The result would be a surplus of $500 million to $700
                            million per year in order to permit the outward flow of French
                            investments. As Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName>
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> remarked, France,
                            like all other countries, is looking for a surplus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said that with the
                            devaluation of the French franc and the revaluation of the Deutschemark,
                            financial opinion seems to feel that France has restored a strong
                            competitive position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> said that
                            French exporters generally agree with this assessment. In his talks with
                            them, for virtually the first time, he hears no complaints about their
                            competitive position.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> referred to the
                            work which the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> has been doing on the
                            question of limited exchange flexibility. He commented that the
                            techniques under consideration would involve no wide changes in the
                            present exchange rate system. One matter which would <pb n="399"
                                xml:id="pg_399" facs="0427"/>have to be decided was whether these
                            techniques could and should be put into effect without an amendment of
                            the present Articles, or whether such an amendment was necessary or
                            desirable. He asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>
                            to present the U.S. view of the matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> recalled that the
                            proposals under consideration involved widening exchange margins
                            somewhat, the possibility of small and frequent changes in exchange
                            parities, and facilitating transitional floating rates for countries
                            moving to a new parity. A fourth possibility, some method of formal Fund
                            approval for the so-called “trotting” rate systems, had found no support
                            outside of the countries resorting to such techniques. In the <gloss
                                target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> Deputies Meeting in Paris last month
                            there seemed to be fairly wide agreement that the first three
                            possibilities might be permitted on the basis of the present Articles.
                            The question is whether there should be an amendment to permit them more
                            explicitly. Another point is whether or not the Fund can develop
                            criteria for determining when small and frequent changes in parity might
                            be appropriate. This is not something which can be solved quickly, but
                            in the U.S. view it deserves further study.</p>
                        <p>It is important to recognize that we are not talking about freely
                            floating rates or highly automatic systems. The initiative for rate
                            changes would remain with the countries concerned, subject, of course,
                            to Fund approval. Alternatively, the Fund might give a country a general
                            authorization to move its parity within a limited range. Thus the
                            proposals do not involve any change in fundamentals but they do involve
                            a change in attitudes. The idea would be to try to develop a less rigid
                            attitude toward exchange rate changes. Of course, no one can tell how
                            much these proposals would be used if they were adopted. If they were
                            not used very much, the result would be not much change in the system.
                            The change would be greater if more use were made of them. In any case,
                            it seems to us that there would be a net gain if the matter of exchange
                            rate adjustments could be made less political.</p>
                        <p>The timetable calls for a report by the Fund in July or early August,
                            which would spell out the three proposals for which there is support and
                            make clear that the fourth is excluded. This would be a chance to state
                            conclusions on limited flexibility modestly but positively. Then it
                            would have to be decided whether the proposals would be given effect
                            through amendment of the Articles or through a decision by the Executive
                            Board to provide guidance for member countries on limited parity
                            changes. The matter of amendment is in the first instance one of
                            symbolic importance, but if it led to greater use of the facilities, it
                            could have substantive implications for the future.</p>
                        <p>Another meeting of the Deputies is scheduled for early July. This would
                            give them a chance to take up any hard core questions on the <pb n="400"
                                xml:id="pg_400" facs="0428"/>matter, so that the <gloss

                            would be the subject of a <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss>
                            Ministerial Meeting in Brussels on Saturday, September 19. Then the
                            Ministers would be in a position to voice their opinions on the question
                            at the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Meeting in Copenhagen the
                            following week. Presumably the major issue in Brussels would be whether
                            to undertake an amendment of the Articles or not.</p>

                                <item>It is not clear whether widening exchange margins would
                                    discourage or encourage speculation. Both official and academic
                                    opinion are about evenly divided. The <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                        >EC</gloss> has a special interest in this particular
                                    matter. The Six have the feeling that if they could reach a
                                    certain degree of monetary union, their currencies might
                                    fluctuate as a bloc against the dollar. In the interim they fear
                                    that a facility for widening exchange margins could work havoc
                                    with the <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss> and with their
                                    efforts towards economic union. They realize that the facility

                                    some countries might seek to make use of the facility to gain an

                                    the proposal for small and frequent changes in parity. For years
                                    the Fund pressed the U.K., Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, and
                                    others, on the matter of exchange rates. The Articles did not
                                    prevent changes from being made. The real obstacle was internal
                                    political problems in the countries in question. In the French
                                    view there would be no harm in saying that there can be small

                                    would be encouraged, provided they were kept within certain
                                    limits and did not upset the general exchange rate

                            intra-Community margins within the framework of the present system. If
                            they solved the technical problems, which are admittedly difficult, it
                            would appear that they could also do so if there were a facility for
                            widening margins generally.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Larre</persName> said that the technical
                            problem could be handled. But there is also an economic problem: What
                            will be the level of the six currencies in relation to the rest of the
                            world? With harder and softer currencies within the Six, the level
                            chosen will inevitably place strain on some of those currencies as
                            against others. Such strain would not be welcome to the <gloss

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> said that
                            obviously when countries decide to achieve common monetary policies,
                            they accept the political consequences. However, if there is a widening
                            of margins in the rest of the world and if the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss> maintains margins or narrows them within the Six, and if
                            there is only a halfhearted monetary union, there will be difficulties.
                            It does not seem likely that there will be a common monetary policy very
                            soon. This is mainly due to the troubles in Italy. There is also the
                            matter of the U.K. They have said that they are ready to take a view
                            similar to that of the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> and not open
                            the margins. Thus the technical and political aspects are mixed
                            together.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said it was clear that
                            the proposal for wider margins was not of much interest if neither the
                            Common Market nor the U.K. wanted to make use of it. That left
                            nobody.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> said it

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said the U.S. in
                            effect maintained no margins. Our exchange rate is the result of what
                            the others do. With the U.K., the Common Market, and Japan out of the
                            wider margin proposal there was no important country left.</p>
                        <p>However, the proposal took on greater interest in combination with the
                            proposal for small and frequent parity changes. That proposal also
                            appears to create difficulties for the Common Market. However, if there
                            are no common policies for a number of years or for as long as a decade,
                            it must be assumed that there will be parity changes. With the high
                            degree of discipline they will have, the Six may be one group that would
                            be able to make a crawling peg system work fairly well, but there is a
                            philosophical problem. The crawling peg seems to run in the opposite
                            sense to the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> objective of fixed
                            parities. It does not offer the same incentive to harmonization of
                            policies. It is hard to see how this philosophical problem can be
                            solved.</p>

                            two recent rate changes within the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> had
                            greatly disturbed the Common Market. Admittedly, the disturbance might
                            have been less if the magnitude of the changes had been smaller.</p>
                        <p>Over the next five or ten years the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>
                            will be moving towards fixed parities, and this will take the monetary
                            variable out of the system. It is true that with no coordinated
                            policies, as now is the case, events could force a substantial parity
                            change. The remaining problem is Italy, and that is almost purely a
                            political problem. Who could forecast the Italian outlook for the next
                            ten years? For the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> members, a change
                            of 2 or 3 percent per year does not seem a very valuable tool. The
                            normal aim of economic policy is to accommodate adjustments of 2 or 3
                            percent a year. For trade and the common farm prices it is much easier
                            to have a fixed parity. Therefore, the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>
                            has to keep open the possibility that there may <pb n="402"
                                xml:id="pg_402" facs="0430"/>be one major rate adjustment, but they
                            have no interest in small parity changes. This was the view expressed at
                            the last <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> Finance Ministers Meeting in
                            Paris.</p>
                        <p>As for the rest of the world, exchange rate changes have been delayed too
                            long in the past with bad results. However, France does not want a
                            system where currencies move against one immovable currency: the dollar.
                            In the recent Deputies Meeting this was the U.S. thesis, and it is just
                            not acceptable to France. The French authorities recognize that it is
                            often difficult to determine whether an imbalance is the responsibility
                            of the deficit or the surplus country. However, if as in 1968 the
                            imbalance is clearly due to the U.S., France would not accept that the
                            deficit situation be dealt with by moving currencies against the
                            dollar.</p>
                        <p>France does not want its exchange rate always being corrected to keep
                            French products in an under-competitive position. If they have an
                            abnormally large surplus because they had followed policies that were
                            too deflationary, of course it would be up to them to revalue. But if
                            their policies and payments position are normal, and if the imbalance is
                            created by inflationary demand in the U.S., it would be unfair to expect
                            France to cut its surplus by revaluation.</p>
                        <p>The French authorities want to know whether the U.S. stands by the basic
                            principle that it is up to the country where the imbalance arises to
                            adjust, either through its fiscal and monetary policies or through an
                            exchange rate change. If this principle is accepted, then we can study
                            ways in which the change might be facilitated—for example, the
                            transitional floating rate. However, this does not seem to be Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>’s point of view. His
                            ideas are very plausible, but France will not accept the proposition
                            that in a system with only one reserve currency all parities have to be
                            corrected to make the system function.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> asked how, with
                            such a position, there would be a revaluation. Why with their good
                            record would the Germans ever revalue? In such a world there could only
                            be devaluations by countries said to be causing the imbalances. Why
                            should countries ever revalue?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Larre</persName> said the reason would be
                            to protect themselves, not to relieve others of the necessity to
                            devalue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> said he
                            recognized it was difficult to say where the responsibility for
                            imbalances lay. However, during the last 18 months the growth of
                            European exports had been due more to the U.S. inflation than to the
                            economic position of the European countries. In such a case it was clear
                            where the responsibility lay. Or take the French situation. If there
                            were reserve gains due to hot money, France would look like a surplus
                            country and would have to revalue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said that was not
                            correct. Whether or not to revalue would be a decision for France. If
                            the reserve gains resulted from <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0431"
                            />inflows of hot money there would be no reason to revalue. On the other
                            hand, the French authorities might want to revalue if the French
                            competitive position was strengthening and the rise of exports was
                            creating a danger of inflation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Larre</persName> said that a rate change
                            of this kind would be acceptable under the present Articles.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> asked what
                            was new in the limited flexibility proposals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said that the present
                            Fund Articles specified that a rate change could be made only to correct
                            a fundamental disequilibrium. A change of one or two percent a year
                            could not be called a fundamental disequilibrium. Take the German case.
                            They expect to achieve a better price performance over time than other
                            countries. In that situation it would be better not to let the gap
                            accumulate. It would be better to make changes of one or two percent a
                            year. Such a change could be made in the first year, and then if the
                            price performance was not so good in the following year, the rate could
                            be held. This could be a desirable option for some countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> referred to
                            the argument that the proposal for small and frequent parity changes
                            would discourage speculation. It seemed to him that, on the contrary,
                            the speculators would come to expect small and frequent changes, and
                            speculation would thus be encouraged. At the last <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> meeting the French delegation said
                            there could be a study of wider margins, but they are reluctant, for
                            general philosophical reasons, about the proposal for small and frequent
                            parity charges.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said that was why the
                            two proposals were in a single package. The wider margins would tend to
                            offset any encouragement given to speculation by the technique of small
                            and frequent parity changes. Governor Wormser said that in his view the
                            present Articles gave latitude to put into effect all the proposals. He
                            also felt an amendment would have to be symmetrical to allow for
                            revaluation as well as devaluation. However, the U.S. seems to be
                            shifting the emphasis. The principle laid down at Bretton Woods was that
                            fixed parities should be defended to the end. The idea was that the
                            national economy and the level of prices should be adapted to fixed
                            parities through the adjustment process. Such a process will always be
                            painful.</p>
                        <p>An amendment on limited flexibility would lead countries to give up the
                            adjustment process. It would offer them another way out of their
                            difficulties. Henceforth they could adjust parities to their prices.
                            This would be a very serious change. It would destroy the forces against
                            a permanent system of devaluation. When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1"
                                >Giscard d’Estaing</persName> devalued <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404"
                                facs="0432"/>the franc in 1969, he also put into effect stringent
                            adjustment policies. What would be the behavior of a Finance Minister
                            ten years hence where parity changes had become the habit? These
                            proposals for limited flexibility are very dangerous ground.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> said the
                            discussion had been very helpful. It was the clearest exposition he had
                            heard of the doubts about the limited flexibility proposals. The French
                            authorities had some reservations on the matter of amendment, and not a
                            closed mind to the idea of small and frequent parity changes. Perhaps
                            this would do it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said that on the
                            matter of symmetry the U.S. certainly agreed that the limited
                            flexibility techniques should not be asymmetrical. On the other hand, we
                            had the feeling that the present system worked asymmetrically against
                            us. Countries that are forced to the wall do devalue. But a country with
                            a good performance rarely revalues. If this could be changed, it would
                            be a net gain to get rid of the devaluation bias against the dollar. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> asked why
                            an exception was made for the U.S. as regards the limited flexibility
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said that the U.S. can
                            change the price of gold but it cannot change its exchange rate. That
                            can only be done through the decision of others.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> asked why
                            there could not be small and frequent changes in the price of gold.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR1">Petty</persName> referred to the
                            possibility that the U.S. economic performance might be better than
                            other countries. He asked whether in this hypothesis the Minister would
                            be willing to see the dollar price of gold crawl downward.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> said he did
                            not see why not.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said we should be
                            careful not to confuse the question of gold price and the question of
                            exchange rates.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Larre</persName> said that technically the
                            devaluation of the franc last August was a change in the franc price of
                            gold.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said that if other
                            countries had followed France by increasing the price of gold in their
                            currencies, France would have had to devalue all over again.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Larre</persName> said that if the U.S.
                            felt the problem of the dollar was a matter for discussion in the <gloss
                                target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss>, that would be all right with France.
                            However, he presumed that U.S. did not want such a discussion.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> said that a
                            change in the price of gold would require Congressional action. There
                            was absolutely no doubt on that score. If the objective was to upset
                            markets this would certainly be an effective way to do it, for
                            Congressional action would require considerable time. Indeed, a proposal
                            for a major change in the gold price could <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405"
                                facs="0433"/>well lead Congress to impeach the President. This was
                            less an economic than psychological and emotional matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> said that
                            if these limited improvements are intended to make for easier rate
                            changes and if there is no need for amendment of the Articles, that
                            could be a matter of practical discussion. But the U.S. presentation
                            evokes another atmosphere. It seems to involve a fundamental change from
                            Bretton Woods. If there is an intention to depart from support of the
                            adjustment process, it ought to be presented as such.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said these proposals
                            were not regarded as a great solution for the U.S. competitive position.
                            We couldn’t stand repeated revaluations against the dollar. The
                            proposals would be helpful to us directly if they squeezed out the
                            devaluation bias in the present system, but they stand or fall on
                            whether they could help the system as a whole in terms of speculation
                            and in terms of the adjustment process.</p>

                            proposal for using <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s to provide
                            financing for economic development. Our view has been that it is
                            premature to consider such a link. We have felt that it was better first
                            to get <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s established as a new
                            supplement to international reserves. Therefore, we have taken the
                            position that there should be no action now on the link proposal and
                            perhaps not even in the future.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said that we are
                            committed to the idea of amending the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> Articles at some future date to permit the use of
                                <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s as well as gold in payment of
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> quota subscriptions. For us the
                            question was one of timing.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> said that
                            Congressman Reuss has been pushing us very hard on this question. At the
                            time of the <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> legislation he wanted to
                            introduce a provision that would have required us to take <gloss
                                target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s instead of gold.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said that he thought
                            there was a consensus for such an amendment and that it ought to be done
                            at some convenient time prior to the next increase in Fund quotas. This
                            change would make it possible to avoid gold payments to the Fund and the
                            problem of mitigation.</p>
                        <p>On the matter of the <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> link to
                            development financing, the proposal has been that this should be studied
                            in an appropriate international forum. We are reluctant to get into such
                            a discussion with a large group of developing countries at this time for
                            fear of where it might lead. However, when this matter comes up in
                            international meetings, we have sometimes felt that we were the only
                            country resisting the idea of a study. If the French authorities agree
                            with our position, we hope they will instruct their delegations to
                            support us.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LR1">Larre</persName> said the French feel they
                            have a good control over their delegations. The U.S. may be sure that it
                            is not alone in opposing discussion. As a matter of fact, their
                            delegations have sometimes reported to them the fear that the U.S.
                            delegation would be the one to give ground on this point.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> said he had
                            talked recently with Mr. <persName>McNamara</persName>, who may also
                            have talked to the Minister. He would like to ask Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJR1">Petty</persName> to make a few comments on where
                            the problem stood.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR1">Petty</persName> said that at the recent
                            meeting in Vienna Mr. <persName>de Larosiere</persName> had made an
                            excellent presentation of the special problems confronting France
                            because of its large aid program as a percentage of <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> and because of the difference between
                            its share in <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> and its voting rights
                            in the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>. However, it would be
                            difficult to achieve a $1 billion replenishment if the final French
                            position were limited to an annual French budgetary expenditure of $40
                            billion. Perhaps the way out of the difficulty would be for France to
                            take a selective increase in its <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>
                            capital subscription and for the increase in its <gloss target="#t_IDA1"
                                >IDA</gloss> contribution to be limited to 90 or 100 percent
                            compared to the increase of 150 percent which other countries are
                            accepting. Such an increase for France would greatly help us to reach
                            the replenishment target. A $1 billion replenishment would mean more
                                <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> money for the franc area
                            countries, and this would rebound to the benefit of France.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> said that
                            another possibility would be to do something on the timing of the French
                            payments. They would not necessarily have to be the same amount each
                            year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> said the
                            matter of <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> replenishment was
                            discussed at the last meeting of the Common Market Finance Ministers.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> proposed that the Six
                            support a level of $500 million, and the others decided to accept his
                            proposal. Subsequently, the French had heard at Vienna that the Germans
                            had moved to support a higher figure. The Ministers will meet again at
                            the end of the month. If this report about the change in the German
                            position is confirmed, the Ministers from the other <gloss
                                target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> countries will have to decide what
                            position they should take.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR1">Petty</persName> said that Italy had now
                            indicated support for the $1 billion figure, and the Netherlands had
                            confirmed their support of that level of replenishment. The Belgians had
                            not yet taken a decision. The Japanese said they could support $1
                            billion if all Part I countries did. We pointed out to the Japanese that
                            the French had a unique position, and they said they recognized this.
                            Therefore, the outcome turns on what the French and the Germans do.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName> said we could
                            not settle the matter today. However, we were getting close to an
                            agreement. The U.S. has supported the $1 billion figure because of our
                            feeling that it was important to have a large volume of aid through
                            multilateral channels. Our purpose in raising the question was to ask
                            the French to think about what they could do to help us reach a
                            satisfactory agreement.</p>

                        <p>On May 31, 1970, Canada floated the Canadian dollar, in large part
                            because of large capital inflows and concerns about inflationary
                            consequences. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">Kennedy</persName>
                            informed President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> of the

                            follow-up memorandum to the President informing him that exchange
                            markets were settled and the Canadian dollar was now trading about 5
                            percent above its previous par value. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Walker</persName> debunked suspicions that the United States may
                            have influenced the Canadians to float. (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>Foreign exchange markets were otherwise relatively quiet following the
                            major currency adjustments in 1969, and remained so until the spring of
                            1971. During this time U.S. policymakers’ concerns with international
                            monetary reform focused on limited exchange rate flexibility. In January
                            1970 the Department of State sent an airgram to the Embassies and
                            Consulates in major financial centers and industrial countries, as well
                            as the Missions to the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> and the
                            European Community, informing them the United States fully supported
                            discussion of limited exchange rate flexibility in the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. The addressees were cautioned,
                            however, that the United States had no fixed views on what the outcome
                            of the discussions should be and was not seeking systematically to
                            initiate bilateral discussions at that time. The airgram then provided
                            extensive background material addressees could use sparingly to
                            underscore U.S. interest in the subject, but requested that specific
                            issues or technical points raised by host country officials be referred
                            to Washington for reply. (CA-279, January 16, 1970; National Archives,

                        <p>On February 25 U.S. Executive Director Dale made a statement in the
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Board setting out five areas in
                            which the United States thought efforts should be concentrated: somewhat
                            wider bands, flexible authority to depart from generally applicable
                            rules of the game, the concept of fundamental disequilibrium, upward and
                            downward bias in the system, and presumptive criteria for changes in
                            exchange rates. <persName corresp="#p_DWB1">Dale</persName> said he
                            entered the discussions “with the view that rate changes should not be
                            the only—and perhaps seldom the primary—element of the adjustment
                            process, but that governments should consider exchange rate adjustment
                            in appropriate circumstances as an entirely respectable and useful
                            policy measure.” Dale then elaborated on each of the five areas, without
                            taking a position, and concluded by saying that the United States
                            expected to benefit from the views of other Fund members. The full text
                            of Dale’s statement was sent to the Embassies in <gloss target="#t_G101"

                            23 to discuss limited exchange rate flexibility. The opening paragraph
                            of a summary of the meeting read: “The general consensus was that this
                            one-day meeting had given a significant new impetus to the international
                            discussion of limited exchange flexibility. Though there continue to be
                            negative and cautious views within the Group of Ten, positive views were
                            expressed by important members (Germany, U.S., Italy). General agreement
                            was reached to pursue the subject further in the Deputies and to bring
                            it before the Ministers of the Group of Ten on September 19 in Brussels,
                            prior to the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Annual Meeting.”

                            towards exchange rate adjustment …. Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> favored a wider band of an
                            approximately 2 percent margin for countries that wish to use it. This
                            was not essential but would be helpful as an adjunct to small and
                            frequent parity changes in the form of a discretionary crawling peg at
                            the rate of about 2 to 3 percent over a 12-month period…. The crawling
                            parity raises two important sub-points. First, can criteria be

                                process of improving the functioning of the international monetary
                                and exchange system. This has two aspects—(a) strengthening the
                                process of balance of payments adjustment by facilitating the ready
                                use of exchange rate changes in appropriate circumstances, and (b)
                                enabling the major countries to cope more effectively with mobile
                                capital movements and exchange speculation, through somewhat wider
                                margins and other changes to facilitate more timely parity changes
                                when necessary. These broad objectives should be as important to

                            <item>In recent years exchange rate policy has played a difficult and
                                frequently disturbing role in the process of balance of payments
                                adjustment. There has been a growing feeling among economists and
                                some officials that more prompt adjustment of exchange rates might
                                have been helpful, if the rigidity resulting from publicized
                                political commitments and Cabinet decisions could have been tempered
                                by the techniques of wider margins, or small adjustments, or
                                transitional floats. Such limited decisions might, for example, be
                                made by monetary <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0439"
                                />authorities rather than dramatically announced by heads of state.
                                There has, however, been as yet only limited official acceptance of
                                the arguments put forward by private economists for this point of
                                view. The Fund report is a first and useful step in giving formal
                                official consideration to these possibilities.</item>

                            <item>The second aspect is related to the first, but is less dependent
                                upon the element of prompt action. Here it is argued that the
                                techniques of limited exchange flexibility, and especially wider
                                margins and/or other techniques for changing parities can be
                                technically helpful in inhibiting disequilibrating movements of
                                relatively liquid funds, and in decreasing speculation by increasing
                                the risks associated with it.</item>

                            <item>The United States would not look to the techniques envisaged in

                                existed, these techniques may be useful in reducing this bias, and
                                hence would tend to be a favorable factor in our longer-term need to
                                adjust our balance of payments position. However, looked upon as an
                                active means of correcting our own position and a substitute for
                                other action, these techniques would have serious offsetting
                                disadvantages to the United States. Specifically, repeated use of
                                these techniques among other important industrialized countries in
                                the direction of appreciation against the dollar could easily create
                                a strong presumption of further changes adverse to the dollar,
                                eroding the dollar as a vehicle and reserve currency, sharply
                                curtailing our financing flexibility in a monetary regime in which
                                large financing capability would still be required, and possibly
                                fomenting renewed speculation in gold. Consequently, our approach
                                must stand on more general considerations than on any presumption
                                that these techniques—or any series of revaluations—provide an
                                acceptable means for escaping balance of payments constraints. [In
                                presenting the U.S. position, U.S. officials should counteract any
                                impression that these small changes are being encouraged by the
                                United States as a substitute for corrective measures on our

                                        approach over time. In a struggle over a specific amendment,
                                        the progress made toward a more fluid interpretation of a
                                        fundamental disequilibrium could be reversed, and tight
                                        interpretation of a limited amendment could produce
                                        retrogression rather than advance in world practices toward

                                    <persName>Ossola</persName>, Chairman of the Deputies. This is a

                                limited exchange flexibility. It is designed to get agreement of the
                                French and Belgians to support an <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                    >IMF</gloss> Amendment permitting all three types of limited
                                exchange flexibility, by bartering in return a commitment within the
                                    <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> to use not only wider margins
                                but also moving parities and transitional floats only when the
                                    <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> countries move together as a
                                unit, with decisions to move taken by some as yet unspecified
                                procedure within the Six. This approach may well prove unacceptable
                                to the French and Belgians, who, for example, could bargain to
                                restrict the Amendment to cover only wider margins.</item>

                            <item>To some extent, the motivation for pushing rapidly toward an
                                    <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> position may be related to the
                                degree of pressure the U.S. exerts for an Amendment. It can be
                                argued that the price being offered to the French is rather high. It
                                appears to embody commitments among the Six going well beyond the
                                present commitment not to use wider margins within the Six. That is,
                                the ability of an <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> country acting
                                alone to use a moving parity or a transitional float would
                                apparently be given up right now, instead of some years
                                hence.</item>

                            <item>The proposal also would include a move toward the establishment of
                                narrower margins among the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>
                                currencies than those applicable to the dollar. This would enforce
                                some adjustment of individual dollar intervention points to conform
                                to <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> limits, and open the way to an
                                EPU type of <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> credit system,
                                concerted intervention, and not far off, common reserve management
                                policies. The French apparently consider that this would help to
                                dethrone the dollar both as a reserve and vehicular currency. This
                                suggests that the U.S. needs to determine whether it is in its
                                interest to expedite this process, recognizing that this will
                                probably be the course of evolution over time within the <gloss

                                the present scope, and these questions will need to be looked into

                                <p>“My delegation welcomes the report by the Executive Directors on
                                    the role of exchange rates in the adjustment of international
                                    payments. We are glad to see that this subject has been examined
                                    in the executive board for the first time since Bretton Woods in
                                    a thoroughgoing way, and through a special report. This report
                                    puts the subject in proper perspective. During the past five
                                    years there has been some evidence of rigidity in the system,
                                    and delay in the use of exchange rates for adjustment purposes
                                    on occasion. A study of this sort was long overdue, and we must
                                    not take it up and then simply drop it. We must face up to this
                                    question.</p>

                            <item>The report is judicious and in no sense radical. It stresses the
                                preservation of the basic principles of exchange stability, so long
                                as they <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0445"/>correspond to
                                economic realities. The report is the kind of analysis we expect to
                                have clarify many of the issues with which we must deal. It rejects
                                extreme measures but does broaden the concept of the adaptability of
                                the par value system. It recognizes that the transitional float has
                                been and may be useful in minimizing economic disruption and helping
                                restrain domestic inflation in those cases where a change is
                                necessary.</item>

                            <item>As the report suggests, my delegation is prepared to suspend

                                under the Fund’s articles will prove adequate. In this connection, I
                                hope the Deputies will keep the subject under review as it is
                                examined by the Executive Directors and inform the Ministers and
                                Governors of their collective or individual views on the need for an
                                amendment during the ensuing year.</item>

                            <item>I think that we will all agree that the work of the Deputies has
                                been very useful. I hope they will continue to meet and to report to
                                us. It has been demonstrated that they can do so without giving the
                                appearance of crisis.</item>

                            <item>Members of my delegation have made it clear that the United States
                                does not look to the techniques examined in the report as a means of
                                bringing about major improvements in our own balance of payments or
                                those of other countries. We rather think of them as helping to
                                loosen tendencies towards excessive rigidity in the exchange
                                structure, and possibly leavening past tendencies for exchange
                                depreciation to be more frequent than appreciation. In a broader
                                sense, we believe these exchange techniques deserve our more careful
                                consideration to make us better prepared to deal with the strains
                                arising from international movements of funds. I believe that it is
                                most helpful to have any differences of view expressed.</item>

                                on autonomy of national monetary policies, and that outflow of
                                dollars into foreign reserves would no longer be offset as in
                                January-June 1970 by “mitigating influences” of repayment of
                                official reserve credits. Ministers and Governors commented at some

                                be used to avoid inflationary domestic policies as it has in past

                            <p>The relationship between the stock of total U.S. international
                                reserve assets and the stock of U.S. reserve liabilities is not
                                satisfactory, either for the United States or for the international
                                community. Except for 1968 and 1969—when this result was clearly
                                seen as a temporary aberration—the trend in this relationship has
                                not been satisfactory for a number of years. Both of these factors

                                satisfaction of the world’s “demand” for official reserve assets
                                from a source other than an official settlements deficit in the U.S.
                                external balance. That source of satisfaction is now available in

                                sustained U.S. official settlements surplus, so that both the

                                        States and the world should aim for a U.S. official
                                        settlements surplus in the range of $2-3 billion per year,

                                        later during the quinquennium should be judged importantly
                                        against this generally-agreed objective. Adding up the
                                        “underlying” U.S. deficit (i.e., abstracting from existing
                                        cyclical and random factors in the present deficit) together

                                        an average surplus of $2.5 billion per year, this would
                                        probably mean the need for an annual improvement in our

                                        allocations is undoubtedly too small. In addition, it is
                                        based on the assumption that net additions to world reserves
                                        in the form of U.S. dollars will be $0.5-1.0 billion, rates
                                        which are presently being greatly exceeded and which are
                                        likely to be exceeded for the whole of the first basic
                                        period. If the figure +1.0 billion (the top of the range in
                                        the Managing Director’s proposal) were replaced by-2.5
                                        billion, the present allocation rate of $3.0 billion would
                                        have to be boosted to $6.5 billion to produce the same
                                        aggregate results in terms of world reserves. In the context
                                        of an agreed exchange rate policy aimed at producing a

                                        per year, other countries would necessarily be much more
                                        vulnerable to balance of payments difficulty, and might well
                                        be willing to support a higher rate of <gloss

                        <p>On March 22, 1971, Charles A. Coombs at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
                            York sent a memorandum to the President of the New York Bank, Alfred
                            Hayes, entitled “The Outlook for the Dollar.” In his memorandum Coombs
                            noted that the United States could probably finance its
                            balance-of-payments deficit in 1970 and early 1971, but reported the
                            1971 deficit seemed to be running well above the 1970 levels and thought
                            the United States was “moving into the danger zone.” Coombs discussed
                            ways to obtain balance-of-payments equilibrium and defend the dollar,
                            but then went on to consider options in the event the judgment was made
                            that “the dollar was hopelessly overvalued.” After reviewing the
                            options, he concluded that suspending the dollar’s convertibility to
                            gold, “which could be made effective by executive decision from one
                            minute to the next without prior consultations abroad,” would be the
                            preferred course over arduous and possibly confrontational negotiations
                                <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0450"/>for currency realignments
                            that would be disruptive of foreign exchange markets. (Washington

                            faced with rising dollar inflows. These inflows were discussed by
                            European Community Finance Ministers when they met in Hamburg on April
                            26 and 27. The Embassy in Bonn provided a summary of the meeting in
                            telegram 5156 from Bonn, April 30. German Finance Minister <persName

                            approaches to dealing with the dollar inflows, a temporary joint float
                            of <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> currencies or a multilateral
                            parity adjustment, and personally preferred the former. Only the

                            position, and France was opposed to any measures that would reduce the
                            competitiveness of French export industries “and when pressed declared
                            that if the choice were between inflation and a parity adjustment, they
                            would prefer inflation.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG1"

                                >Henry Kissinger</persName> sent a memorandum to President <persName

                            Switzerland, The Netherlands, Belgium and Austria today suspended dollar
                            operations of their central banks. They did so because of the tremendous
                            inflow of dollars which reached $1 billion in Germany yesterday. It now
                            appears that the dollar operation will continue suspended at least
                            through this weekend.” <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            informed the President that the capital inflows were due to speculation
                            that the Mark, and perhaps other European currencies, would be
                            appreciated against the dollar. He posited possible approaches by France
                            and Germany and suggested that France might use its veto power over
                            British entry into the European Community “to get German acquiescence on
                            French monetary views.” In the end, however, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> concluded no U.S. action was required at that

                        <p>When foreign exchange markets reopened on May 10, the Mark was allowed to
                            float (see <ref target="#d155">Document 155</ref>). The Embassy in Bonn
                            on June 15 reported one responsible German official’s view that the Mark
                            would float for an extended period, possibly beyond the end of the year,
                            and that German industry was becoming reconciled to the float as
                            preferable to exchange controls or a large revaluation. (Telegram 7249

                            <hi rend="italic">The official dollar gold price would not change</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The United States would make clear at the outset of negotiations that it
                            does not regard any change in the official price of gold as part of the
                            negotiations. This posture will be necessary because the French, with
                            varying degrees of support from countries such as Belgium, Switzerland
                            and certain elements in the United Kingdom, may seek a devaluation of
                            the United States dollar in terms of gold. French private citizens hold
                            large amounts of gold on which they would like to make a profit, and
                            Swiss bankers have substantial holdings for their clients and have been
                            managing South African gold sales and on occasion, trying to stimulate
                            gold speculation by their actions and speeches. Both French and British
                            financial interests hold large blocks of South African gold mining
                            stocks. A rise in the official gold price would help the private holders
                            by raising the private market price and enlarging the scope of that
                            market, in the judgment of the French and Swiss.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately the Germans and Italians do not favor an increase in the gold
                            price, so that the French are unlikely to achieve a unified position in
                            the European Community. The Germans and Italians hold very large
                            reserves in dollars, on which they would gain no profit if the official
                            gold price rose. Their officials might even incur criticism because
                            other countries had profited by holding a larger share of their reserves
                            in gold. The Japanese and even the Canadians could also be
                            embarrassed.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The main argument that the French may make is that the United States as
                            the deficit country should devalue, because we have sinned and should
                            expiate. Other countries (France) have devalued and the United States
                            should behave like other countries and do so. Surplus countries should
                            not have to revalue because the United States does not wish to change
                            the price of gold, particularly since these surplus countries have
                            followed virtuous anti-inflation policies and kept their balances of
                            payments in order.</p>
                        <p>The French suggest a moderate increase in the official dollar price,
                            while other countries maintain their existing gold prices or raise them
                            to a lesser degree than the United States thus effecting a change in
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> parities (which are stated in
                            gold) that would depreciate the dollar exchange rate in terms of their
                            currencies.</p>
                        <p>In effect, the French attitude boils down to the suggestion that if the
                            United States does penance and helps the private gold holders to make a
                            bigger capital gain, this would ease the discomfort of appreciating
                            their exchange rate and becoming less competitive with the U.S. in the
                            U.S. market and world markets.</p>

                                    trade practices abroad that have cut back the growth trend in
                                    our agricultural and other exports, and (c) especially by the
                                    undervalued exchange rates which were fixed in the forties and
                                    fifties, at a time when foreign productive capacity was
                                    abnormally low relative to foreign demand, and which have been
                                    jealously preserved for trading advantage. Moreover, the recent

                                    policies in the U.S. and Germany—both needed for their domestic

                                    would establish a strong presumption that the prescription would
                                    be repeated if speculative pressures again became strong, and
                                    dollar reserves built up abroad again. Because central banks
                                    holding gold would have gained a gold profit, while holders of

                                    criticism for holding dollars. This would be likely to induce

                            raises fundamental problems which will persist.</p>
                        <p>The memorandum lists four political trouble points: <list>
                                <item>—European resentment against the United States for our balance
                                    of payments policy, which contributed to the crisis.</item>
                                <item>—U.S. Congressional hostility toward a German revaluation,
                                    which will increase costs of troop support in Europe.</item>
                                <item>—Internal strains within the Common Market over delay in
                                        <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> monetary unity and
                                    particularly over inevitable adjustments in the Common
                                    Agricultural Policy.</item>
                                <item>—Spill over effects on British entry negotiations.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>

                        <p>The markets today have been relatively quiet with a comparatively small
                            transfer of money. Though the Germans got pretty much what they
                            wanted—Community agreement to their float—the agreement was dressed up
                            in such a way that the Community appeared to reach a collective
                            decision. The Germans did promise to put into effect some of the
                            controls the other members wanted and to aim at restoration of the
                            previous exchange parities. Consequently, since there is no public
                            admission that the other members were faced down, some of the bitterness
                            mentioned in State’s memorandum may be avoided.</p>
                        <p>Most of the European central bankers do blame the United States for the
                            underlying circumstances that brought on the revaluation, but generally
                            the governments have avoided pointing too much in our direction.</p>
                        <p>We should be able to counter any Congressional reaction on higher troop
                            costs with the solid economic argument that the German revaluation will
                            contribute to improved U.S. balance of payments. We shall, however,
                            definitely feel this pressure in regard to German offset
                            arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Community disputes over the Common Agricultural Policy would be dampened
                            by a reasonable German position at Tuesday’s meeting of the Agricultural
                            Ministers although much will depend here on how much the Germans insist
                            upon avoiding any lowering of their farmers’ high agricultural prices.
                            However, France will resent the delay in implementation of <gloss
                                target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> monetary unity. The weekend’s events made
                            it obvious that such unity would at best be tenuous until closer
                            agreement is reached on common monetary and fiscal policies, as the
                            Germans had clearly prophesied.</p>
                        <p>Reports from France so far do not indicate that the French will seize the
                            revaluation as an excuse to fight the Germans on UK entry, but this
                            issue will not be clear for some time. The final result may even favor
                            French support for British entry, since the German power play will alert
                            the French that they may need help in controlling a stubborn and strong
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>Though the German/Dutch float and the Austrian/Swiss 5 to 7 percent
                            revaluations have undoubtedly caused great turmoil in financial circles,
                            we have definitely gained on the economic front because of the impetus
                            that these moves will give toward greater exchange flexibility, which is
                            an essential element for continued liberal trade policies. In addition,
                            German and French persistence in appearing to reach accord within the
                            framework of the Community policy apparatus will have a positive effect
                            despite the fact that the currency crisis has shaken some of the
                            substance of agreed Community policies.</p>

                            and thought the fact that President <persName corresp="#p_PG5"

                            devalue. We are not going to change the price of gold …. No longer can
                            considerations of friendship, or need, or capacity justify the United

                        <p>M. Giscard explained that he was here to promote a French export drive in
                            the United States, adding that France is one of the U.S.’s best trading
                            partners. The U.S. has a surplus of $800 million in trade. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> asked if this
                            included tourism and remarked that tourism was a sizable offset to the
                            trade surplus. M. Giscard remarked that the U.S. main bilateral deficit
                            was with Japan and Canada. He added that France is not bilateral minded,
                            but he believes that exports are a good test of competitiveness. He is
                            promoting sales of electrical and other machinery and also steel.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> remarked that
                            the Japanese will run both the U.S. and France out of business in steel
                            if we are not careful. There was a discussion of Japanese wage levels
                            and competitive ability.</p>
                        <p>M. Giscard turned to the subject of the recent monetary turmoil saying
                            that this had been felt much more acutely in Europe than in the U.S.,
                            insofar as he gathered from reading the U.S. press. In Europe there was
                            a feeling of real crisis. France, however, had remained calm as she was
                            not directly concerned, having been insulated from the monetary flows.
                            While France agreed with her Common Market partners not to let her views
                            be openly known, <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> felt
                            that some parts of the German Government want the float to end up in a
                            revaluation while other parts do not. This ambiguity on the part of the
                            Germans is likely to impair the European monetary union.</p>
                        <p>M. Giscard felt there was a new feeling in the (Saturday night)
                            Ministerial meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">Presumably a reference
                                to a May 8 European Community Ministerial meeting; see <ref

                            had been the “bad boys,” by <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0463"
                            />being relatively inflexible in their views while the Germans were in
                            part more flexible. In the recent crisis the Germans spread rumors and
                            declared that the real cause of inflation was the inflow of dollars. The
                            American attitude for some time, said <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1"
                                >Giscard</persName>, had been to pursue discussions of exchange
                            flexibility in the expectation that other countries could be induced to
                            revalue their currencies from time to time as necessary, but for the
                            first time <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> detects a
                            willingness in Europe not to revalue. Notably, the Italians were very
                            firm on this point and some of the Germans as well. Therefore, said
                                <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName>, the route of
                            revaluation is closed.</p>
                        <p>At the same time the attitude of central banks will change. They will not
                            want to accumulate any more dollars. This will lead us to a
                            multiplication of restrictions and regulations in the Western world, a
                            very unpleasant development in <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1"
                                >Giscard</persName>’s view. While France has maintained currency
                            restrictions, <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> does not
                            feel they are a good thing in the long run and if they proliferate it
                            would be very damaging.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> objected to the idea
                            that the U.S. had engaged in discussions of exchange flexibility in an
                            effort to induce expected revaluations. He could understand confusion on
                            this point because some individuals have made statements to this effect,
                            but it is not the view of the government. Indeed, it was difficult for
                            him to visualize effective arrangements if other currencies were
                            repeatedly revalued against the dollar. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> expressed his agreement with
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>’s statement
                            emphasizing that he could name individuals who believe in a high degree
                            of exchange rate flexibility and that revaluation by other countries are
                            the basic answer to our problems. These statements are misleading
                            because they do not represent government policy. Government policy, the
                            Secretary added, was made in the Treasury, the White House and the
                            Federal Reserve Board. He had had many discussions with Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName> and the two were in agreement in
                            opposing floating rates.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary added that it is, in his opinion, impossible to expect
                            monetary arrangements to deal with all of the economic conflicts among
                            nations. For example, the Germans have their problems with inflation. We
                            have ours, which are the reverse. Many of the problems are political in
                            nature. The Secretary pointed out that the U.S. Government had taken
                            very tough political decisions in 1969 and 1970. In order to cure
                            inflation we have a 6 percent unemployment rate, which is a politically
                            difficult situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized that we have not been practicing benign neglect
                            for the past 25 years. He reiterated that monetary means alone are not
                            enough to solve the problem. He added that we do not like to see $50
                            billion in the Eurodollar market with no controls. The steps we <pb
                                n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0464"/>have taken during the crisis
                            were designed to calm the waters, but it might be that greater
                            flexibility around parities would serve to counter the enormous capital
                            flows of the type we have been seeing. The U.S. does not want to see
                            exchange controls if they can be avoided.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that the monetary system is tied to the dollar
                            not because we wanted it that way, but because it grew up that way. What
                            good would it do, he asked rhetorically, if we should devalue? He
                            pointed out for example that yen revaluation would in itself not much
                            help the U.S. because of the many Japanese restrictions on imports.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized that this government does not want go back to
                            isolationism and that the Mansfield Amendment<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d156fn3">Not further identified. Mansfield and a number of
                                other members of Congress had proposed amendments restricting U.S.
                                activities overseas to curtail U.S. involvement in Southeast
                                Asia.</note> defeat was a reflection of that. However, basic trade
                            adjustments are needed and the U.S. spends too much abroad. As an
                            example of the needed adjustments in trade, he cited the fact that five
                            years ago Canada was in trouble while we had a $640 million surplus with
                            Canada. As a result we signed the Auto Agreement and now that surplus
                            has been turned into a substantial deficit. This Agreement was unfair
                            and has to be restructured.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the subject of inflation, the Secretary complimented the
                            Minister on his recent analysis of his internal inflation problem,
                            pointing out that the U.S. and France had the same problems—built in
                            wage demands by labor. He cited in the U.S. the construction industry,
                            the railroads and steel. He added that with regard to incomes policies,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> does not want to
                            take half-way measures. But if the President decides to have an incomes
                            policy, he will go all the way to some kind of mandatory system rather
                            than take half-way measures such as some wage price advisory board where
                            he could not enforce the recommendation. This is the reason for the
                            President’s hesitation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we are trying to expand the economy gradually.
                            The inflation rate is down to 3 percent in the first quarter but will go
                            up somewhat for the year. We will stabilize, but we cannot expect to
                            cure the balance of payments problem this year. That situation should be
                            a lot better in 1972 and 1973. In the meantime, we must get back to
                            stability with perhaps a little more flexibility by way perhaps of wider
                            bands or otherwise.</p>
                        <p>M. Giscard said that he does not oppose wider bands per se. However, the
                            problem lies in whether international public opinion will believe that a
                            currency going to one margin of a wider band will return to its parity
                            again. Otherwise flexibility may lead to further speculation. For
                            example, if the DM after the present float returns to its former parity,
                                <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0465"/>this will be a good lesson
                            and a good argument for greater flexibility. If however the DM does not,
                            the speculators will remember and will not believe that the next
                            currency which floats or moves will return to its parity.</p>
                        <p>M. Giscard pointed out that over the past ten years there has been a U.S.
                            balance of payments deficit. This gives rise to skepticism about the
                            U.S. desire not to have others revalue. It also has given rise to
                            saturation of the rest of the world with dollars. Now, said M. Giscard,
                            we need proposals for the use of the dollars thus accumulated. Others do
                            not want to hold more dollars. The recent problems are likely to
                            recommence and therefore we must think about this in advance.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> pointed out
                            that in 1969 we had sopped up dollars from the Eurodollar market and in
                            1970-71 we paid them back again. Now we will have to prove to the
                            skeptics about our balance of payments. To do this we must cut back
                            foreign spending and that means other countries, in particular Japan,
                            Canada and Germany, must contribute more to defense and aid. Twenty
                            years ago, said the Secretary, we were relatively rich in productive
                            capacity and reserves but this is no longer the case. The Mansfield
                            Amendment is in part a reflection of the reality that we have been
                            spending too much.</p>
                        <p>M. Giscard warned that if there are no joint actions to stabilize the
                            international monetary system he foresaw increasing exchange controls on
                            the European side.</p>

                                identified.</note> M. Giscard said it was regrettable that the
                            European monetary union had been damaged, the more so because of
                            (interesting phrase, spoken in French and not translated) Britain’s

                        <p>We have just muddled through another international monetary crisis. We
                            can congratulate ourselves that we have so far escaped the worst of
                            outcomes—which would have been commitment to restriction of the domestic
                            economy and widespread controls both at home and abroad. However, we
                            cannot be sure of having escaped entirely or permanently. Several
                            countries, notably Japan, have introduced new controls. Protectionists
                            in Congress and elsewhere interpret the event as additional evidence
                            that the U.S. cannot hold its own in an open world economy. On the other
                            hand the experience of the last few months, allowing a “crisis” to
                            develop and then floating outside the rules of the system, is too
                            uncertain and risky to be repeated.</p>
                        <p>A system that combines rigidly fixed exchange rates with free trade and
                            capital movements appears to be unworkable. But the recent practice of
                            unregulated exchange rate changes and floating disrupts the monetary
                            order that has generally prevailed so far. There seem to be two
                            alternatives—either more extensive use of direct controls to support a
                            system of fixed exchange rates or an internationally—agreed upon system
                            of greater flexibility. You recognized this two years ago and opted for
                            the second alternative when you decided (in June 1969)<note n="2"

                            that the U.S. would propose and support a study of greater flexibility

                            has not so far led to concrete results because some countries do not
                            like its conclusions while the attitude of some of our own
                            representatives has been lukewarm at best.</p>
                        <p>If we allow things to drift further we may well wind up with more
                            extensive use of direct controls, which would be highly burdensome to
                            our trade and investment interests. Our businessmen and bankers also
                            appear to be generally opposed to wider use of floating rates.<note

                        <p>I believe a decision has to be made urgently on the direction in which we
                            would like the international monetary system to develop. In my opinion
                            our best course would be to support implementation of the <gloss

                        <p>I recommend that you convene the Council on International Economic Policy
                            to reassert our position in favor of an updating of the <gloss

                            already been done so there is no need for another lengthy in-house

                            extensive controls, and our interest in working with other nations to
                            adapt the international monetary system to contemporary needs.<note

                                >McCracken</persName> on June 2 on international monetary reform has
                            just come to my attention.<note n="2" xml:id="d158fn2">
                                <ref target="#d157">Document 157</ref>.</note> I must take vigorous
                            personal exception to its premises and conclusions.</p>
                        <p>The simple fact is that, given our present international economic and
                            financial position, some monetary disturbances—which the press will
                            label “crises”—are virtually inevitable. The test is whether these can
                            be met without impairing our basic domestic (or international)
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>Far from “muddling through” the recent disturbance, I believe these
                            essential objectives were maintained: <list>

                                    deflate concern over a “dollar crisis.” Pressures for strong
                                    domestic action, either with respect to higher interest rates or
                                    strongly intensified controls (or both) never built up.</item>

                                <item>By making the point that the “crisis” grew most immediately
                                    out of domestic German political and economic concerns, we
                                    helped limit the repercussions on the dollar and set the stage
                                    for maintaining the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>’s role

                        <p>Changes in our present international economic and financial position must
                            be achieved without—and this is the key—undermining confidence in the
                            dollar and the general stability of the monetary system. Should we fail,
                            forces of economic nationalism and isolation in one country after the
                            other—including the United States—could become unmanageable.</p>
                        <p>I do not underestimate the extent to which the problems are complicated
                            by differing views among economists and businessmen, and among
                            countries. In particular, I believe we must realize there is a strong
                            element of thinking within Europe that would take advantage of weakness
                            or clumsiness on our part to promote the Common Market not as a partner
                            but as a rival economic bloc, competing vigorously with the dollar and
                            reducing or shutting out, as best it can, U.S. economic influence from a
                            considerable portion of the world.</p>
                        <p>These threats to monetary and economic order will require action in a
                            wide variety of areas. Most important is success in dealing with
                            inflation and growth at home. In the vital areas of trade, aid, and a
                            better sharing of defense costs, where a clear focus for Government
                            policy-making has been absent, the Council on International Economic
                            Policy obviously has a lead role.</p>
                        <p>But one distinction should be clear. As I have understood it, the genesis
                            of <gloss target="#t_CIEP1">CIEP</gloss> did not lie in an idea it could
                            or should take over the role of responsible operating agencies. In the
                            international monetary area, that role, by law and tradition, lies under
                            your direction with the Treasury, which, in turn, must operate in close
                            coordination with the Federal Reserve.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, I fail to see the merit in convening <gloss
                                target="#t_CIEP1">CIEP</gloss> to “reassert” in general terms a
                            position with respect to exchange rate flexibility that only a few days
                            ago I reiterated in Munich.<note n="3" xml:id="d158fn3">Reference is to

                            of recent developments, it is hard for me to see how informed observers
                            could think the flexibility issue is dead. But its specifics do involve
                            difficult tactical as well as substantive questions upon which important
                            countries are not agreed. These questions are under active review within
                            the Treasury and in the <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>

                            will be kept informed—they are, indeed, participating. But I do not
                            think it useful or productive to convene a <gloss target="#t_CIEP1"

                            “recommendation for action.” The President further suggested that we
                            “move on the problem, “ not “just wait for it to hit us again—e.g. in
                            the fall of ‘72.”</p>
                        <p>He noted particularly the last paragraph of page 2—the part which
                            recommends that he convene the Council on International Economic Policy
                            to reassert our position in favor of an updating of <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> rules. His (the President’s) comments
                            were: “No—this is too large a group with too many people who talk a lot
                            about subjects they know little about”.</p>
                        <p>The President went on to say, in writing, “The <persName

                        <p>Hidden in the minds of economists are certain presuppositions from the
                            theory of international trade—inclusive of obsolescent elements—which
                            many of us carry about as relics of our graduate student days. The basic
                            premise is the existence of self-equilibrating mechanisms bringing
                            appropriate adjustments of trade and payments—and operating without fail
                            on all nations. (There should be no exception, at least among nations
                            that adhere to the rules of the game.) Flowing from this premise are
                            entrancing visions of adjustments achieved through smoothly-functioning
                            monetary and price mechanisms. The vision is commendable; the departure
                            from reality is substantial; so that the overall impression approaches
                            “the dreamland of equilibrium” as <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Arthur
                                Burns</persName> phrased it in another connection.<note n="2"

                        </p>
                        <p>The processes of adjustment, whether price-level or exchange rate, are
                            based on the presumed willingness of all major trading nations to adhere
                            to the rules of the game. Earlier theorists did not envision the range
                            of measures available to put off the required day of adjustment. No
                            nation, guilty of deviant behavior, would have a major share of trade or
                            of capital flows. If necessary, enlightened self interest would elicit
                            the appropriate degree of game-plan behavior. A situation such as the
                            present in which one nation, the United States, serves as international
                            banker and upholds a system of relatively fixed exchange rates on which
                            it has virtually no direct influence was not envisaged.</p>
                        <p>In one sense, the older attitude was enshrined in the Bretton Woods
                            agreement. The notion of “fundamental disequilibrium” was more than a
                            technical concept; it was a moral concept in that it distinguished
                            between proper and improper behavior and pointed directly to those
                            nations which were failing to adhere to the rules of the game. In the
                            Bretton Woods concept no nation was to be permitted <pb n="447"
                                xml:id="pg_447" facs="0475"/>to follow beggar-my-neighbor policies.
                            In this concept, use of an undervalued exchange rate to enhance domestic
                            employment and production at the expense of others was clearly
                                proscribed.<note n="3" xml:id="d161fn3">Although he did not use

                        </p>
                        <p>How different is our world today in which undervalued exchange rates are
                            employed by major states engrossing a considerable share of
                            international trade. These are clearly beggar-my-neighbor policies in
                            the older conception and (you should try to make it so) in the new.
                            Undervaluing the yen, for example, by a full 20 percent is a
                            beggar-my-neighbor policy. There is no reason that the United States
                            should be willing graciously to tolerate such a condition. While the
                            methods of adjustment today, self-equilibrating or otherwise, are much
                            weaker than hitherto, the case for moral and political force grows so
                            much stronger. I would take it to be primarily your job to harness such
                            moral and political forces.</p>
                        <p>The impact of undervalued currencies, perennially in a state of
                            “fundamental disequilibrium” without adequate adjustment, underlies many
                            of our trading problems. The undervaluing of foreign currencies works a
                            particular hardship on producers of goods as opposed to producers of
                            services. The existence of palliatives and patch-up mechanisms means
                            that such producers of goods are subject year after year to these
                            hardships, which might as well be described as an unfair degree of
                            competition.</p>
                        <p>The fundamental point, however, is the following: these hardships ought
                            not to be dealt with and cannot be cured by patch-up adjustments on the
                            trade side. This would lead only to a jerry-built structure of controls
                            and to inefficiencies. One must go to the heart of the matter—i.e., the
                            monetary machinery and adjustments of the structure of exchange rate.
                            This is the kernel of truth in the observation of your economist
                            critics, that too much stress is being given to the decline of American
                            competitiveness and that monetary adjustments should substantially
                            alleviate the problem. By and large this is true. But such adjustments
                            do not come about automatically; there are no self-equilibrating
                            mechanisms. That is what is wrong with their arguments. What is required
                            is a code of behavior or a new set of rules to which the major nations
                            will adhere either voluntarily or per force. To develop such a code and
                            provide vitality for it is your principal task.</p>
                        <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0476"/>
                        <p>It is a truism that comparative advantage varies with and depends upon
                            the exchange rate. An adequate set of exchange rates would eliminate
                            many of the problems of the producer groups—in autos certainly and in
                            steel to a lesser degree. It would also lead us very close to a balance
                            of payments equilibrium that would be maintainable in the long run.</p>
                        <p>Under such conditions many problems associated with the so-called “U.S.
                            loss of competitiveness” would disappear. Of course, the standard of
                            living in the United States would grow in ratio to increased efficiency
                            in production, but the pace of efficiency in the U.S. vis-à-vis the
                            other countries would no longer be the type of problem that it is today.
                            From the standpoint of self-esteem and perhaps national power, the
                            problem would remain, but it would not spill over into crippling of the
                            performance of the economic machinery.</p>
                        <p>This also bears immediately and directly on the structure of U.S. trade.
                            The undervaluing of foreign currencies has fostered an undue dependence
                            upon high-technology products. Rather than cure the disease, we seem
                            ready to embrace the effects of the disease. Since we have steadily in
                            the years after World War II, in effect, subsidized high technology
                            products, it should come as no surprise that these products make a major
                            contribution in the sale of U.S. goods abroad.</p>
                        <p>However, a goal of achieving balance by the subsidization of high
                            technology products to compensate for the discrimination practiced
                            against our products in general seems less than ideal. Once again, the
                            moral seems clear: elimination of the discrimination practiced through
                            undervalued currencies or quantitative restrictions against U.S.
                            products is the way to proceed. This is economically more efficient and
                            politically more reasonable than reliance upon and subsidy of
                            high-technology products. High-technology products, which others cannot
                            produce and are inclined to accept, are a desirable part of our trade
                            pattern; they should not be viewed as a means of deliverance from
                            undesirable conditions created by persistent exploitation of the U.S.
                            international position as banker and world leader.</p>
                        <p>What should be done about these matters? It is inefficient and unjust to
                            use tariffs, or general trade barriers, or general adjustments of the
                            exchange rate to deal with the problems created by the violation of the
                            rules of the game by a few of the major trading states who in the
                            present era are consciously exploiting the absence of self-equilibrating
                            mechanisms. To deal with beggar-my-neighbor policies and the maintenance
                            of fundamental disequilibria for exploitational purposes requires a
                            sense of discrimination in the better meaning of that word. Given the
                            structure of the international economy at the present time, the most
                            favored nation clause provides unintended protection for the very <pb
                                n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0477"/>nations which are indulging in
                            exploitative practices. We should recognize the problem and deal with it
                            on that basis. A Tariff Commission finding, for example, which hurts all
                            nations is not the most desirable way to proceed—when the fault lies
                            with a single nation which has a drastically undervalued currency. To
                            proceed in that manner is inefficient and unfair. We should deal with
                            the real problem without hurting bystanders. If this requires
                            reexamination of the traditional bromides, so be it. This will require
                            careful examination of the arsenal of tools which can deal specifically
                            with the offenders. And these tools should be employed in such a manner
                            that they deal with the fundamental problems—of monetary and price
                            maladjustments—so that they contribute directly or indirectly to a
                            closer achievement of equilibrium. The importance of avoiding further
                            expanding of a jerry-built structure of trade and capital restraints
                            should be kept in mind.</p>

                        <p>“We appreciate your concern and the difficulties to which you alluded. We
                            recognize that pressing for a decision on limited exchange rate
                            flexibility can create problem not only for you, but possibly also for
                            others because of more general speculative pressure that could be
                            induced by discussion of this matter. For that reason, our initiative in

                            paralleled by public discussion. Nevertheless, we felt several factors
                            made it desirable to present to the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                            Board more concrete proposals on the flexibility question at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>“From past discussion, we were particularly aware of the problems which
                            the French authorities have raised with respect to flexibility, and we
                            felt important elements in our proposal would be more acceptable to
                            French view than other flexibility proposals which have been discussed.
                            Speaking frankly, we hoped we could identify some areas of common
                            ground.</p>
                        <p>“In particular, wider bands would under our approach not be generalized
                            but would be adopted at the option of an individual <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> member (or group of members) where, for
                            example, that member felt the wider margins would be useful in dealing
                            with disequilibrating movements of mobile capital.</p>
                        <p>“In the case of the transitional float, our approach envisages the float
                            essentially as a method of changing exchange rates. Thus a finding of
                            fundamental disequilibrium would be required (as with any exchange rate
                            change). A Fund review process is envisaged, and the Fund would be
                            empowered to set conditions on the float or to withdraw authority for a
                            continuation of the float. This should provide protection against too

                        <p>“These conditions are designed to recognize and encourage fixed parities
                            as the norm, with an explicit international code of good behavior with
                            respect to the use of ‘flexible’ options.</p>
                        <p>“On the other hand, we recognize that the width of the band mentioned in
                            our approach—up to 2-1/2 or 3 percent on either side of parity—goes
                            beyond French thinking. Our view is that the short-term capital flow
                            problem is of serious concern and that an option for margins of this
                            size may be needed as one of the tools for dealing with it. We
                            understand, of course, that the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> faces
                            problems in dealing with the question of wider margins which do not
                            confront individual countries. However, the framework we have proposed
                            was designed to avoid any special difficulty for the <gloss

                            wider margins.</p>
                        <p>“Throughout the discussions in the Fund and <gloss target="#t_G101"
                                >G-10</gloss>, the U.S. had, as you know, refrained from presenting
                            its views with any precision, in part to see whether a broader consensus
                            might emerge among the <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> members.
                            However, if progress is to be achieved in September, we felt that this
                            was the last opportunity to table a clear statement of U.S. thinking,
                            prior to the August vacation period, in order to give foreign officials
                                <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0479"/>time to reflect on a
                            specific proposal. We have no intention of pressing for agreement within

                            discussions; now that our suggested approach is on the table, we do not
                            intend to take further initiative in the matter until we can see whether
                            there is a possibility of reconciling present differences among the
                                <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> members in the <gloss

                            Meanwhile, the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> can shape its own views
                            with some clearer indications of the views of its trading partners.</p>
                        <p>“I would not pretend that the approach we have outlined necessarily
                            represents our final thinking on the subject. Nevertheless, we have been
                            concerned that in the absence of some consensus on appropriate rules of
                            conduct, individual countries, in response to speculative pressures or
                            otherwise, may revert excessively to use of exchange rates as a
                            supplementary tool of domestic policy, as recent events have
                            demonstrated. We have tried to set forth an approach consistent with the
                            general thrust and spirit of the Bretton Woods objectives. We are
                            interested in hearing the reactions of others in the hope that a broad
                            consensus can be reached in September. Certainly, an early resolution of
                            this matter would be in the interest of all.”<note n="4"

                        <p>The distressed foreign exchange markets of May 1971 had calmed in June
                            and July but as August began were roiled again. President <persName

                            />9:58 a.m. on August 2. The discussion opened on domestic issues,
                            specifically rail and steel strikes. During that discussion
                            Congressional and private sector support for an incomes policy was
                            raised, and the President was sympathetic, saying it was necessary to
                            convince the public the administration was doing something. Shortly
                            before his departure at 10:28 a.m., <persName corresp="#p_SGP1"
                                >Shultz</persName> turned the discussion to international monetary
                            policy and told <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> they
                            needed, in the next few days, to discuss <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName>’s proposals, which needed careful
                            consideration. <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> thought
                            that whether or not to do the “big steps” should be “examined
                            carefully.” Following <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>’
                            departure <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> stayed on
                            until 11:53 a.m. <persName corresp="#p_HHR1">Haldeman</persName> entered
                            late in this segment but was generally silent. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> outlined forcefully for the
                            President, with great specificity, virtually all the essential elements
                            of the New Economic Policy the President would announce on August 15. On
                            the domestic side <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> set
                            out the wage/price freeze, reinstitution of the investment tax credit,
                            and various expenditure reductions and/or deferrals, with numbers to
                            illustrate exactly what would be the impact on the budget. On the
                            international side he set out suspending convertibility and floating the
                            dollar and the 10 percent import surcharge, which at one point he even
                            portrayed as part of the domestic program, bringing $4 billion annually
                            to the budget. On the international side the only missing element was
                            the 10 percent reduction in foreign assistance expenditures. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> insisted the domestic and
                            international aspects of the program were linked, with the domestic
                            measures indicating U.S. willingness to take difficult measures to
                            defend the dollar. <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>
                            thought convertibility could not be maintained through the 1972 election
                            and probably would have to be suspended before the end of the year. He
                            urged the President to act soon, to show that he was in charge of events
                            rather than responding to them, and to show that he had the courage to
                            take a position before being forced into it.</p>
                        <p>As <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> pressed his program,
                            the President warmed to it, despite his reservations about a wage/price
                            freeze and closing the gold window. They discussed alternatives: acting
                            that week, before Congress adjourned on August 4, during the coming
                            week, or during the week after Congress reconvened in September or in
                            November, which would still allow time to lift the wage/price freeze
                            before the election in November 1972. The President was inclined to
                            favor a November/December timeframe, but <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> warned of the increasing danger of leaks if the
                            program were delayed. As <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> prepared to leave, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> was leaning toward acting during
                            August if necessary, possibly as early as Friday of that week. The
                            President said that if consultations abroad were required, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> should take it up with
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> who had channels to
                            Pompidou, Heath, and Brandt. <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0483"
                            />Under no circumstances was the State Department to be consulted as
                            that agency represented foreign governments. Within the administration,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> thought <persName
                                corresp="#p_PPG1">Peterson</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCPW1">McCracken</persName> were on board for the
                            program, but that <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName> would have to be
                            convinced.</p>
                        <p>Following <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>’s departure
                            the President reviewed what would become the New Economic Policy with
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHR1">Haldeman</persName>. The latter viewed
                                <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> as a free trader.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> would oppose the wage/price
                            freeze and thought he was also concerned that during the 1972
                            Presidential campaign the President would be portrayed as the one who
                            had devalued the dollar.</p>

                            return to the Oval Office at 1:24 p.m. (which was not recorded in the
                            Daily Diary), and when the discussion turned to the New Economic Policy,
                            the President was hesitant to go with the international part of the
                            program. He thought closing the gold window could be held in reserve,
                            but the administration could go ahead with the domestic measures to
                            strengthen the dollar. <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>
                            pressed for a linked domestic and international program. He said that
                            gold would have to be done within 3-4 months and that former Federal
                            Reserve Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MWMCJ1">Martin</persName> agreed,
                            but if that measure were undertaken alone it would have no concurrent
                            domestic measures for cover. The President agreed, sent <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> off to bring <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> along, and asked him to report
                            back after 4 p.m. that day. (National Archives, <persName

                                >Connally</persName> on August 4 from 2:19 to 2:55 p.m. in the Oval
                            Office. The two discussed several aspects of the program and the
                            President seemed to be on board. <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName>, thumping the desk, advised the President not
                            to defend or explain what was happening, but instead simply to
                            acknowledge there were problems that the administration will solve. He
                            advised the President to create the perception that he was as interested
                            in domestic as foreign affairs, where he already enjoyed high marks, and
                            said that when they returned in September and the President took the
                            strong actions, that perception would change overnight. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> advised against attempting to
                            change the perception during August, but told the President he would
                            have no choice but to do something before bilateral meetings with the
                            Japanese scheduled for September 9 (see <ref target="#d75">Document
                                75</ref>) and before the Bank/Fund meetings in Washington at the end
                            of September. The President said they needed to run against the tide;
                            they needed to turn the tide. <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> used a stampede analogy: do not run in front of
                            the cattle but alongside the cattle and gradually turn them. He said
                            this “dramatic action” would do it.</p>

                        <p>Midway through that meeting they were joined by Shultz. The three then
                            discussed several unrelated domestic issues before <persName

                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> on the new program. The
                            President thought the positives outweighed the negatives and that the
                            day after Congress returned in September would be the best time to
                            announce the program, which would give delegates to the Japanese
                            bilateral meetings and the Bank/Fund meetings time to get instructions.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> was to work it out.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> stated, somewhat in
                            the form of a question, “You have decided to go with this big program,
                            including the gold window and all that? Our task between now and
                            September 8 is to think it through.” The President said he needed to
                            have it by August 23 to have time to reflect on it. He was concerned
                            with leaks and said it was to be just between the three of them;
                                <persName corresp="#p_PPG1">Peterson</persName> was not to be told.

                            weakening of the dollar against other currencies and the amounts of
                            dollars that had been taken that day. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                            that the dollar was overvalued and that unless exchange rates were
                            realigned the United States would unilaterally have to suspend the
                            dollar’s convertibility to gold and establish new parities, contributed
                            to the flurry of activity that day. The Reuss report is <hi

                        <p>An August 7 Treasury press release regarding the Reuss report stated it
                            did not reflect a “wide body of Congressional opinion” and there were no

                            noted that the U.S. approach to these matters had recently been
                            discussed by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>

                        <p>Foreign central banks continued to take large dollar inflows during the
                            week of August 9, 1971. In that atmosphere Office of Management and
                            Budget Director <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">George Shultz</persName> met
                            with the President from 4:45 to 6:31 p.m. on Wednesday, August 11, in
                            the President’s office in the Executive Office Building. The tape of
                            that conversation is of poor quality and many parts of the conversation
                            are inaudible, but it is clear that the focus of the discussion was on
                            the implementation of what the President would announce on August 15 as
                            the New Economic Policy. The President acknowledged that “Arthur
                                [<persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName>] is very nervous about
                            this.” <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> said that if the
                            United States took this aggressive act against its trading partners, it
                            was to stabilize a situation all agreed needing correction, and that the
                            United States would have to follow up with constructive proposals.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> counseled the President
                            that if he were to close the gold window and took no other action, he
                            might not get the needed change in the exchange rate if others
                            intervened to maintain the value of their currencies. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> told the President his instinct
                            to equate a 10 percent border tax with a devaluation was exactly right,
                            that other nations did the same thing. <persName corresp="#p_SGP1"
                                >Shultz</persName> advised that it was better to get the desired
                            change through a devaluation than through an import tax and suggested an
                            immediate closing of the gold window and a temporary import tax, i.e., a
                            devaluation, followed by negotiations. As the conversation concluded,
                            the President seemed to lean toward undertaking some of the program as
                            early as Friday, August 13, but also thought the program might be timed
                            to coincide with the return of Congress in September. (National

                            President that <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> had all
                            the information and they could expect a bad day on Friday. He thought
                            “we are losing the initiative.” The President and <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> exchanged views on doing the
                            program piecemeal, perhaps as early as that evening or Friday morning,
                            or doing the entire program at one time, the approach <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> preferred. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> did not want to leave the
                            impression they had acted “in haste” and “were unprepared.” The
                            President invited <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> to
                            come directly to his office upon his arrival in Washington. (Ibid.,

                            his office at the Executive Office Building during the afternoon of
                            August 12 and requested that Haldeman join them. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> reviewed the scale of dollar
                            conversions since August 2 and thought the U.S. reserve and negotiating
                            position were weakening. The President thought they should not panic. He
                            said they were not ready to go ahead with the entire package, but that
                            if all the key players went to Camp David they could be prepared to act
                            by Monday. He thought September 7 was the right day to do the whole
                            package, including the budget provisions, but that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> could announce in a low-key
                            way now that the gold window was closed due to speculation. He thought
                            the wage/price freeze could also be done immediately and then on
                            September 7 he could announce the remainder of the program. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHR1">Haldeman</persName> recapped: close the window and
                            slap on the freeze now and come back in 3 weeks with the rest of the
                            package. The President thought most of his advisers would concur in the
                            program but that <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>, who was “obsessed”
                            with international things, would have difficulty with its international
                            aspects and would have to be brought along. <persName corresp="#p_SGP1"
                                >Shultz</persName> should try to sell the program to <persName

                            were only two or three choices, and the President wanted to know which
                            one <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName> would go along with.

                            to 7 p.m. on August 12 in the Executive Office Building. The President
                            set out three policy options. First, to prevent speculation <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> could make a low key,
                            non-prime-time announcement that the gold window was temporarily closed
                            and that the administration was prepared to discuss with other nations
                            now a “new, better, more stable system.” <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> could also say the administration would take
                            action on the budget front when Congress returned, but remain silent on
                            the wage/price freeze. The second option was to announce now the
                            wage/price freeze and intentions to present a legislative package when
                            Congress returned. International aspects could be negotiated as needed,
                            in lieu of a unilateral closing of the gold window. The third option was
                            to close the gold window and announce the wage/price freeze, which were
                            the only actions required to deal with the current crisis, and the
                            legislative package could be prepared for September 7. The downside of
                            that approach, the President said to <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName>, was that it missed his “big, bold” approach,
                            but, he mused, could we do the whole program now, tonight? Tomorrow
                            night? Let’s go to Camp David tomorrow and announce the whole program on
                            Monday, he continued.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> thought the President
                            needed to convince the American people that he had thought through the
                            entire program. If it were done piecemeal, the public would speculate on
                            “what comes next.” Ideally the entire package would be announced on
                            September 7, he said, but due to international developments they could
                            not wait that long. If they just did the gold window at that time, it
                            would give the impression the President was “forced to do it” because of
                            what had happened in Europe during the last 2 weeks, that he did not
                            know what to do, and that it took until September 7 to figure it out. To
                            date, <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> went on, there
                            was no public speculation on a comprehensive package, and if the
                            President did it all now it would give the impression he knew what was
                            happening and was on top of it; “you picked the time.”</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName> thought they should do the
                            domestic program now, including the border tax, and see if that would
                            stabilize the dollar. <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>
                            argued that if they were to do the domestic program now, they should go
                            ahead and close the gold window as well, rather than wait until the
                            following week, a point the President thought was well taken. The
                            President proposed, and <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> concurred, that
                            they meet at Camp David over the weekend “to set the whole thing up.”

                            the better.” <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> suggested
                            that at Camp David all should be encouraged to participate in the
                            discussion, without their letting on that the decisions had already been
                            made. <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> said that at Camp
                            David it would be necessary to set up sub-meetings to develop the
                            specifics of various parts of the program. The President agreed and said
                            he had pretty much decided what he wanted to do; following perhaps a
                            3-hour meeting beginning at 3 p.m. on Friday to develop an agreement,
                            they would break into groups and reconvene Saturday at 3 p.m., which
                            would give him time to prepare his speech. <persName corresp="#p_SGP1"
                                >Shultz</persName> suggested giving the speech on Sunday night to
                            prevent speculation on Monday, a point the President took, provided they
                            could get it ready. The conversation concluded with the three discussing
                            the essential modalities for secrecy surrounding the Camp David meeting.

                        </p>
                        <p>The dollar is under severe pressure in major financial markets in Europe
                            and Japan. By pressure I refer to the fact that the dollar is worth less
                            in terms of such currencies as the German mark, Dutch guilder and
                            Canadian dollar, which are floating, and that enormous amounts of
                            dollars are being purchased by central banks in other financial centers
                            in order to comply with the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> rules of
                            maintaining parity relationships between their currencies and the
                            dollar.</p>
                        <p>In this atmosphere impressive sums are moving speculatively, betting that
                            the dollar will be devalued. Large companies are hedging in order not to
                            lose money should this occur. Countries like Japan, which hold large
                            amounts of dollars as a proportion of total foreign reserves, are
                            uncertain as to what to do since a devaluation of the dollar could be
                            costly to them by reducing the real value of these reserves.</p>
                        <p>This uncertainty in Japan and elsewhere makes countries reluctant to
                            reach agreements with us on other economic and political issues until
                            they can see the overall situation more clearly.</p>
                        <p>There are many reasons for the weakness of the dollar. These include our
                            persistent and growing balance-of-payments deficits; the fact that our
                            trade account has moved into deficit, with every indication that this
                            deficit will grow; our gold stock is diminishing; respectable voices in
                            the financial community and in academia are asserting with <pb n="461"
                                xml:id="pg_461" facs="0489"/>some vehemence that the dollar is
                            overvalued and that this situation should be corrected; there was a
                            report last week by a subcommittee of the Joint Economic Committee,
                            chaired by Congressman <persName corresp="#p_RHS1">Henry
                                Reuss</persName>, which advocated the devaluation of the
                                dollar.<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2">See <ref target="#d164">Document

                            continuing does not help.</p>
                        <p>Most observers expect us to do something, and foreign governments and
                            private traders are now behaving under the assumption that we will do
                            something; this heightens the speculative fever.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">What Can We Do?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The classic remedies for persistent balance-of-payments deficits are
                            either devaluation of one’s currency and/or slowing down internal
                            economic activity. A devaluation makes imports more expensive and
                            exports more lucrative, thus helping to shift output from internal to
                            external markets. Deflation, by reducing demand pressure, works in much
                            the same way. Because of the central role of the dollar as the currency
                            to which most other currencies are pegged, we have always felt that
                            devaluation of the dollar was not a proper course. We have tried
                            deflation over the past several years but it has not worked. We have had
                            the worst of all worlds, a sluggish economy with more inflation than
                            desirable, and a growing balance-of-payments deficit. It is this
                            demonstration that past policy has not accomplished its
                            balance-of-payments function that heightens the present unease.</p>
                        <p>The President, for political as well as technical reasons, may be
                            reluctant to devalue the dollar, despite the fact that we are getting
                            such advice from many in Europe and at home. The dollar could be
                            devalued by raising the price of gold (which would require Congressional
                            approval) only if other countries consented not to similarly raise the
                            price of gold in relation to their currencies; that is, the
                            relationships among currencies would thus be altered. We also could
                            devalue by closing the facility which permits foreign central banks to
                            convert their dollar holdings into gold at $35 an ounce, if other
                            countries then permitted the dollar to float vis-à-vis their currencies
                            until it found a new devalued level, or if we then devalued outright.
                            This is essentially what Congressman Reuss advocated. Since other
                            countries would have to consent to letting the dollar depreciate with
                            respect to their currencies, a dollar devaluation would require some
                            advance negotiation among the major countries.</p>
                        <p>If other major currencies revalued upwards in relation to the dollar,
                            such as Switzerland and Austria recently did, and which Germany and
                            Canada and the Netherlands are in fact doing through their present <pb
                                n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0490"/>floats, this in effect means
                            devaluation of the dollar. The one important currency that all agree is
                            now undervalued is the Japanese yen. One major problem with revaluations
                            by others is that we leave the initiative to them, and in the case of
                            the Japanese are put in the position of demandeur.</p>
                        <p>In addition, changes in currency relationships operate effectively only
                            with time lags so that the impact on our balance of payments might take
                            some time, perhaps even a year or so, to work itself out.</p>
                        <p>Another set of possible correctives would be to change only the prices of
                            imports and exports, which in effect would be a devaluation of the
                            dollar only on trade account, rather than across-the-board, to include
                            as well such things as tourism and capital transfers, in which our
                            accounts also are in deficit. Under the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss>, countries in balance-of-payments difficulties are
                            authorized to impose quotas on their imports. However, this requires
                            complicated administrative machinery to institute. Quotas also operate
                            through controls rather than through the marketplace. For these reasons,
                            in recent years countries which have taken trade actions have preferred
                            not to use quotas.</p>
                        <p>One trade technique now under intensive examination, and which Wilbur
                            Mills and the Williams Commission have advocated, is to impose a
                            surcharge on all imports of an amount sufficient to have a significant
                            effect in diminishing imports. The surcharge would raise the price of
                            imports, and thus operate here the way a devaluation would. The trade
                            impact could be even more powerful if we were also to give a subsidy to
                            exports as an initiative to encourage these. I use the word “could”
                            since other countries could take action to offset the effect of an
                            export subsidy. The combination of import surcharges/export subsidies
                            could have a powerful trade effect if it were large enough, say of about
                            15 percent. The budgetary cost of the export subsidies (say 15% of about
                            $40 billion of exports, or $6 billion a year) could be met mostly by the
                            extra revenue raised from the import surcharges. The two need not go
                            together, and indeed there is much more international experience with
                            import surcharges, but the two in tandem on all imports and exports are
                            more powerful than either alone. We expect that were the United States
                            to impose a surcharge this would be understood by most important foreign
                            countries despite its lack of explicit <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss> sanction; an export subsidy would be more
                            controversial. A subsidy/surcharge system also could have a stimulative
                            domestic psychological impact.</p>
                        <p>I will not go into the complex detail here on how surcharges or subsidies
                            might work administratively. We would have to make clear that these
                            trade actions were intended to be temporary until the situation was
                            corrected, and that the rate of surcharge/subsidy would decline <pb
                                n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0491"/>over time. These assurances
                            would not be easy to accomplish legislatively. The initial rate would
                            have to be sufficiently large to convince the world that it would work.
                            We think such trade action on our part would be credible only if it were
                            accompanied by further domestic measures to cope with inflation; these
                            might include some policy on prices and wages.</p>
                        <p>Action only on trade account would maintain what others would consider to
                            be an overvalued dollar for capital movements, and this certainly would
                            lead to criticism by others that it permits U.S. investors to buy up
                            foreign enterprises cheaply.</p>

                                haphazard basis. Much more significant than this, however, is the
                                danger that the speculation against the dollar will continue and
                                perhaps accelerate, and the Europeans and Japan could force us to
                                take action by demanding that we exchange the dollars they are
                                getting for other reserve assets, such as our declining gold
                                stock.</item>
                            <item>The second choice is to alter exchange rate relationships, either
                                by devaluation of the dollar, or upward revaluation by others
                                (particularly the yen), or most likely a combination of these. Any
                                effective U.S. devaluation would require consent of others.</item>
                            <item>The third choice is some partial action, such as dealing primarily
                                with the trade account. (In the past we have taken partial actions
                                to limit capital outflow, such as our foreign direct investment
                                controls, and theoretically capital controls could be further
                                tightened. We doubt that the President would wish to do this.) Many
                                would interpret trade measures as a precursor to dollar
                                devaluation.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>Throughout 1971 there has been an erosion of European confidence in the
                            stability of the dollar. This has worsened since May, as it became
                            apparent that the U.S. inflation was not being contained, that wage
                            settlements in this country were extremely high, and that the U.S.
                            balance of payments deficit was worsening. The latter is extremely
                            important. Under the present system central banks of other governments
                            purchase dollars when an over-supply of dollars causes the value of the
                            dollar to drop below a given point, i.e. Britain will, if the value of
                            the dollar falls below a specified point, buy up excess dollars and
                            thereby raise the price of the dollar to within one percent of its
                            established parity vis-à-vis the Pound. Thus European central banks have
                            been taking in large <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0493"/>amounts of
                            dollars in order to keep the value of the dollar from falling vis-à-vis
                            their own currencies. However, because Pounds, Marks, etc. must be spent
                            by the central banks in order to purchase these dollars, the money
                            supply of the major European countries has increased significantly, and
                            severe inflationary pressures have resulted.</p>
                        <p>The crisis of this spring came when on May 3 and 4 alone, about $1
                            billion flowed into Germany and greater amounts were expected to follow.
                            The Germans were thus forced to close their foreign exchange market and,
                            on May 10 they floated the D-Mark., i.e. the Bundesbank did not purchase
                            dollars when the price of the dollar fell and thereby allowed the value
                            of the dollar to fall still further vis-à-vis the value of the Mark.
                            Thus, because individuals wished to rid themselves of dollars and
                            purchase Marks, the value of the Mark increased vis-à-vis the dollar and
                            is now approximately seven percent above its value at the close of
                            April. Other European countries have been forced to hold large amounts
                            of unwanted dollars which they are legally entitled to demand that the
                            U.S. redeem in gold.</p>

                        <p>Last week, with no end to the U.S. inflationary and balance of payments
                            problem in sight, there was another rush by speculators to sell dollars
                            for European currencies. Then, on Saturday, <persName corresp="#p_RHS1"
                                >Henry Reuss</persName>, Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee on
                            Exchange and Payments, released a report which: <list>
                                <item>—suggested that the dollar was overvalued and should be
                                    allowed to “float” downward in value;</item>
                                <item>—criticized the Treasury for doing too little to correct the
                                    balance of payments deficit (which could amount to $7 or $8
                                    billion this year as compared to $3 billion last year).</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>On Monday, August 9-with confidence in the stability of the dollar
                            further eroded by this publication—the sale of dollars increased and the
                            value of dollars decreased (i. e., holders of dollars used them to
                            purchase Pounds, D-Marks, Swiss francs, etc. because they felt these
                            currencies would either be revalued or the dollar would be devalued in
                            the near future). The dollar fell to its lowest point vis-à-vis D-Marks
                            since World War II. On the same day the Treasury stated that the Reuss
                            report did not represent Congressional views on the subject and pointed
                            out that the reduction in the balance of payments deficit depends not on
                            modified exchange rates but on a healthy and non-inflationary domestic
                            economy.</p>
                        <p>On Wednesday, August 11, speculation against the dollar abated
                            somewhat—one reason being that the central banks of France and
                            Switzerland instituted measures to prevent domestic banks from
                            purchasing <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0494"/>speculative dollars.
                            However, on Thursday over $1 billion were again forced on European
                            central banks.</p>
                        <p>There is little likelihood that the situation will work itself out
                            without either a revaluation of European currencies (which is the most
                            probable course of action for the Europeans, given the present crisis);
                            a devaluation of the dollar; or U.S. measures to restrict the imports of
                            foreign goods to this country and encourage U. S. exports (which will
                            take legislation). There will also probably be strong efforts on the
                            part of the Europeans to restrict the amounts of dollars held by their
                            central banks and to apply other stringent measures against the
                            dollar.</p>

                            Plan Background, Camp David 8/13-15/71). During an April 8, 1998,
                            interview with the editor, Stein confirmed that there were no options
                            papers for the Camp David meeting, but added that some aspects of the
                            program had been worked on earlier in the year. Stein said that in
                            response to Congressional interest in a wage price freeze, some thinking
                            on modalities had been done at the Council of Economic Advisers, and he
                            thought the <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0495"/>Office of
                            Management and Budget had worked on the issue as well. At Treasury,
                            considerable thought had also been given to the international
                            dimensions. See, for example, <ref target="#d152">Documents 152</ref>
                            and <ref target="#d153">153</ref>.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State and the National Security Council were not
                            represented at the Camp David meeting and, according to memoranda to

                            began. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>’s memoir
                            corroborates this: “a decision of major foreign policy importance had
                            been taken about which neither the Secretary of State nor the national
                            security adviser had been consulted.” (<hi rend="italic">White House

                            planning meeting which lasted for nearly 4 hours that afternoon, as well

                            regime of wage and price controls and established the administrative
                            machinery for their monitoring and enforcement; on the international
                            side the NEP imposed a 10 percent import surtax on all dutiable imports
                            from most-favored-nation countries, suspended the dollar’s
                            convertibility to gold, and reduced foreign assistance expenditures by
                            10 percent. During the April 8, 1998, interview, Stein indicated he
                            thought it was unclear to attendees at the Camp David meeting if closing
                            the gold window implied a floating of the dollar. He said that at Camp
                            David there was no discussion of what outcome was sought in the
                            international economic policy arena and that in the absence of
                            representatives from the State Department and the National Security
                            Council there was little consideration of international political
                            implications.</p>

                        <p>“Dear Mr. Chancellor:</p>
                        <p>I am tonight announcing a comprehensive program to curb inflation,
                            increase employment, restore strength and confidence in the United
                            States dollar, and improve the international monetary system. This major
                            action is necessary to preserve confidence in the dollar and to maintain
                            an international monetary system which will serve the world’s needs. It
                            was our responsibility to act and we have done so.</p>
                        <p>I am imposing a 90-day freeze on wages and prices in the United States. I
                            am cutting certain taxes to stimulate consumption and employment and I
                            am sharply curtailing US Government expenditures. I am also levying
                            temporary surcharge on all dutiable imports not already subject to
                            quantitative limitations by the United States, and I have directed that
                            the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets be
                            suspended.</p>
                        <p>I recognize that these actions will be of concern to Germany as they are
                            vital to us.</p>
                        <p>What we need now is an early agreement on improvements in the
                            international monetary and trading system. I have asked Treasury
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> immediately
                            to get in touch with your Finance Minister to consult on how we can
                            bring about these improvements.</p>
                        <p>I am sure you will find that what we have done will contribute to
                            economic expansion in a world at peace.</p>
                        <p>I look forward to continuing to work with you on these matters of such
                            concern to both of our countries as well as to the rest of the world.

                        </list>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said he had suggested
                            the meeting because he thought it would be a good idea to get together
                            promptly, to explain the reasoning behind the President’s new economic
                            program and hear any initial reactions of other participants. He had not
                            come for the purpose of negotiations and one question to be considered
                            was what kind of negotiating group would be appropriate when it was time
                            for negotiations. The U.S. did not presently have a fixed view on that
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> explained the
                            reasoning behind the President’s program. Everyone was familiar with the
                            domestic background in the U.S. of excessive unemployment and an
                            expansion which was proceeding but not with great speed. There was
                            considerable pessimism about the strength of the expansion and bad
                            psychology had developed about the inflation problem. Our progress on
                            both the inflation and unemployment problems had been disappointing, and
                            some measures which seemed to help on one of those problems hurt on the
                            other. On top of this domestic situation, there was a difficult external
                            problem. There had been a persistent erosion in the U.S. external
                            position since the mid-1960’s and this had been aggravated by two
                            factors. First, our trade position had moved into considerable deficit
                            in the second quarter, and even if the second quarter figures
                            exaggerated the difficulty, the trade position was far from
                            satisfactory. Secondly, protectionist pressures had increased in the
                            past two years, and some had pointed to the difficult external situation
                            as an excuse and justification for protectionist moves. We had been
                            conscious of all these problems for some time but our concern had
                            intensified in recent months. Thought had been given to various
                            measures, particularly on the domestic side, for some time. The
                            situation over the past couple of weeks had brought several of these
                            problems into a single focus. The President had decided not to act in a
                            piecemeal fashion dealing with each of these various problems but to
                            adopt a comprehensive and integrated program. The most controversial
                            measure was the convertibility decision. That decision was taken with
                            the full knowledge of the President that one could not fully predict all
                            the results and implications for the future. The President came to the
                            conviction that now was the time to face the convertibility problem
                            since if it were not faced now, it would have to be faced at another and
                            perhaps more difficult time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said he was impressed
                            by the headlines in two adjoining articles which he had seen in this
                            morning’s <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> which expressed very clearly the
                            U.S. situation as he saw it. The first was that “it was time for the
                            U.S. to face facts,” and the second was that “the U.S. needs growth and
                            competitiveness.” He could not improve on those two headlines as a theme
                            for his view of the present situation.</p>
                        <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0499"/>
                        <p>Discussing the components of the program, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1"
                                >Volcker</persName> said that the President had decided to go all
                            the way on wage-price policy and establish a freeze. Even though the
                            freeze was only for ninety days, it would have a psychological shock
                            effect while the follow-on program was set up. The President had taken a
                            few selective revenue measures which would spur the economy both now and
                            in the long run. All three of the proposed tax cuts required legislative
                            action, but the prospects for that action were good. On the expenditure
                            side, the President had taken some measures which were politically very
                            difficult in deferring his revenue sharing and welfare programs. These
                            were his two prize domestic programs. While the tax and expenditure
                            actions balanced in amount, the stimulation from the tax cuts would be
                            greater than the drag from the expenditure changes.</p>
                        <p>On the external side, the Administration had felt that the strong
                            domestic measures included in the new program alone would have stopped
                            the speculation of the past couple of weeks. But the President had
                            looked beyond the next few weeks or months and had decided to go ahead
                            with the convertibility decision, which he felt would release some of
                            the inhibitions and free the world’s hands to deal with matters of
                            exchange rates and the monetary system, without such concern about
                            speculation. It had been very difficult even to consider possible
                            measures for reform of the monetary system when the possibilities of
                            speculation were so great, and our move should remove some of these
                            inhibitions.</p>
                        <p>On the surcharge, the Trade Expansion Act had been used for the authority
                            since the President wanted to act by executive action rather than
                            legislation. While it would not be difficult to get Congress to
                            authorize a surcharge, it would be very difficult to get authority to
                            end the surcharge when the time came.</p>
                        <p>On the international monetary system, all were conscious of the desire to
                            restore a sustainable stable system. The U.S. had not spelled out any
                            program in the President’s message or elsewhere. The U.S., at this
                            stage, had no program which it was going to spring on anyone. The
                            background material explaining our new program said that some changes in
                            exchange rates might take place and might be helpful to stable
                            functioning of the system. From the U.S. point of view, after years of
                            erosion, we wanted a fundamental strengthening of our position. We had
                            balance-of-payments deficits for a number of years and a declining trade
                            position for a number of years, and we would not be satisfied without a
                            reform that could repair the erosion which had taken place in the U.S.
                            position over the years. We did not want a short-run solution that would
                            deal with the immediate market situation but not lead to long-term
                            improvement. We want to restore stability to the system for a period of
                            years. If we did not get a lasting solution, the problems would simply
                            reappear in a month or six months or a year.</p>
                        <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0500"/>
                        <p>The President had instructed us to put clearly in our explanatory
                            documents that there would be no change in the price of gold. We were
                            aware that in the very immediate market sense, a change in the price of
                            gold might temporarily restore exchange market equilibrium. But we were
                            firmly opposed to that solution for three reasons, any one of which was
                            sufficient to assure our opposition to the move: first, there was a
                            political inhibition to such action in that some legislative action
                            would be required. Second, even if there were no political problem we
                            were opposed because what might look like a quick and easy solution
                            would leave one vulnerable to the same problems in three months or six
                            months or a year. Third, the world had been on a course of evolution
                            which had gradually reduced the importance of gold in the system over
                            the years and we were not going to move in the opposite direction of
                            moving toward rebuilding a system based on gold. Although some argue
                            that changing the price of gold is a clean and quick solution which
                            would stabilize the system over night, that view did not prevail with
                            us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said investment
                            restraints would remain in effect but their future disposition would be
                            under review. Certain of the programs were crumbling. They were adopted
                            as emergency measures and not expected to be sustained for a long
                            period. Bills recently passed in Congress would decimate certain parts
                            of the program. We don’t like such restraints philosophically, and we
                            would be reviewing this whole question.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Schoellhorn</persName> asked whether there
                            had been any decisions on monetary policy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said the discount rate
                            had not even been discussed at Camp David. Since the President was
                            announcing a freeze, he would not want to flaunt this by raising
                            interest rates.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_DJD2">Daane</persName> said that Chairman
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName> fully supported the new
                            program. On monetary policy the money supply had been growing more
                            rapidly than we would like but the latest figures indicated progress in
                            getting it under better control.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName> said he was impressed
                            at the comprehensiveness of the program. He was concerned about
                            reopening foreign exchange markets on a credible basis. The markets
                            could not be reopened at present parities without large movements of
                            dollars and the credibility of the fixed parity system would be in
                            doubt. Also markets could not be kept closed for a long time. Although
                            Germany was not tied to a parity at this time, the Japanese had
                            apparently taken in $700 million today and the Swiss had taken in a
                            large amount last week. How could those countries reopen on the old
                            parity system without floods of dollars? Would it be possible to reopen
                            the markets without changes in parities? Could we envisage these parity
                            changes would come about in the next few days?</p>
                        <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0501"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Neale</persName> asked what sort of changes were going to
                            be required if the U.S. was to be free of its deficits? He agreed with
                            the importance of building a lasting system but said this was a big
                            agenda which went beyond the three or four days which markets could be
                            kept closed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said he had not come
                            for the purpose of trying to negotiate changes in parities. We had
                            worded our statement as mildly as possible to avoid prejudicing any more
                            than necessary the position of other countries. It would not be credible
                            for the U.S. to say there would be no changes in parity. In the end our
                            view is that after years of deficits, the U.S. is entitled to run
                                surpluses.<note n="2" xml:id="d170fn2">See <ref target="#d76"
                                    >Document 76</ref>, which sets out the U.S. balance-of-payments
                                objectives adopted in September.</note> Our aim is to establish the
                            conditions to run such surpluses. Apart from that basic proposition we
                            were not going to say that one parity should change by this amount and
                            another parity by that amount. The basic dilemma was with the entire
                            system. We must repair the erosion that had taken place over a period of
                            years in the U.S. position. Beyond that we did not want to prejudice
                            what changes must be made. This quickly got into the question of what
                            was the proper negotiating forum. He had talked to Schweitzer before
                            leaving Washington. We made clear we did not want a new Bretton Woods
                            conference. One potential group for negotiation was the Group of Ten.
                            This had some defect in that there was no <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss> participation and it was a little bit large but it
                            certainly was a possible forum. He did not think the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Board was a possible forum since the
                            Executive Directors in many cases did not have sufficient authority of
                            their governments and there was probably too much <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss> representation for this kind of
                            negotiation. We would like to keep the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> in the center as much as possible and perhaps one
                            possibility would be a special committee of governors. The U.S. had no
                            fixed view at this time on the question of the negotiating forum, but
                            would like to know what others thought. Perhaps some ad hoc arrangements
                            would be best.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said that if the
                            others present thought it was a good idea Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> would be receptive to
                            inviting their Ministers to go to the U.S. and to talk these matters
                            over during the coming weekend (August 21-22). Certainly we did not say
                            that the problem could necessarily be resolved by the half dozen main
                            countries in brief informal discussions but if there was a strong
                            consensus that such a meeting would be useful, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> would be prepared to host
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Schoellhorn</persName> thanked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> for the elaboration
                            of the U.S. views. He could give only a personal reaction since there
                            had been only a few hours to think about the U.S. moves. On the wage
                            price freeze, he thought the U.S. might find that 90 days may not be
                            sufficient. The experience in Europe had been that it takes a longer
                            time. He noted that <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0502"/>monetary
                            policy had apparently not been revised in a way which would increase
                            U.S. interest rates and impede the flow of funds. Perhaps the most
                            serious measure announced was the 10 percent surcharge. Germany had had
                            a revaluation in excess of 7 percent and now an additional 10 percent
                            resulting from the U.S. surcharge added up to a large amount. Germany
                            already had strong pressures from German exporters for some form of
                            export program, and these pressures would now become irresistible. Also
                            it would be most difficult to find any willingness of countries to
                            revalue their currencies as long as the U.S. 10 percent surcharge
                            existed. And there might not be any positive proposal about what to do
                            with the monetary system as long as there was the surcharge. The
                            position of the dollar as a key currency was now unclear. When markets
                            were reopened, the U.S. program might stop speculation but there were
                            many dollars floating around and there could be many unquiet weeks. He
                            wondered what would be decided in Washington at the September <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> meeting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> asked whether any
                            markets were open at the present time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName> said no markets were
                            open in Europe. However, it would not be possible to keep the German
                            markets closed for more than about three days unless there were going to
                            be some major changes to announce.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName>Ossola</persName> said that it might be possible to keep
                            the Italian market closed for about four days.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said there was no
                            intention to keep the New York market closed for any extended period,
                            but if one of the governments represented at the meeting felt that a day
                            or two closing of the New York market would be essential to their
                            decision making, we would ask that trading in New York cease for a day
                            or two.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName>Ossola</persName> said that the urgent problem in Italy was
                            tourism. Italy had a free market for bank notes and banks were buying
                            dollars at 600 lire to $1. He asked whether Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> was content to let the market
                            set that bank note rate. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1"
                                >Volcker</persName> indicated that he did not see the Italian bank
                            note rate as a particular problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ3">Morse</persName> said he was surprised at
                            the timetable. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> seemed
                            to envisage a period of weeks or months before a return to fixed parity.
                            He thought the danger was that if there was no agreement within a week
                            or so there would be a situation of general floating of all currencies,
                            from which it would be very difficult to get back to a fixed parity
                            system.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said there was a
                            credibility problem which began with the devaluation of sterling and
                            other currency changes. Markets could no longer be convinced that
                            exchange rates would not be changed. In some cases <pb n="475"
                                xml:id="pg_475" facs="0503"/>letting the markets tell us what would
                            be a credible rate might not be entirely bad. If all the questions could
                            be resolved soon that was fine, but we did not want to be jumping from
                            one financial crisis to another. We should not come out with an
                            announcement that we had created a system as follows, and then six
                            months later have it collapse.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Kirbyshire</persName> said it would be difficult for the
                            markets to show what the proper rates were since there were many dollars
                            floating around.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said there were
                            tremendous problems of the monetary system and these questions were not
                            going to be decided in a short-run time. A sustainable system implied a
                            sizable change in the U.S. position. The U.S. position had been both
                            weak and eroding.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ3">Morse</persName> asked whether there was a
                            pattern of exchange rate changes which would be sufficient in <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>’s mind to make the system a
                            credible one within a short period of time so that the U.S. would reopen
                            the gold window, or was there no such pattern.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said he had no little
                            piece of paper in his pocket about what rate changes were needed. He
                            recognized that it was conceivable that credibility in the immediate
                            market might be temporarily restored by small revaluations by certain
                            countries and by the U.S. domestic program, but would it make sense to
                            restore convertibility in the same way we had it. The U.S. needed to
                            reverse the long-term erosion in its position. Other countries might
                            have other issues which they felt should also be considered, and these
                            also should be on the table.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName> said this resolution
                            of all these problems might take a year or two.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said that the basic
                            condition was the system would have to be sustainable.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName> asked what the U.S.
                            would do to maintain the parity of the dollar. Would we maintain parity
                            in the same way as most other countries, e.g., market intervention.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said we would not do
                            so immediately. We would be in the same position as Germany or Canada
                            already was in.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName> reiterated the
                            importance of the 10 percent surcharge. He asked how long was
                            “temporary” and whether there was a connection between the surtax and
                            the restoration of a credible system.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said the elimination
                            of the surcharge did not depend on the restoration of the system. We
                            needed to restore a strong U.S. position and the surcharge would go off
                            as soon as we made the judgment that our position was the one we were
                            seeking.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Schoellhorn</persName> said every
                            government would be reluctant to revalue because of the surcharge. Even
                            though the overall percentage of total <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476"
                                facs="0504"/>German exports covered might not be so large, the
                            surcharge would be very important in particular industries and regions
                            in Germany.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said the problem of
                            particular industries and regions was precisely the one the U.S. had had
                            in its problems with protectionist pressures and had to be resisted
                            aggressively. The surcharge was one action the U.S. could take
                            unilaterally toward getting a strong position. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName> said there was a danger that we
                            would be building the surcharge permanently into the system.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> agreed that was a
                            danger if the surcharge lasted too long. The President wanted to utilize
                            his present authority to apply the surtax rather than seek new
                            legislative authority in order to reduce the danger that the surcharge
                            would be kept on too long.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName>Ossola</persName> said he shared Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ1">Schoellhorn</persName>’s views about the surcharge.
                            He could understand the closing of the gold window as a measure, and he
                            could understand the application of the surcharge as a measure, but he
                            could not understand both since they seemed contradictory and countries
                            might not move on the exchange rate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said it was a sort of
                            simultaneous equation. It was not clear that some countries would want
                            to move on the exchange rate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ3">Morse</persName> said Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said the surcharge would be
                            removed when the U.S. got a strong position and asked what that
                            meant.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said the U.S. should
                            have a period of surplus. We have had an extended period of basic
                            deficits and we needed a period of surpluses. In addition there were
                            questions of financing the defense shield and some trading arrangements
                            and obstacles around the world which must be dealt with as well. One
                            example was the agricultural arrangements in Europe which caused
                            problems for the U.S. Agriculture was not the only problem. There were
                            many outstanding issues of that sort on which we would like to work and
                            see progress in developing the framework within which the U.S. could
                            develop a strong balance of payments.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Schoellhorn</persName> said our
                            governments did not know what was required to get rid of the surcharge.
                            He asked whether there was any relationship to the non-tariff barrier
                            discussions which were going on.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said it would not
                            depend on those discussions.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_DJD2">Daane</persName> said we were not
                            looking at adjustment just for the short run but one that was
                            sustainable for a long period of time.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Schoellhorn</persName> asked what we would
                            do if others introduced surcharges.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said that we had been
                            told for many years that the U.S. had a balance-of-payments emergency.
                            We had a long period of deficits. No other country was in that
                            position.</p>
                        <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0505"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName> said all countries
                            were interested in the restoration of strength of the dollar. They had
                            found out that difficulty for the dollar meant difficulty for their own
                            currencies and they understood that the monetary system could only be
                            based on a common position. He was concerned about the immediate problem
                            of how to reopen exchange markets on a credible basis that would not
                            require first one country and then another to take measures to protect
                            itself. We were all in a position of interdependence. The dollar
                            position must be credible and the position of other currencies must be
                            credible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Neale</persName> referred to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>’s discussion of a possible
                            meeting of ministers in Washington. He said there should not be a
                            meeting until we knew where we were going. There had to be preparations.
                            It would be tragic if a meeting were held and nothing happened.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said the meeting he
                            had suggested would not be designed to settle all problems necessarily
                            though if problems could be solved that would be fine. He did not agree
                            with Mr. <persName>Neale</persName> that we could not have a small and
                            informal meeting of the kind he had envisaged. If we couldn’t even meet
                            on these problems because we think the problems are too difficult, we
                            may never get them resolved. We in the U.S. have thought that one
                            advantage of biting the bullet and suspending convertibility was that it
                            would eliminate some of the inhibition and we would be freer to talk
                            about the problems and try to solve them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ3">Morse</persName> said from the technical
                            viewpoint he would expect to open the market on Thursday unless there
                            was clearly something to expect very soon. If markets were reopened now,
                            there was no chance that the old parity would be credible. He thought
                            there was a grand prize in getting quick agreement to avoid that
                            situation. He hoped the U.S. would want a quick solution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said we would want a
                            quick solution consistent with the premise within which we operate of
                            needing a world-wide framework within which a sufficient strengthening
                            of the U.S. position can take place.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ3">Morse</persName> said the U.S. needed an
                            effective and sizable devaluation relative to other currencies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said he should make
                            clear he had no authority to negotiate exchange rate changes and no
                            intention of trying to do so.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Schoellhorn</persName> said he was in the
                            same position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Neale</persName> said the representatives other than the
                            U.S. may want to talk among themselves about these matters.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said they were welcome
                            to remain in the meeting room as long as they wished for any further
                            discussion.</p>
                        <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0506"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Iyami</persName> said the Tokyo market had been the only
                            one open on Monday and the banks had bought $700 million. However, there
                            was no inflow from abroad and the $700 million was purchased from local
                            people and banks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ3">Morse</persName> said no answer could be
                            given to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>’s offer of a
                            meeting in Washington until after the Monetary Committee meeting on
                            Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said he did not have
                            in mind a grand and formal ministerial meeting with fixed agenda and
                            large staff. It might be helpful in permitting Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> to express his views directly
                            and get the views of others directly. If this would help resolve the
                            issue that would be excellent, but we should not make any promise that
                            such a meeting would resolve the issues.</p>
                        <p>(The U.S. representatives left and the others remained for further

                                monetary issues and the facts that Italy at that time chaired the

                            wondered whether the U.S. would completely refrain from intervention in
                            the exchange markets. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>
                            said normally we would not intervene, although there might be
                            exceptional circumstances which he could not anticipate which might
                            require intervention. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName>
                            asked what the difference was between the present dollar float and the
                            Canadian float. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said
                            that in the legal sense our position was the same as the Canadian and
                            the German, but the legal similarity did not mean very much. Basically,
                            the U.S. had not changed the parity of the dollar. Others would make
                            that decision; we could not. We did not assume that there would be no
                            changes in parities. We simply didn’t know in which direction the dollar
                            would move. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> asked
                            whether we would request an exception from our obligation <pb n="480"

                                >IMF</gloss> to limit changes in parity to 1 percent. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> replied that the legal
                            situation was difficult. The question is, who would be failing to
                            fulfill his obligations—the U.S. or the other countries? To repeat, we
                            don’t intend to intervene in the exchange market and, in that sense, our
                            position is the same as the Canadians’ and the Germans’.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> said that Canadians and
                            the Germans had said that they were floating for a limited time and that
                            the U.S. had not said this. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1"
                                >Volcker</persName> on the contrary replied that, we had said that
                            our action was for a limited time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1"
                                >Volcker</persName> then briefly reviewed the philosophy outlined in
                            the President’s three-part program. He noted that the decision on
                            suspending convertibility of the dollar was not in the original scenario
                            but had been added because of the way the exchange markets were behaving
                            in August. He said the U.S. appreciated what the French had been trying
                            to do during that period. They had been very helpful in their efforts to
                            deal with the problem of speculation. Other countries had been more
                            nervous, however, so we had had to go ahead. In fact, if the Germans
                            hadn’t begun selling dollars this summer, he wouldn’t be here now. As
                            for how long it would last, the U.S. first must move decisively toward a
                            strong external position after years of weakness and reestablish
                            confidence in the dollar in some lasting form. Before we could terminate
                            our measures, we had to be satisfied that the adjustment in the position
                            of the dollar (i.e., the restoration of balance-of-payments surpluses)
                            was assured. The burden of adjustment would lie less on Europe than on
                            Canada and Japan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> referred to our
                            decisions to suspend convertibility of the dollar into gold. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> reminded him that
                            this included other assets as well, including <gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                                >SDR</gloss>’s. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName>
                            asked why <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>’s were included. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> replied that we had
                            to protect ourselves against total obligations against our gold stock.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> said we would not be
                            able to adhere to this position very long. We would soon have to be
                            discussing further <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> allocation. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> repeated that the
                            question of how long the dollar would continue floating depended on the
                            actions of the other countries.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> asked whether we still
                            adhered to the basic principle of the Bretton Woods system, namely,
                            fixed parities. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said,
                            broadly speaking, “yes,” but the United States must reestablish a strong
                            external position. Moreover, the system itself needed improvement. It
                            had been subject to recurrent crises. We should take advantage of our
                            present opportunity to reshape the system so that it could serve for the
                            next twenty-five years. He was not advocating an international monetary
                            conference at this time and not saying that we would continue the
                            suspension of convertibility until the system had been reshaped. The
                            ending of the suspension of convertibility would depend instead on the
                                <pb n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0509"/>recovery of the dollar’s
                            strength. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said we had
                            no plans to propose for reshaping the system. We wanted to hear the
                            views of the other countries so that we could reach a consensus.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> said that, because of
                            our measures, daily life in the monetary system would be different now.
                            Sixty to sixty-five percent of the world’s currency transactions would
                            now be floating. He feared that we were in effect moving from a system
                            of fixed parities to one of floating parities. What made the U.S. think
                            that we could go back to a system of parities? Nations would accept the
                            new situation and take whatever measures, such as border taxes, as were
                            necessary to protect themselves. France was concerned that everything
                            that the U.S. had achieved over the past twenty-five years in terms of
                            monetary stability and free convertibility would be lost. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> replied that we equally
                            recognized this danger, but there was an even greater danger of growing
                            protectionism in the United States if we had not acted to prevent
                            further erosion of our external position. The President felt that this
                            latter danger was great enough to justify the risks inherent in the
                            measures he had taken.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> said that this was not
                            the vein in which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> had
                            spoken to the group in London yesterday. Yesterday he had said “we’ve
                            made our move, now it is your turn”, and had shown no awareness of the
                            dangers involved. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>
                            replied that, if that was what <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1"
                                >Giscard</persName> had been told, then he had obviously failed to
                            make himself clear. We were certainly aware of the dangers but we didn’t
                            want to patch up another temporary settlement with a 4-5 percent change
                            in parities. We wanted a long-term solution.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> asked what would happen
                            at next month’s <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> meeting. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> replied that we were
                            ready at the appropriate time to go back to a system of fixed rates but
                            with some changes, perhaps along the lines of our proposals on wider
                            bands and temporary floats. He considered our proposal on floats more
                            conservative than the Belgian proposal and more in line with French
                            thinking. We had proposed that there be no float unless there was a
                            fundamental disequilibrium, but our proposals were based on a strong
                            presumption of fixed parities. We obviously could not settle everything
                            at next month’s <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> meeting, but we
                            ought to be thinking hard at that meeting about the direction in which
                            we wanted to go.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> said the French would
                            have to consider what position they should take. It was a real problem.
                            They didn’t like to let the market fix exchange rates. The German
                            experience was an example of how bad this could be. The mark had floated
                            much higher than the Germans had expected. Appreciation had not been 3,
                            4 or 5 percent but 8 to 10 percent. Now the Germans were unhappy. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> replied that they
                            should have thought of that before they acted. If we are to return to
                            fixed parities, we must convince the market that they are
                            sustainable.</p>
                        <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0510"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> said France had warned
                            the Germans they were headed down a dangerous path. He said France
                            feared the current trend toward floating rates would lead to
                            protectionism. If there were no clear determination that the U.S. was
                            prepared, not necessarily to restore the old system in every detail, but
                            at least to retain the principle of fixed parities, then there was a
                            danger that we would go back to the chaos of the 1930’s. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said the President was aware of
                            the unpredictable elements in this program. Before going back to fixed
                            parities, however, we have a sizable adjustment to make in our external
                            position. We can’t solve the problem by little adjustments.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> said that one
                            consequence of our measure would be a reluctance by central banks to
                            hold dollars in the future. This was how the U.S. had financed its
                            deficit during the last ten years. It would have to find a new way of
                            doing this now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>
                            replied that we didn’t want to finance our deficits, we wanted to
                            eliminate them. Giscard said that would take 10 to 18 months and we had
                            to find a way to finance them in the meantime. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said we wouldn’t have to wait
                            that long. Once people were sure that the tide had turned there would be
                            a reflux of short-term dollars. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1"
                                >Giscard</persName> said the market was likely to push the dollar
                            down farther than we wanted. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1"
                                >Volcker</persName> said it might well go down, and maybe it needed
                            to go down. No one could say now how much it would go down. However, the
                            U.S. must have an adjustment. He did not think this adjustment would
                            have a major effect on Europe.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> said jokingly that
                            France had anticipated our program and was selling only luxury goods to
                            the United States. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>
                            said the major effect would be on Japan and Canada. Giscard added “and
                            the Germans.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> replied
                            that German exports did not loom so large in the total picture except
                            for automobiles.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the U.S. proposals to the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"

                            <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> said we had spoken of
                            temporary floats to prepare a change of parity. In the case of the
                            dollar float, were we preparing to move to a new parity or to return to
                            the old one? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> replied
                            that the parity of the dollar was normally expressed in terms of gold.
                            We did not intend changing that parity but that wasn’t the parity that
                            counted. The one that counts is the parity between the dollar and the
                            other currencies. As for the dollar-gold ratio, we believe that small
                            changes in that parity would be destabilizing. They brought about
                            temporary solutions but they created the expectation of further changes
                            the next time the dollar came under pressure and thus provoked
                            speculation. Moreover, the monetary system had been gradually moving off
                            gold. The U.S. wanted this evolution to continue. Possibly the present
                            dependence on the reserve currencies also needed to change. <pb n="483"
                                xml:id="pg_483" facs="0511"/>This was something the U.S. was
                            prepared to look at. Perhaps <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>’s
                            provided a possible future base for the system. For these reasons there
                            was no prospect of a change in the gold-dollar ratio.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> replied that, be that as
                            it may, we could not escape questions. He also asked about the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> obligation of other countries to
                            support the dollar. As a result of our measures, they would be faced by
                            a need to buy immense quantities of dollars to meet this obligation. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> replied that the
                            quantities might not be immense. We were aware of the problem and it had
                            not been easy for us to make the decisions that we had. What other
                            countries would now do he could not say.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> replied that
                            nonetheless, we must think of the problems of people who have believed
                            for years that they must respect the rules and who now realize that, if
                            they continue to respect the rules, they will be creating enormous
                            problems for themselves. Something will have to be done. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said we understood this, but
                                <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> should remember that
                            our action in suspending convertibility was tied to a domestic program.
                            That program was our contribution to restoring the international
                            stability of the dollar. It was the instability of the dollar that had
                            been causing the influx problem that France had been fighting for the
                            past month or so.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> observed that, in the
                            present circumstances, a Group of Ten meeting would probably be useless
                            since there was no possibility of taking common decisions at the present
                            moment. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said we were
                            looking ahead to an extended period of negotiations on possible changes
                            in the system. He asked what <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1"
                                >Giscard</persName> thought of trying to form a new group, perhaps
                            under <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> auspices, possibly with some
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss> representation, though not too
                            much to make it unmanageable, rather than sticking to the Group of
                            Ten.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, he asked whether <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1"
                                >Giscard</persName> thought it would be useful for him and some of
                            the other Finance Ministers to go to Washington to meet with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>. Obviously it was
                            impossible to settle everything in an afternoon, but would such a
                            meeting be useful?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> replied that it was too
                            early to decide either of these questions. The dust had to settle first.
                            The European governments had to devote themselves to practical decisions
                            in the days immediately ahead. He thought it better to let things take
                            their natural shape. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>
                            said this was all right so long as the shape did not turn out to be a
                            bad one. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> said he thought
                            there was no danger of this, at least not right away. Another reason for
                            not convening the Group of Ten was that the Europeans were particularly
                            concerned about the import surcharge, which was not a matter for the
                            Group of Ten.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> also mentioned that in
                            the last few weeks the French had been concerned about the mounting
                            pressures on the dollar and had <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0512"
                            />taken measures to prevent the situation from being aggravated. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> replied that the U.S.
                            was very conscious of this. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1"
                                >Giscard</persName> promised that France would continue to cooperate
                            in the coming days and would refrain from comments which might aggravate
                            the situation.</p>

                        <p>During the week following announcement of the New Economic Policy on
                            August 15, 1971, most foreign exchange markets were closed. Beginning on
                            August 17, over the signature of Executive Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_ETLJ1">Theodore L. Eliot</persName>, Jr., the Department
                            of State sent daily memoranda to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry
                                Kissinger</persName> summarizing foreign reactions to the
                            President’s program, and <persName corresp="#p_HRD1">Hormats</persName>,
                            in turn, summarized developments as he transmitted the memoranda to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. In general, media
                            reaction was highly critical but official reaction centered more on how
                            to cope with the new situation; criticism was directed more at the 10
                            percent import surcharge than at suspension of the dollar’s
                            convertibility to gold. The European Community, at its Ministerial
                            meeting on August 19, was unable to agree on a common approach, but
                            decided that when foreign exchange markets reopened on Monday, August
                            23, each member would adopt its own approach. (National Archives,

                                >Trudeau</persName>, wrote a letter to President <persName

                            objectives for improving the international monetary system, but
                            expressing grave concern over the import surcharge, which he thought
                            would be very damaging to the Canadian economy and the American economy
                            in turn. A Canadian Ministerial delegation, headed by Minister of
                            Finance Benson, was coming to Washington to discuss the program with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>. (Ibid.)
                            Mexican President Echeverria also wrote President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> that he was sending a delegation
                            to Washington to seek exemption from the surcharge. Echeverria’s letter
                            has not been found but is summarized in an August 18 memorandum from
                            Executive Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">Eliot</persName> to

                            the Community’s response. Ambassador Gould asked for guidance on how the
                            administration would like the Community to respond in both the short and
                            long run. (Telegram 467 from Luxembourg, August 20; ibid., <gloss

                                <persName corresp="#p_HRD1">Hormats</persName> reported on an August
                            19 request by the Canadian delegation for an exemption for Canada from
                            the surcharge. <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>
                            reportedly told the Canadians the United States thought it important to
                            have no exemptions, but “for diplomatic reasons did not flatly turn down
                            the request and assured the Canadians that we would consider their
                            problem and that further discussions could take place.” <persName

                            raising the danger of unleashing protectionist forces abroad if others
                            chose to defend themselves against the U.S. actions. He noted that
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Managing Director <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPP2">Schweitzer</persName> had proposed drawing up an

                                corresp="#p_HRD1">Hormats</persName> agreed with the Treasury
                            Department “that a large meeting at this time would probably not be
                            productive” but continued that “if Treasury argues that an <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> paper would be unacceptable, since it
                            might lean toward the European position, Treasury should come up with a
                            similar document which lays out in broad terms what we expect of others
                            and where we hope to come out of this exercise.” In sum, <persName

                            needed to give its trading partners “a clear picture of what we expect
                            from them” and develop an integrated negotiating scenario lest
                            “protectionist forces get out of hand with the serious foreign policy

                            hours August 31 for a lively, but as usual, quite inconclusive exchange
                            of views. Paul obviously enjoyed himself playing games with the rest of
                            us.</p>
                        <p>We began by discussing the August 28 paper on balance of payments
                                equilibrium.<note n="2" xml:id="d173fn2">Not found, but see <ref
                                    target="#d76">Document 76</ref> which is presumably the
                                successor of the August 28 paper.</note> The main issue seemed to be
                            whether this paper, or something like it, should be given to the
                            Deputies of the Group of 10. It was agreed that there was a case for
                            quantifying what we were after—apparently, Paul has previously only said
                            “substantial improvement”—but it was also agreed that this paper would
                            have to be rewritten before it could be passed out. As usual, Paul was
                            left with a free hand to do what he thinks best, but it is possible that
                            he will use the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Working Party 3

                        <p>Paul noted that both the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> and U.S.
                            ideas of equilibrium call for the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>’s
                            to bear a significant part of the adjustment burden!</p>
                        <p>At one point, he introduced into the discussion some estimates of what we
                            are after in “non-monetary areas” recognizing, however, that a large
                            enough monetary adjustment would reduce the pressure to deal with these
                            problems. His list, as I understood it, follows: <list>
                                <item>Multilateral defense offset in Europe—$1-1.5 billion;</item>
                                <item>Canadian trade practices, including auto agreement—$100

                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>There were some pointed remarks about the unlikelihood of accomplishing
                            much on these in negotiations with the Europeans, at least in the short
                            run.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to the August 30 options paper<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d173fn6">Not found.</note> and we went round and round with
                            almost everyone but Paul arguing that these were not the kinds of
                            options that should be put to the President. At the very minimum, we
                            urged that Option 1 be developed to spell out the main elements of a
                            possible new international monetary system, that is, to examine such
                            questions as: <list>
                                <item>Should the dollar remain a reserve currency and, if not, what
                                    should take its place?—i.e., how consolidate a new reserve

                            Meeting in London on September 15 and 16. However, no agreement was
                            reached on what sort of realignments are necessary. There was strong
                            Japanese and European pressure for the United States to devalue the
                            dollar outright—by raising the price of gold—in exchange for revaluation
                            of the yen and major European currencies. Paul Volcker, the U.S.
                            Representative, opposed this and indicated that the Administration is
                            still planning to return to the $35 an ounce gold price, which was
                            suspended on August 15. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>
                            also added that the United States “did not have any particular plan” for
                            solving the present crisis and believed the current phase was one of
                            “consultation, not negotiation”.</p>

                        <p>The present problems, as indicated in previous memos,<note n="4"

                        <p>—Our major trading partners have not been able to agree on coordinated
                            measures to meet the present crisis. This raises the possibility that
                            one country or trade group such as the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> might take actions which we consider acceptable, but we
                            would be unable to remove the surcharge if another country such as Japan
                            failed to take appropriate measures, thus making the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> draw back and strengthening the hands
                            of its domestic protectionist forces in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The longer the surcharge is in effect, the greater the possibility that
                            our trading partners will institute export subsidies, capital controls
                            on the inflow of dollars, or restrictions on the imports of U.S.
                            products. In doing so they would strengthen their bargaining position in
                            future negotiations and improve their economic positions vis-à-vis the
                            U.S.; however, once instituted, such measures are politically difficult
                            to remove, and will lead to a more restrictive trading world rather than
                            the freer trading world which the President desires and which is most
                            certainly in our interest. By the same token, the longer the U.S.
                            surcharge remains in effect the stronger will be the vested interests in
                            this country in retaining it, and the more difficult politically it will
                            be for the President to remove.</p>
                        <p>With this in mind, it is important that you raise the following

                        </p>
                        <p>Since the President’s speech, a number of USG spokesmen have indicated
                            that we would remove the surcharge only after a major exchange
                            revaluation by our trading partners plus a removal of trade barriers and
                            a more “equitable” arrangement for sharing the burden of U.S. troops
                            stationed abroad. It is, however, doubtful that the surcharge is a
                            strong enough or appropriate lever for securing all of these goals.
                            Moreover, as Vice Chairman <persName corresp="#p_EO1"
                                >Emminger</persName> of the Bundesbank has recently indicated, this
                            may prove to be an “indigestible negotiating fare”, at least within the
                            time span within which one would wish to move from the present
                            provisional state of affairs. And continued use of the surcharge runs
                            the risks discussed above.</p>
                        <p>One way of using the surcharge would be to regard it as a lever only for
                            securing appropriate currency revaluations; subsequently, we would use
                            the lack of gold convertibility as a lever for developing a new
                            international monetary system, and negotiate away restrictions on U.S.
                            exports by our trading partners by holding out the possibility of the
                            removal of our own restrictions on imports as a carrot.</p>

                        <p>There is considerable danger that the President will not be given a full
                            range of choice in making the decisions on what sort of monetary system
                            we wish for the future. There has been a “conventional wisdom” that a
                            system of relatively fixed exchange rates allows for greater exchange
                            rate predictability for traders and investors. Floating rates have been
                            regarded purely as a transitional device for use in emergency situations
                            in order to determine the “market rate of exchange” for currencies, and
                            have been relatively unused.</p>
                        <p>Recently, however, we have learned more about floating rates: <list>
                                <item>—Germany and Canada have been floating their currencies for
                                    the last several months. They have neither fluctuated
                                    erratically nor spiraled upward in value as some had predicted.
                                    In addition, they have posed no major problems for traders, who,
                                    with the help of banks which insure traders against changes in
                                    currency value, have shown little sign of discontent with the

                                    exchange rates would, by making exchange rate changes smaller
                                    and more frequent, eliminate most major political crises

                                    countries a devaluation causes a major Governmental crisis; in
                                    Brazil, which devalues by small amounts monthly, it is regarded
                                    as routine. Britain suffers a Government crisis when it
                                    devalues. Germany, before the float, suffered similar crises
                                    when it revalued.).</item>

                                proposed work programs did not give adequate effective and prompt
                                attention to issues of special interest to U.S., such as sharing of
                                defense burden and elimination of unfair trade practices on part of

                        <p>It is agreed by all of us that we do not want a patchwork settlement that
                            would only lead to another financial crisis in a few years. However, it
                            is increasingly apparent that it is not enough to say that we need a $13
                            billion swing in our balance of payments, exchange rate realignment,
                            reform of the monetary system, and more equitable deals on trade and <pb
                                n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0524"/>defense sharing. So far, we
                            have left it to others to adjust to the situation we have created. But
                            soon we will have to clarify what we want multilaterally and what we
                            want bilaterally from key countries. Most feel that having taken the
                            essential but shock-producing moves of August 15, we should be prepared
                            to propose some positive initiatives in the reasonably near future.</p>
                        <p>We need to define more precisely four areas: our objectives, our
                            priorities among them, our negotiating leverage, and our negotiating
                            strategy.</p>

                                <p>In the exchange rate area, we first need to determine whether our
                                    interests are best served by a prolonged float or an early
                                    return to a realigned, fixed rate system. If the latter, we need
                                    precise ideas about how far each major country is prepared to go
                                    in revaluing now, and how far later. What combinations of
                                    revaluations are the minimum acceptable to us at this point in
                                    time?</p>
                                <p>Is some exchange rate action by us needed to assure achievement
                                    of our parity realignment objectives? (Most feel this should
                                    only be considered as part of a long-term basic reform of the
                                    system.)</p>

                            <item>On monetary reform there are many tough interrelated questions.
                                For example, do we or don’t we want to return to fixed parities? In

                                be gradually phased out, along with gold, in favor of <gloss

                                this objective? Over what time frame?</item>

                            <item>Defense is a major drain on our balance of payments. With a big
                                trade surplus it is manageable. But that surplus is at least 18
                                months off. What do we mean by increased defense burden sharing?
                                This might take the form of larger purchases of U.S. equipment by
                                those countries where our expenditures are high (e.g., Germany,
                                Japan). Offset negotiations with Germany are well along.
                                Alternatively, we could try to get direct contributions from NATO as
                                a whole. Do we now want to place greater emphasis on budget
                                contributions as opposed to balance of payments offset purchases?
                                Essentially, we must be more precise about what we want and can get
                                in relation to action on the surcharge and dollar convertibility,
                                what is not feasible in that context, and what may be negotiable

                            <item>What are our specific trade objectives, and with which countries?
                                For example, a change in the Common Agricultural Policy of the <pb
                                    n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0525"/>European Community is one
                                of our high priority objectives. Yet, this is likely to be a
                                long-term negotiation. On the other hand, could we get agreement on
                                stopping any further agricultural price increases? and/or on a
                                longer-term target of moving toward direct European budget support
                                of agricultural subsidies? Others include a reduction or complete
                                removal of the discriminatory aspects of European Community
                                preferential arrangements; a reduction in trade restrictions,
                                including non-tariff barriers by Japan, revising the Canadian
                                automobile agreement, etc. Which of these actions, if any, do we
                                expect to achieve now in exchange for removing the surcharge or
                                otherwise, and which must we carry over for later negotiation? Also,
                                what, if anything, are we willing to put on the negotiating table?
                                Finally, we cannot ignore the less developed countries where there
                                are some special problems.</item>

                        <p>What negotiating instruments are at our disposal, and how much leverage
                            do they give us? Negotiating concessions we can make include: (a)
                            removal of surcharge; (b) reduction of surcharge in stages; (c)
                            restoration of “limited” dollar convertibility into gold, or other
                            reserve assets; (d) restoration of “full” convertibility into gold, or
                            other reserve assets; (e) removal of the “buy American” aspect of the
                            Job Development credit; (f) differential (i. e., for some countries but
                            not others) removal of surcharge, action on job development credit,
                            restoration of convertibility; (g) devaluation of the dollar vis-à-vis
                            gold.</p>
                        <p>We need to be clear about the risks and advantages, domestic and foreign,
                            economic and political, involved in the use or rejection of each option,
                            and the timing involved in each. We need to explore the legality <pb
                                n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0526"/>of undertaking each. We also
                            need a clearer idea of how much leverage each gives us, and what
                            combinations add most to that leverage in general and with which
                            particular countries. With time other countries may learn to live with
                            the surcharge and their resentment may lead to stubborn refusal to give
                            up anything for its removal, or even to retaliation. Domestically, it
                            may become addictive and encourage protectionism, raise costs, weaken
                            our competitiveness, and worsen our problem of inflation.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Up to this point, we have been imprecise about both what we want from
                            others and within what time frames we want it. In addition, if the
                            assessments resulting from the answers to the questions posed above lead
                            us to conclude that we should ask for different actions from different
                            countries, we will have to develop a strategy for making our specific
                            bilateral demands clear-e.g., from Canada, from Japan, from Germany,
                            from Britain-and for the kinds of actions we will take if particular
                            countries either meet or refuse to meet these demands. At some point, we
                            must know when and how to compromise without prejudicing the achievement
                            of those fundamental objectives which are more clearly longer-term than
                            others. Any negotiating strategy must weigh carefully the effect of what
                            we are doing and how we do it on our foreign relations and security
                            policies. For example, it should include the possibility of forthcoming
                            Presidential initiatives at appropriate times.</p>
                        <p>We also need to know the strong points of resistance by others, e.g., the
                                <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> has stated publicly that it will
                            not agree to a major realignment of parities unless the U.S.
                            participates by devaluing. Some other countries may also insist on
                            additional action by us (e.g. eligibility for their exports to qualify
                            under the full Job Development credit) before they will agree either to
                            adequate revaluations, negotiations about monetary reform, defense
                            burden sharing, etc. We need an assessment of how serious these demands
                            are, and the risks and advantages to us involved in acceding or not
                            acceding to them.</p>
                        <p>Finally, we need to decide on a mechanism for carrying out the diverse
                            and multi-faceted negotiations. Most of the issues are Treasury’s main
                            line of responsibility, but our objectives range also into the areas of
                            trade and defense. This will create problems for other governments,
                            whose internal division of responsibility is often quite strict, and
                            will require a suitable mechanism on our part.</p>

                            on their part) about the international monetary situation as reflected

                            billion turnaround, largely on trade, is too ambitious, particularly in
                            the relatively short time frame of a year or two; (2) the general
                            realignment of exchange rates should include US action to devalue the
                            dollar; (3) the US import surcharge should be eliminated; (4) fixed
                            rates should be quickly reestablished. Some countries, notably Italy and
                            Japan, urged improvement in the international monetary system through
                            greater reliance on Special Drawing Rights (<gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                                >SDR</gloss>’s). The Group of Ten will meet again in Washington on
                            September 25 at the Deputy level and September 26 at the Ministerial

                            approach consisting of dividing the issues into three groups to be dealt
                            with in stages: (1) realignment of exchange rates, relationship of
                            currencies to gold, wider margins of fluctuation around par rates, and
                            abolition of the US surcharge; (2) balance of payments adjustment
                            measures other than exchange rates, such as defense burden sharing
                            arrangements, future type of convertibility, and methods for handling
                            flows of capital; (3) the future role of reserve currencies and other
                            questions relating to basic reforms of the international monetary
                            system. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> noted
                            that the United States did not agree with this approach and the placing
                            of issues into separate groups.</p>
                        <p>Governor Wormser of the Bank of France believes that an early settlement
                            of the monetary crisis is essential to avert a worldwide recession and
                            that there are only five or six months to negotiate a long term
                            solution. Otherwise, he believes, the world economic situation will <pb
                                n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0528"/>deteriorate markedly, with
                            increasing national restrictions on trade and payments coming into
                            being, partly in response to the US surcharge.</p>
                        <p>This week’s meeting of the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> Council of
                            Ministers (September 20-21) concluded that there was no need at this
                            time to revise positions on the US economic measures. The French and
                            Germans stressed the dangers of retaliation and no active consideration
                            was given to retaliatory or compensatory measures at this time. The
                            Community intends, however, to watch the evolution of the situation
                            closely in order to adopt “any new decisions which may appear
                            necessary”.</p>
                        <p>Our Embassy reports that large segments of Japan’s business community,
                            especially the trading companies, favor unilateral Japanese action to
                            revalue the yen. The Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance are
                            reported as resisting this pressure on the grounds that Japan should
                            wait for further multilateral movement. Government officials believe any
                            unilateral action to revalue the yen now would be treated by others
                            merely as an opening bid.</p>
                        <p>The dollar weakened further today and the major trading currencies
                            reached their highest levels since the floats began. The Deutschemark
                            rose to nearly 10 percent above par following reported purchases
                            yesterday by the German Central Bank of more than $100 million in the
                            spot and forward markets.</p>

                                    <p>Why have others asked for devaluation of the dollar vis-à-vis
                                        gold? Politically, because such a move would appear to make
                                        the necessary exchange rate adjustments in other countries
                                        more easily tolerable. Also, the bookkeeping effects are
                                        certainly not negligible to some countries. Strategically,
                                        because some, i.e., the French, want to force us back to
                                        convertibility at a higher fixed gold price. The wealth
                                        redistribution effects of a price change are tolerable for
                                        us and others, although not desirable. Politically,
                                        devaluation is difficult for the President, but perhaps not
                                        impossible, and the atmosphere is clearly changing. There is
                                        a practical difficulty due to legislative requirements which
                                        argues for action only in the context of system changes
                                        which also would require Congressional approval but which
                                        would come near the end of the Phase II negotiation rather
                                        than Phase I.</p>

                                <item>Last, but not least, there are issues concerning the
                                    negotiating scenario. How do we coordinate bilateral trade,

                        </list>
                        <p>The meeting of the U.S. delegation was chaired by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>, whose principal concern was
                            with the questions likely to come up in corridor conversations among
                            delegates concerning the new U.S. economic policies. He particularly
                            stressed the danger that the press might be expecting some dramatic
                            solution to the current world monetary crisis to come out of the
                            Bank/Fund meetings, and will report failure when such a solution does
                            not materialize. There is in fact no intention to seek answers to the
                            monetary, trade, and defense burden-sharing issues next week; as always,
                            the Bank/Fund meetings will be largely routine.</p>
                        <p>There will, of course, be side meetings of the Group of Ten, but this is
                            purely incidental to the Bank/Fund meetings. Members of the U.S.
                            delegation were specifically urged to express ignorance if any questions
                            are asked by foreign delegates about the prospects for a resolution to
                            be passed by the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Governors dealing
                            with the international monetary <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0533"
                            />system. (FYI: Such a resolution is expected, but the subject is highly
                            sensitive; the resolution will in any case merely call for studies. End
                            FYI)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> stressed the official
                            U.S. view that the balance of payments problem reflects not merely the
                            need for changes in the international monetary system, but also foreign
                            trade practices which are biased against the United States, and the U.S.
                            defense burden. Fundamental rethinking of these issues is necessary, and
                            while the U.S. Government has views, it is not deemed good tactics to
                            propose a “U.S. solution” at this time, resistance to which might well
                            kill off meritorious ideas prematurely. We seek solutions arrived at
                            mutually, which accept the fact that the relative economic position of
                            the United States in the world has changed even though we remain in a
                            position of strength and leadership. We also wish to avoid a patchwork
                            solution to the monetary problem alone which would leave other basic
                            issues unresolved and could therefore prove unequal to the task of
                            restoring basic equilibrium in our balance of payments. The result of
                            such a failure could be demoralizing.</p>
                        <p>The following specific questions, which could come up at the meetings,
                            were noted: <list>

                                    expectation that broad solutions would be reached so soon. There
                                    was agreement for the first time that a fundamental realignment
                                    of currency values is necessary, and it was agreed that the
                                        <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>, the Group of Ten, and

                                    difficult and require solutions which are carefully evolved and
                                    not rushed. Our minds are open.</item>
                                <item>3—<hi rend="italic">Why won’t the United States agree to
                                        increase the dollar price of gold? Answer:</hi> Our concern
                                    at this time, insofar as the monetary system is concerned, is
                                    with determining the magnitude of the changes in relative
                                    exchange rates which are required to re-establish monetary
                                    equilibrium, and with the basic direction of the international
                                    monetary system. We are also concerned about trade and about
                                    greater sharing of the defense burden. (FYI: Treasury, while
                                    recognizing that U.S. agreement to a token devaluation of the
                                    dollar at this time would ease the political problems of other
                                    countries in up-valuing their currencies, nevertheless believes
                                    such U.S devaluation could set a precedent and lead to demands
                                    for further devaluation of the dollar, if efforts to
                                    re-establish equilibrium are not successful. End FYI)</item>
                                <item>4—<hi rend="italic">Why won’t the United States exempt <gloss

                                        surcharge? Answer:</hi> There has been no change in the
                                    basic U.S. position on <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0534"
                                    />trade policy, but we believe surcharge is required until the
                                    underlying issues are resolved in their totality and the
                                    prospects for the U.S. balance of payments have definitely
                                    improved. In the long run, the <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                        >LDC</gloss>s will be better off, since if satisfactory
                                    solutions are arrived at, the chances of a return to
                                    protectionism in world trade will be fewer. (FYI: Exempting
                                        <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s from the surcharge
                                    would be interpreted by <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> as
                                    an indication that we intend to keep the surcharge indefinitely.

                            to Washington, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> briefly reviewed the international monetary
                            problems. The Secretary said that in talking to the Italians in
                                London<note n="3" xml:id="d181fn3">This meeting was presumably held
                                on the fringes of the September 15-16 <gloss target="#t_G101"
                                    >G-10</gloss> Ministerial meeting.</note> he had outlined these
                            problems as including the U.S. import surcharge and the question of a
                            U.S. “contribution” to a settlement by a devaluation of the dollar in
                            terms of the price of gold. Both of the above-mentioned problems were
                            tied in with the question of an international realignment of parities
                            and the problem of how much each country would change in such a
                            realignment. This was a most difficult question. Since Germany, Canada,
                            Japan and the U.S. were already floating, the Secretary continued, he
                            had therefore suggested in his conversation with the Italians that it
                            might be worthwhile to explore whether everyone should take off all
                            controls and freely float for a while.</p>
                        <p>President Klasen interjected that such a proposition would be most
                            difficult for most countries. Jokingly he continued that it would be
                            more difficult for them than even a 20 percent devaluation would be for
                            the U.S. Minister <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName>
                            referred to the fact that some countries were even now floating
                            “dirtily” and that what was needed was a “code of good behavior” for
                            floating. In the present circumstances Germany was practically the only
                            country which was floating freely and as a result the DM was
                            appreciating at levels which everyone in Germany considered to be too
                            high. As someone had said, everyone was cheating except Germany. State
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Schoellhorn</persName> interjected
                            that as a result Germany might have to start cheating too. He said that
                            the public mentioning of various suggested percentage figures for a DM
                            appreciation by <persName corresp="#p_RHS1">Reuss</persName>, the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, etc., was causing much trouble in the
                            markets and driving the DM up. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1"
                                >Schoellhorn</persName> observed that as a result of the DM
                            appreciation during the last few days Japan in effect had devalued by 3
                            percent against the DM.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> said that the
                            U.S. had talked with Japan and Canada, but that everyone wanted to
                            proceed in a bloc and that we therefore had no one to talk to. President
                            Klasen interjected that in the currency realignment it was necessary for
                            everyone to know what everyone else was going to do. For Germany, thus
                            for example, it was essential to know what France would do. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> continued that we
                            realized the difficulties involved for everyone. What was important was
                            not to let these difficulties impair the excellent personal, political
                            and military relationships between Germany and the U.S. We were flexible
                            on how to get to a better alignment of parities and willing <pb n="508"
                                xml:id="pg_508" facs="0536"/>to do whatever would be helpful. We had
                            talked bilaterally to the Canadians, Italians, and Japanese. We were
                            prepared to talk and work with anyone bilaterally, multilaterally or
                            both at the same time. But we could not go back to the old system and
                            would have to work toward a new system which would satisfy us. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> continued that he
                            personally couldn’t care less about the price of gold—which Klasen had
                            raised previously—but this was a political matter. To change the price
                            of gold the U.S. Government would have to go to the U.S. Congress and
                            one could not know what would come out of the Congress if we did this.
                            The import surcharge was a most popular measure in the U.S. There was
                            much Congressional pressure to bring the troops home. While the price of
                            gold in his view was not a big substantive issue, this was a touchy
                            political question. Decisions on it could be made only on the political
                            level. Minister <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> said that
                            he agreed that the price of gold was mainly a mythological matter, but
                            it could help facilitate things.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> continued that
                            as far as the import surcharge was concerned, before we could remove it,
                            we would have some expression from others what they will do (in addition
                            to the currency realignment). There were some special problems with
                            Canada, Japan and Germany, but beyond that everyone was in the same
                            boat. As far as Europe in general was concerned, there was not a great
                            deal that we had to complain about aside from some specific cases. Thus,
                            for example, France recently had told a major U.S. manufacturer that he
                            could not sell in France unless he built a plant there. At the same time
                            France constantly complains about U.S. foreign investments. We will have
                            to work out such bilateral problems. Offset is one such problem which we
                            have to work out with Germany. But beyond this what role do you want us
                            to play? We are willing to talk with France, to negotiate, to do
                            whatever is wanted. But it must be clear that we cannot go back to the
                            old system.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> responded by asking what
                            would be the next step. The DM had now floated upward by 11 percent.
                            This was too much. What would be the U.S. reaction if Germany would be
                            forced to introduce capital controls? While he personally was opposed to
                            using capital controls, the time might come when he would have to do so.
                            The float of others was not an honest one. The continued deadlock was
                            hurting Germany. Klasen interjected that through this deadlock the U.S.
                            was punishing its best friend. <persName corresp="#p_SK6"
                                >Schiller</persName> said that in this situation it was essential to
                            negotiate.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> replied that
                            we were prepared to negotiate immediately. <persName corresp="#p_SK6"
                                >Schiller</persName> said that Germany could not negotiate
                            unilaterally. What Germany could do depended, for example, very much on
                            what Japan and France would do. It was necessary to talk about a deal in
                            the <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0537"/>Group of Ten. Klasen
                            interjected that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> had mentioned a <gloss target="#t_G101"
                                >G-10</gloss> meeting in November. Germany could not afford to wait
                            that long. <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> said that the
                            combination of the current rate of revaluation of the DM, the import
                            surcharge and the discriminatory aspects of the tax credit amounted to
                            an embargo of German machinery exports to the U.S. Klasen again stressed
                            the unacceptability of the current 11 percent rate of revaluation of the
                            DM and said that Germany could not continue to take the burdens of
                            currency readjustments alone.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> responded that
                            the November date for the next <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss>
                            meeting was an Italian proposal. He stressed the current health and
                            strength of the German economy and our readiness to do whatever the
                            Germans wanted us to do to help. Schoellhorn suggested that the U.S.
                            could express a willingness to participate in a realignment through an
                            increase in the price of gold. The Secretary remarked that that was a
                            political, not an economic, problem and asked if the German problem was
                            a political one. <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName>
                            responded that Germany’s problem was that it could not move without its
                            partners. If he knew that the U.S. was prepared to move for such and
                            such a price, then he, <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName>,
                            might be able to make progress with his partners. In response to a
                            question by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>
                            what he wanted us to do, <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName>
                            responded “what is your price for the surcharge?” Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> replied that we must be
                            assured that we can get our balance of payments into equilibrium within
                            a reasonably short period of time. We must have a better burden sharing
                            in defense, through arrangements arrived at with certain countries
                            either in concert or individually. We must get certain trade
                            restrictions removed, particularly by Japan and Canada. In the trade
                            field we were not asking too much from the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss>. We felt that their preferential trade arrangements with
                            Morocco and Israel, for example, violated the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss> and there should be no increase in agricultural
                            protection. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR1">Petty</persName> said it
                            would be most desirable that the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> limit
                            the product coverage of the common agricultural policy to those products
                            now covered. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>
                            said he realized that we cannot turn the U.S. balance of payments around
                            over night, but by 1973 we certainly must see some change. We must be
                            sure of a formula which gives us a real assurance that in a reasonably
                            short period of time we can look for equilibrium in our balance of
                            payments.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> said that it seemed as
                            though there might not be a solution for some period of time. But in the
                            meantime the economic situation in Germany would change. What would be
                            the U.S. reaction if after its economy had broken down, Germany would
                            return to its old parity. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR1"
                                >Petty</persName> asked how effective the French system of controls
                            was. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Schoellhorn</persName> answered that it
                            was very effective. France actually had sold dollars last week. Klasen
                            said that France and Italy could afford to wait. Germany could not. Now
                            the country which had helped the U.S. <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510"
                                facs="0538"/>the most was being hurt the most. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> interjected that he
                            appreciated the problems Germany was facing, but one should not lose
                            sight of the fact that our relationship has been good to both of us and
                            has made both of us pretty prosperous. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1"
                                >Schoellhorn</persName>, while generally agreeing with the
                            Secretary, mentioned German political sensitivity to inflation and the
                            problems caused prior to the float by the inflow of liquidity. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ1">Schoellhorn</persName> continued that the Secretary
                            had said that aside from the currency realignment we should look at
                            problems of trade and burden sharing. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1"
                                >Schoellhorn</persName> felt that it would not be possible to handle
                            all three problems at once. He felt that we should start with the
                            problem of the realignment of parities. If such a realignment could not
                            be accomplished quickly, we would get a world of capital controls. There
                            was very little time left.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> said that he
                            felt we could do all three (trade, burden sharing and realignment) at
                            the same time. It was not really as difficult as <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ1">Schoellhorn</persName> implied. He, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>, understood, for example,
                            that we were very close on the offset problem—only $85 million apart.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> agreed that the
                            offset was close to agreement. The Germans had adjourned the talks until
                            just after the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> meetings but then
                            expected to conclude an agreement quickly. Nevertheless, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> felt that the conditions
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> had mentioned for
                            the removal of the surcharge were very vague and hard.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> reiterated
                            that in order to remove the surcharge the U.S. had to have a formula
                            which gave real assurance that in a relatively short period of time we
                            can look for equilibrium in our balance of payments. If others did not
                            want to include trade restrictions and defense in the formula, then the
                            currency realignment would have to be that much larger. Thus, for
                            example, we could not get certain of our products—such as computers—into
                            Japan at all. The Japanese tariff on our beef was over 100 percent.
                            Exchange rate change alone could accomplish little in these situations.
                            This was different in the case of Germany. With Germany we would not
                            insist on including the question of burden sharing, but Germany should
                            be interested in joining us to put pressure on Japan for the removal of
                            trade restrictions. <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> and
                            Klasen agreed that pressure on Japan would be desirable.</p>
                        <p>Klasen asked the Secretary what ideas the U.S. had concerning the general
                            realignment of parities, assuming that it received satisfaction on the
                            trade and burden-sharing question. He felt that it was necessary to know
                            a figure in order to have a framework. What average realignment of the
                            dollar against the rest of world did the U.S. think to be necessary?
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> replied that
                            we have not yet made such a calculation because we felt it would be
                            presumptuous for us to tell others what to do. But we would now make
                            such a calculation and tell our partners what we think they should do,
                            what Germany should do, France, the <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511"
                                facs="0539"/>U.K., Japan should do. One figure will indicate what we
                            think it will take. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> stressed that while our partners can, of
                            course, question our figure, he hoped that they would not question the
                            honesty of our intentions. We did not want to take advantage of anyone
                            and our figure would be a reasonable one. We would get to work on the
                            figures this afternoon and provide them before the Germans left
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName>, in discussing the
                            interdependence of various national parity changes, stressed the key
                            position of France. Germany, for example, could not revalue by 10-11
                            percent vis-à-vis the dollar if France did not move at all. Germany had
                            already substantially revalued against France in the last few years and
                            a further move of such magnitude vis-à-vis the franc could not be sold
                            to the German public—20 percent of German exports went to France, only
                            10 percent to the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> asked whether
                            the Germans thought that in the hypothetical case of a U.S. devaluation,
                            the French would stay put or also devalue. Klasen replied positively
                            that France would stay put, while <persName corresp="#p_SK6"
                                >Schiller</persName> was not so sure. Both agreed that in such a
                            case the U.S. should insist on a price agreement by France not to follow
                            suit. <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> indicated the
                            German position on the increase in the price of gold was “cool” but they
                            felt it could facilitate a realignment. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJR1"
                                >Petty</persName> pointed out that an increase in the price of gold
                            would be a step backward by also increasing its role in the monetary
                            system. Klasen said that the Germans do not think that after an increase
                            in the price of gold, the U.S. should restore the full gold
                            convertibility of the dollar. The Secretary said he had hoped Klasen
                            would say that, because we could not do it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> said that in the last few
                            days he had become very pessimistic. He was afraid there would not be
                            any movement forward and Klasen stressed that the rest of the world had
                            become accustomed to America taking the lead in a crisis. He felt the
                            U.S. must make some proposal. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> said that we will do this, even though the
                            minute we do, everyone will accuse us of trying to dictate to the rest
                            of the world.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Schoellhorn</persName> asked if it might be
                            possible not to apply the discriminatory aspects of the investment trade
                            credit. He said that $600 million of German exports are involved. In
                            addition, there is the danger that others will copy this type of tax
                            credit.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> indicated that
                            he hoped to have some further discussions with <persName

                                <item>—The surcharge is a wasting negotiating asset since it is not
                                    as detrimental to most foreign economies as many felt at the
                                    outset, and other governments will institute measures to
                                    compensate for it.</item>
                                <item>—Our highest priority is an exchange rate realignment which
                                    redresses, or moves toward redressing, the U. S. balance of
                                    payments deficit.</item>
                                <item>—There are major economic advantages in other nations floating
                                    their currencies, rather than repegging in the very near

                                the following proposal: “The United States declares that it stands
                                ready to abolish its import surcharge and capital controls
                                immediately with respect to imports from any country that permits
                                its currency to float freely.” The paper then explores a number of
                                issues relating to the proposal, such as the operational definition
                                of a free float, how to deal with developing countries that
                                traditionally had pegged their par values to the dollar or another
                                key currency, and the legality under <gloss target="#t_GATT1"

                        </p>
                        <p>Following the Bank/Fund meetings we should have a better feel for how far
                            the Europeans and Japanese are willing to go in meeting our demands.
                            However, we will still be far from an internal USG position. Forces
                            within the USG which wish to squeeze every ounce of blood out of Europe
                            and Japan regardless of the political costs will vie with those who wish
                            to lift the surcharge without the quid pro quos which the hardliners
                            would regard as acceptable. The logic of the former group would lead to
                            no removal of the surcharge for a long period—i. e. until major trade
                            and monetary concessions are realized—and will exacerbate political and
                            economic relations with our trading partners, as well as running the
                            risk of a trade war. The position of the latter, although commendable
                            for its economic logic, is destined to be rejected on domestic political
                            grounds.</p>
                        <p>Specific problems to be reconciled are: <list>
                                <item>—How long can thesurcharge remain in effect before other
                                    governments are forced to take offsetting economic actions or
                                    retaliate. (The answer probably depends on how sincere and
                                    reasonable they believe we are in working out a solution which
                                    will enable us to remove the surcharge, but in any event the
                                    risk becomes greater if no significant progress has been made by
                                    the end of November.)</item>
                                <item>—Whether we can get a satisfactory repegging of other
                                    currencies without devaluing the dollar vis-à-vis gold. (The
                                    answer is probably negative, in which case a repegging exercise
                                    would be a long ordeal—with significant domestic political
                                    implications—during which the surcharge would probably remain in
                                    effect.)</item>
                                <item>—Whether we can negotiate within a reasonably short period of
                                    time significant trade and defense burden sharing arrangements
                                    which the President can point to as justification for removal of
                                    the surcharge. (On trade the answer is probably yes, although
                                    the hardliners might not be completely satisfied; on defense
                                    burden sharing we may have to settle for much less.)</item>

                        <p>I have drawn up a brief scenario which provides the relative hard-liners
                            some quid pro quos, but enables the President to remove the surcharge by
                            the middle of November, when the domestic Phase I is completed. Under
                            this scenario we would: <list>

                                    would provide us with tangible results within a period of 6-8
                                    weeks. (<persName corresp="#p_PPG1">Peterson</persName> has a
                                    list of such issues.)</item>
                                <item>—Indicate privately and at the highest levels to Canada,
                                    Japan, Germany, and perhaps one or two other of our trading
                                    partners, minimum acceptable levels to which we would expect
                                    their currencies to float within the next two months; and, that
                                    while we would have no objection to their maintaining their
                                    rates at these levels temporarily, through central bank
                                    intervention, we would expect that once the surcharge was
                                    removed they would float upwards by an agreed number of
                                    percentage points. (Floating is preferable to repegging in that
                                    repegging negotiations would be prolonged, raise sensitive
                                    questions about the gold value of the dollar, and might limit
                                    the President’s future options should he decide in Stage II to
                                    press for a floating or very flexible exchange rate
                                    system.)</item>
                                <item>—Seek public assurances at the highest levels from the key
                                    members of the Group of 10 that negotiations would begin
                                    immediately on new international monetary system (which would
                                    have greater flexibility and greater liquidity than the present
                                    system) and on our major trade and burden sharing
                                    problems.</item>
                                <item>—We would not negotiate either convertibility or devaluation
                                    of the dollar vis-à-vis gold in the first round. The former is
                                    our major lever for securing the desired international monetary
                                    reforms in the second stage. The latter would raise issues which
                                    could not be resolved within a two or three-month period (thus
                                    prolonging the surcharge) and could cause adverse domestic
                                    criticism by those who regard the value of the dollar as a
                                    sacred and inviolable concept. Moreover, it is unnecessary to
                                    devalue in Stage I since the level of the float is a
                                    transitional “half-way house”.</item>
                                <item>—When the trade and burden sharing negotiations had borne
                                    sufficient fruit and major currencies had floated above the
                                    minimum levels (by early November), the President could announce
                                    removal of the surcharge, point to its success on the monetary,
                                    trade and defense burden sharing front, and to public assurances
                                    by other nations that there would be future negotiations on an
                                    improved monetary system and on additional trade and burden
                                    sharing arrangements favorable to the U.S. He would not at that
                                    time announce the agreement that other currencies would continue
                                    to float upward to the agreed levels (because speculation <pb

                                    rapidly), but could point to the increases subsequently in order
                                    to justify, ex post removal of the surcharge should he be
                                    attacked domestically for doing so. We would not resume gold
                                    convertibility nor, under this scheme, devalue the dollar
                                    vis-à-vis gold (although this would be a conceivable fallback if

                        <p>In general the atmosphere improved during that week in comparison with
                            the period following the Group of Ten meeting in London. This
                            improvement showed up in the agreement by the Group of Ten Ministers and
                            Governors on the agenda of immediate issues that require resolution: the
                            magnitude and method of a realignment of currencies, the adoption of
                            somewhat wider exchange rate margins around par, the discontinuance of
                            the import surcharge, and measures in the field of trade and defense
                            burden sharing. At the same time the Ministers instructed their Deputies
                            to explore the problems of longer-term reform of the international
                            monetary system. The improvement also showed up in the tone of the
                            comments, both public and private, of numerous officials. Certainly,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>’s speech
                            contributed to the better atmosphere by its indication of a readiness to
                            negotiate on the part of the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0544"/>
                        <p>I turn now to a summary report on my private discussions with foreign
                            officials.</p>
                        <p>Many Europeans stressed that Europe is on the edge of a distinct slowdown
                            in economic activity, if not a recession. The relevance of this
                            observation is that, as time goes on, it will become increasingly
                            difficult for European governments to agree on a significant upvaluation
                            of their currencies in relation to the dollar, since such a change in
                            exchange rates will aggravate recessionary correlations. The same is
                            true of Japan. This consideration reinforces what is already a good case
                            for getting ahead with serious negotiations as quickly as possible.</p>
                        <p>In a lengthy discussion with the French (Finance Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName> and central bank
                            Governor Wormser), I was told that the price of gold in terms of francs
                            is an important political issue in France, given the widespread and
                            long-standing custom of the French population to hold gold as a hedge
                            against inflation and political uncertainty. This makes it difficult, if
                            not impossible, for a French political leader to agree to a revaluation
                            of the franc against an unchanged dollar, since the franc price of gold
                            would then fall. On the other hand, I came away from this candid
                            conversation with the definite impression that the French Government
                            would stand still for a 5 or 6 per cent increase in the dollar price of
                            gold, leaving the franc price where it is. The British and the Italians
                            are likely to follow the French lead.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese (Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM4"
                                >Mizuta</persName> and Governor Sasaki) were not ready to talk
                            seriously but stressed to me the uncertain durability of Japan’s large
                            trade surplus. It is notable, however, that the Japanese authorities
                            have been permitting the market rate of the yen to creep upward day by
                            day, so that it is now 9 per cent above the old parity. Moreover, I
                            received indications from some dependable (I think) emissaries that the
                            Japanese will be willing to settle for a 15 per cent appreciation,
                            provided other countries move at the same time.</p>
                        <p>The Germans (Bundesbank President Klasen) have permitted their currency
                            to float up about 10 per cent since May and are coming under severe
                            pressure from businessmen, who are feeling the effects not only of the
                            exchange rate change but also the surcharge and the job development
                            credit (which, as you know, does not apply to imported equipment). The
                            Germans are particularly sensitive about the movement of their exchange
                            rate against the French franc. For these reasons, as well as the
                            prospective slowdown in the economy, their officials indicated that they
                            are anxious for an early settlement.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> and I met with
                            the assembled Finance Ministers and central bank Governors of Latin
                            America. We explained the rationale for the U.S. program and, after the
                            Secretary left, I took their questions. The main concerns they expressed
                            were: Why should the surcharge <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0545"
                            />apply to them and other developing countries when we do not expect
                            them to appreciate their exchange rates or take other actions to improve
                            the U.S. balance of payments? How can the <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss>’s participate in the negotiations about both the
                            immediate problems and reform of the international monetary system? I
                            reassured them on the last point, and some overt moves in this direction
                            are now being considered.</p>
                        <p>There is one highly important matter—regarding the arrangements for
                            negotiations—on which I need to report to you in person. It is a matter
                            which I arranged with foreign representatives and of which Secretary

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Paul:</p>
                        <p>As you know from our various discussions, I would think it very desirable
                            if you would use the <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>
                            Group to start some intense dialogue and work soon on what kind of
                            reformed monetary system we want.</p>
                        <p>This seems awfully important in two different contexts: First, as we move
                            ahead in our Phase I negotiations, it may well be that where we want to
                            end up in Phase II will affect what we should be willing to do or not do
                            in Phase I. Second, the President and <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">John
                                Connally</persName> have repeatedly emphasized their commitment to
                            basic monetary reform and I think it is incumbent upon us to define what
                            we want that system to be. I know that men like <persName
                                corresp="#p_DKW1">Ken Dam</persName> and Ezra Solomon have strong
                            views about what the shape of such a system might be. There are certain
                                <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0546"/>key issues—like whether it
                            is in the long-term U.S. interests to have any convertibility at all and
                            the related issue of whether a reserve currency status is or is not in
                            the interests of the U.S.—that I hear very different views on, as I
                            listen to various experts.</p>
                        <p>I asked Dick Cooper, who works with us, if he couldn’t summarize for me
                            what some of the key issues are on this whole area. I’ve attached a copy
                            and sent one to <persName corresp="#p_DKW1">Ken Dam</persName> and Ezra

                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> Group going on this
                            whole issue of what kind of monetary system we want.<note n="3"

                            European Community. The paper contains a number of specific negotiating

                            currency. The President thought that would be illegal under <gloss

                            a “way to get the ball rolling.” Although not in agreement on this
                            issue, the President nonetheless clearly wanted <persName

                            in bringing the international monetary crisis to resolution. He said

                            and could better “broker” a solution than the others. He did not want to

                                >Shultz</persName> was not sure where <persName corresp="#p_BAF1"
                                >Burns</persName> stood on the issue and thought he was more
                            concerned with maintenance of the wage/price freeze; he thought
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> would agree with
                            the President there should be no return to convertibility and that
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> would have to be
                            instructed to work on a plan with that approach. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> carefully explained, and the
                            President agreed, that if there were a return to fixed <pb n="522"
                                xml:id="pg_522" facs="0550"/>parities and convertibility, the only
                            way to address a balance-of-payments deficit would be to deflate the
                            domestic economy to lower prices, creating “unemployment to satisfy
                            international pressure.” The President said he did not want domestic
                            policies to be affected by the outmoded system and “we can build a
                            system without convertibility.” Although he did not press the point,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> clearly favored a
                            floating rate system.</p>

                            discussed the price of gold. <persName corresp="#p_SGP1"
                                >Shultz</persName> expressed the opinion that with all the gold in
                            French “mattresses,” gold was a big political problem in France, and it
                            might be necessary to change the relationship of the dollar to gold in
                            order to devalue the dollar. The President agreed that “damn gold has a
                            mystique” but said “I’ll be damned if we will raise the price of gold
                            like <persName>Arthur</persName> wants.” (National Archives, <persName

                        <p>The tape of the Quadriad conversation evinces a wide-ranging discussion
                            of international economic policy issues. <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> was praised for bringing the issues forward
                            from where they were in August, and <persName corresp="#p_SGP1"
                                >Shultz</persName> said that now that “we have their attention” it
                            was time to move vigorously on negotiations. While <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> was traveling, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> would work with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to see what leverage the
                            United States had with France, which he said would not revalue (by
                            changing the franc price of gold). <persName corresp="#p_BAF1"
                                >Burns</persName> returned to that point later in the conversation
                            and in a lengthy discourse explained how gold was a “huge political
                            problem” for the French. He said his discussions with French officials
                            convinced him France would settle for a stable price of gold in terms of
                            French francs, and indicated that if the United States could otherwise
                            get a good settlement, the United States should not be stuck on “gold
                            theology.” <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName> said the French
                            would let the franc appreciate in terms of dollars, thought the other
                            Europeans and the Japanese would support France on this position, and
                            said domestically France had less of a political problem than in 1968
                            when the market price of gold equaled the official price. Under the
                            two-tier system, with the market price above the official price,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName> said Congressman
                                <persName corresp="#p_RHS1">Reuss</persName> and Senator Proxmire
                            would support a small increase in the official price of gold. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> terminated that subject, noting
                            that the President had said they would not increase the price of gold.
                            He then posed the question of whether they were going to return to fixed
                            parities or try to operate with floating rates. He said the price of
                            gold was incidental to this more fundamental question and the
                            complementary issues of trade and burdensharing agreements. He said the
                            administration needed to have a clear picture of where it wanted to come
                            out.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> set out a five-point
                            program that he thought could be negotiated during the next few months:
                            first, a significant realignment in currency parities; second, no return
                            to convertibility for at least 2 years, other than small transactions in
                                <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s as required for technical
                            purposes; third, an agreement on trade principles and the removal of
                            trade barriers, with the details to be worked out later; fourth, an
                            agreement on a substantial, if not complete, reduction in the role of
                            gold in the international monetary system; and fifth, agreement that the
                            dollar would no longer be the sole vehicle currency.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> said the average U.S.
                            citizen neither understood nor cared about monetary policy, but did care
                            about trade and the fact that the administration was looking out for
                            U.S. interests. Politically, it was thus necessary to discuss trade and
                            burdensharing even if that were to delay his negotiating strategy for
                            another year. Currency realignment, he said, was much less important
                            than not giving the impression the United States was losing ground.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> noted that it would
                            be a “mistake of <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0552"/>major
                            political importance” for the President to get just a currency
                            realignment without also obtaining the other objectives.</p>
                        <p>The President concluded this segment of the discussion suggesting that in
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>’s absence the
                            others work on the process on a very confidential basis, and they not
                            have a further discussion “at this level” until <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> returned. The official line
                            would be that there would be no action in <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName>’s absence, the President was still examining
                            the options, and would await a report from <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> when he returned from Japan.</p>
                        <p>Following a brief photo opportunity for <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> with the President, the Quadriad then discussed
                            domestic economic issues. <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> stayed on after the meeting concluded.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> reported on his
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> the
                            previous day, and explained their recommendation that the President
                            should say there should be no discussion of the price of gold or
                            convertibility. See <ref target="#d189">Document 189</ref>.</p>
                        <p>The President, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> then commented
                            briefly on aspects of international economic policy before turning to
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>’s forthcoming trip.
                            Japan was central, and the President expressed the opinion that
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName> was incorrect in his
                            view that Japan would not deal on the international economic issues
                            unless Europe also made a deal. <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> agreed. The President suggested that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> take the approach that “this
                            President intends to keep the United States in the Pacific and the
                            Pacific should receive more attention.” In that context, what sort of
                            deal could Japan make. <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>
                            requested the President’s authority to tell the Japanese that with
                            European consolidation European nations were increasingly speaking with
                            one voice and should have only one vote in the <gloss target="#t_G101"

                        <list>
                            <item>—The longer the surcharge is retained, the less of a bargaining
                                asset it is and the greater the risk that it will harm our overall
                                economic, foreign policy and security interests.</item>
                            <item>—Recognizing this, the surcharge should be removed in return for
                                small amounts of additional depreciation of the yen, mark, and
                                Canadian dollar, plus a minimum list of additional desiderata in the
                                area of trade and defense burden sharing which can be negotiated

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> seems to have
                            departed from what many had perceived to be a more “cooperative” line.
                            Last week in San Francisco he told the American Bankers Association that
                            the surcharge “is going to stay on for a while because it frankly is to
                            our advantage to keep it on for a while.”<note n="3" xml:id="d188fn3">No

                                    >Hormats</persName> quotes in his memorandum is in a brief
                                section on international economic policy, followed by: “It is going
                                to come off when this nation has some assurance that our
                                balance-of-payments deficit will indeed be rectified or until we can
                                be assured that the mechanism is established by which it can be
                                rectified.”</note> The Europeans, Canadians, and Japanese, as the
                            result of this and other such statements, increasingly believe that the
                            U.S. is unwilling to cooperate with them to bring about conditions for
                            removal of the surcharge. And there are indications that they feel that
                            even if they are forthcoming, the U.S. will maintain an unreasonable
                            posture and retain the surcharge indefinitely.</p>

                            <item>—Many of our key trading partners (including Italy and Germany)
                                are faced with economic recessions and growing unemployment. While
                                the U.S. surcharge is obviously not the main cause of these
                                problems, it may be a partial cause. At any rate, because of it the
                                U.S. will be used as a scapegoat, thus making it increasingly
                                difficult for other nations—no matter how well disposed they or
                                their leaders have been toward us—to cooperate with us on economic,
                                political, or security matters.</item>
                            <item>—Canada and others are taking, or are considering taking,
                                countermeasures such as instituting restrictions on monetary or
                                trade flows. Vested interests in those countries will seek to
                                maintain these controls thus making future negotiations more
                                difficult. And such negotiations could become primarily efforts to
                                eliminate countermeasures rather than the trade barriers and
                                exchange rate inequities which were our original targets. [State

                                    President’s Economic Program” for October 29. The report
                                    indicated that about 20 diplomatic notes had been received
                                    protesting one or more U.S. actions and most of the U.S. major
                                    trading partners had threatened “appropriate compensatory

                                    proposal be enacted.” The report noted that a senior German
                                    official told the Embassy in Bonn that the European Community
                                    had turned its attention to internal solutions, was hardening
                                    its position toward the United States, and that “Germany’s

                                    position toward the U.S. was weakened by confusing reports of a

                            <item>—As other nations institute countermeasures, and become less
                                disposed and less able to cooperate with us to bring about the
                                changes we desire, the surcharge becomes a wasting asset. In
                                addition it becomes increasingly detrimental to our overall economic
                                and political interests. By contributing, even at the margin, to a
                                deterioration in international trade and in the economies of our
                                major trading partners, which will decrease U.S. exports, it runs
                                the risk of harming our overall economic interests and, rightly or
                                wrongly, increasing the intensity of domestic and foreign criticism
                                of the President. And to the extent that the international political
                                system is harmed by the spillover effect, the same reaction will
                                occur. Far from being in our interest, long-term retention of the
                                surcharge can be extremely detrimental to our interests.</item>

                                to think the President might recommend a change; you also will not

                                calling for a US contribution (i.e., devaluation) to the currency
                                realignment, the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> must be able to
                                tell the US for how large a devaluation of the dollar in terms of
                                gold its members would be willing to stand still (i.e., not also
                                devalue their own currencies). In the <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530"

                                    >Giscard</persName> gave the other Ministers a clear idea how
                                large a US devaluation France could accept. While Tietmeyer was not
                                willing to give the Financial Attache the exact figure, the
                                Financial Attache gained the impression that it is more than 5
                                percent (a change of the dollar parity to 37 or possible 37-1/2
                                ounces of gold). <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName>
                                also indicated that France could accept a devaluation of this
                                magnitude only if the following other conditions are met: (A)
                                France’s competitive position vis-à-vis Italy and the UK is not
                                impaired, i.e., Italy and the UK also do not devalue their
                                currencies in terms of gold; (B) France’s competitive position
                                vis-à-vis the Benelux countries is slightly improved, i.e., these
                                countries revalue by at least 2 percent; (C) France’s competitive
                                position vis-à-vis Germany is improved substantially—Tietmeyer did
                                not specifically indicate by how much, but the Financial Attache
                                gained the impression that the figure is in the 5-6 percent
                                range.</item>

                                “contribution” of dollar devaluation of this magnitude and would be
                                willing to remove the import surcharge in return for a package of
                                revaluation and “standing still” by the other industrial countries
                                which together with the US devaluation would improve the competitive
                                position of the dollar by roughly 10 percent vis-à-vis the other
                                major industrial countries as a group. On the basis of his

                                    >Schiller</persName> apparently has gained the impression that

                                close to it might be a minimum acceptable to the US.<note n="6"

                            scheduled for November 22-23, 1971, in Rome. In view of an anticipated,

                            the Rome Ministerial should be postponed. Secretary <persName

                            because the monetary meeting had to take place before he met with

                            <p rend="center">The strategic situation on re-alignment</p>
                            <p>After the meeting of the Finance Ministers of the Six in Versailles
                                on November 4, the situation regarding further progress has become
                                much clearer. It can be summed up as follows: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>No move can be expected in the gold parity of the French
                                        Franc. This has to be taken—and has been accepted
                                        (willy-nilly) by the Six—as an immovable corner stone of any
                                        future arrangement. However, in the case of a downward
                                        adjustment of the dollar parity, the French are prepared to
                                        maintain their present gold parity, or in other words, to
                                        tolerate a de-facto appreciation in relation to the dollar
                                        (this has been told by <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard
                                            d’Estaing</persName>, although indirectly, even to the
                                        press).</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>The French Franc will serve as a “leading indicator” (or
                                        example) for the exchange rate policies of Italy and
                                        Britain. Neither of the two is prepared to move its parity
                                        up in relation to the Franc (which they, rightly, consider
                                        to be inherently stronger than their own currencies). Both
                                        these other countries seem, however, to be prepared to
                                        maintain, in case of a downward adjustment of the dollar,
                                        their previous parity, provided the French do the same. Some
                                        other European countries are likely to take their cue, too,
                                        from the French Franc (plus the Lira and the Pound).</item>
                                    <label>3.</label>
                                    <item>The readiness of the French to stay put as concerns their
                                        gold parity depends, of course, on the amount of the
                                        downward adjustment in the dollar parity. No one could at
                                        present say whether the “threshold of tolerance” is 5 or 6.
                                        There are, however, enough signs to the effect that the
                                        tolerance level would be high enough to permit an average
                                        shift between the dollar and the other G 10 currencies
                                        (incl. the Swiss franc) of 9 to 10%. The exact magnitude of
                                        the French “tolerance level” can only be found out once it
                                        is assured that the dollar itself moves.</item>
                                    <label>4.</label>
                                    <item>A de-facto appreciation of the French Franc in the
                                        foreseeable magnitude would in all probability allow the
                                        German DMark to be raised sufficiently high vis-à-vis the
                                        dollar, while attaining a more reasonable relationship
                                        vis-à-vis the Franc and other important European currencies.
                                        This would then also permit to bring the Japanese Yen into
                                        the proper line, viz. a fairly high appreciation in <pb

                                        dollar, a more moderate upvaluation in relation to the main
                                        European currencies.</item>
                                    <label>5.</label>
                                    <item>If on the American side there were no readiness to reduce
                                        the dollar parity, then the whole negotiating process would
                                        get stuck. It is simply erroneous to believe, that a
                                        German-French tête a tête could in any way break the
                                        deadlock. Even if it were to lead to an agreement on the
                                        future relationship between the DMark and the Franc (which
                                        would certainly be on a lesser disparity than at present),
                                        there would be no way from there to a satisfactory
                                        collective agreement on the re-alignment question.</item>
                                    <label>6.</label>
                                    <item>It is, therefore, a misjudgment to believe that a
                                        German-French summit, if it preceded the G 10 meeting, could
                                        do much good for the latter. Ideally, the time sequence
                                        should be reversed: If the G 10 meeting should end in
                                        visible failure, then a subsequent German-French meeting
                                        might perhaps lay the foundation for a regional (European)
                                        monetary set-up.</item>

                            <item>Neale said Chancellor Barber had found this report most
                                disturbing. He realized that Secretary had been in Far East and was
                                not sure how much he had been able to keep in touch with most recent
                                developments but felt that the French willingness to hold the
                                present gold parity of the franc in face of increase in dollar price
                                of gold was very significant concession on their part. He was thus
                                puzzled by press report that <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                    >Connally</persName> was attributing the delay to difficulties
                                within Europe. He said that the <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss>
                                participants had been quite willing and prepared for November 22
                                meeting and that the postponement was attributable to the US.</item>

                            <item>In response to questions to what extent Europeans had agreed on
                                actual numbers among themselves, Neale said his feeling was
                                agreement between French and Germans on franc-DM differential was in
                                the offing and could be realized fairly quickly. He said that on
                                dollar-franc differential, thinking centered around figure of 5
                                percent but he did not have figure for franc-DM differential. The
                                other European exchange rates, he felt, would come along and fall
                                into line without much difficulty. He pointed out that all this, of
                                course, depends on how far the Japanese are prepared to move since
                                the thinking is there must be some differential between European
                                rates and the yen. Hence, in his view, the key rates were the
                                franc-DM rate and the DM-yen rate. But the European settlement was
                                dependent on the US being prepared to raise the price of gold
                                (implicitly 5 percent).</item>

                            <item>We pointed out that US continues to feel that it is incumbent on
                                the other countries to take initiatives and make constructive
                                proposals. We were aware that French reportedly prepared to maintain
                                the gold parity of franc but this did not seem to us a move so
                                significant as to put the ball back into our court. Apart from the
                                substantive issues, there was some feeling in Washington that the
                                Europeans were approaching the problem entirely in terms of
                                individual national interests whereas we felt a more constructive
                                multilateral approach to a common world problem was in order. We
                                also noted that trade and burdensharing were factors in the overall
                                settlement and we had seen no disposition on the part of the
                                Community to even consider what they might do in the trade area.
                                Neale said he was not familiar with precisely what the US was
                                pressing the Community for on trade and said he understood that we
                                were not gunning for the UK in this area. Mitchell said that his
                                discussions in Washington had revealed a good deal of naivete about
                                what could be done on trade matters in the Common Market. He said
                                they <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0565"/>don’t seem to realize

                                    press conference remarks, if made in knowledge that French
                                    willing to hold franc-gold parity in face of dollar devaluation,
                                    appears to them to preclude both these possibilities. Neale
                                    today did not emphasize necessity of US declaring itself first
                                    on gold price increase, as he has before. Their immediate
                                    concern now appears to be that the US not preclude the
                                    possibility ahead of time.</p>
                                <p>In UK view, there are no real difficulties within Europe, rather
                                    the basic obstacle is the US and possibly Japan. If the US is
                                    prepared to move on the dollar gold price and the Japanese
                                    revalue enough to leave a sufficient DM-yen differential, the
                                    intra-European exchange rate realignment could be agreed among
                                    the Europeans fairly quickly. While Neale did not say how much
                                    differential between the DM and yen was required, he gave as
                                    illustrative figures 15 percent for the yen and 10 percent for
                                    the DM.<note n="5" xml:id="d193fn5">On November 12 President

                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary explained that the President had to take the steps he did
                            on August 15 to prevent any decline in our ability to maintain adequate
                            military strength to ensure security, and to avoid the destruction of
                            our ability to maintain an economic assistance program. Only by
                            maintaining a strong economy, he reasoned, could we support our economic
                            assistance efforts and even some increase in our defense establishment.
                            The President is now able to move to reduce tensions with the <pb
                                n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0567"/>USSR and the PRC because he is
                            dealing from strength, but he cautioned the American economy must be
                            kept strong.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the Secretary bears a heavy responsibility
                            on his shoulders. He appreciated that the President’s peace diplomacy
                            depended on the continued maintenance of a strong deterrent posture in
                            the interest of peace, and agreed that the American economy must be kept
                            strong to ensure that purpose.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM4"
                                >Mizuta</persName> had informed him of his earlier discussions with
                            the Secretary.<note n="2" xml:id="d194fn2">No record of this

                                    >Connally</persName> met with the Finance Minister prior to his
                                meeting with <persName corresp="#p_FT1">Fukuda</persName>. The
                                memorandum records that <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                    >Connally</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_FT1"
                                    >Fukuda</persName> “there is a strong feeling in the United
                                States that the United States has given freely of its natural
                                resources and its people these past 25 years and that frankly this
                                is being abused by some of our friends around the world. For
                                example, he said, in 1971 Japan’s growth included a 25% increase in
                                exports, and the accumulation of foreign exchange assets at the rate
                                of $1 billion per month, to the point that Japan’s foreign exchange
                                totals $13.5 billion, more than any other country except Germany,
                                and greater than the United States. The American people don’t
                                understand Japan’s restrictions against computers, aircraft and
                                agricultural products.” (Ibid.)</note> He speculated that the
                            present monetary situation would not be easily resolved, since the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> tends to move as a bloc, but one
                            of its members, France, does not understand why it should move at all.
                            He recalled meeting General DeGaulle, who threw out his chest and
                            proclaimed that France would develop nuclear weapons to ensure its own
                            defense; even though he admitted that France was too poor to afford a
                            nuclear parity with the United States, DeGaulle wanted a force d’frappe
                            to free France from its dependence on NATO. He commented that France is
                            incapable of cooperating with anyone, even in economic matters. Japan is
                            cooperating, he noted, but there is a need to persuade France to do so,
                            much more than Germany.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed completely, and said that it is easier to persuade
                            all the other European countries than France, which seems to have a
                            fixation about nuclear weapons as well as gold.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the United States had been generous with
                            many countries, and that Canada and Japan, and the NATO countries,
                            including Germany, would cooperate in an effort to rebuild the United
                            States economy, but he feared that this objective could not be easily
                            achieved in the <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss>. He asked for the
                            Secretary’s frank and confidential appraisal of the prospects and of the
                            role he expected Japan to play.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he had just postponed the <gloss
                                target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> meeting supposed to be held November
                            22-23, because discussions with the representatives of its members gave
                            clear signs of a direct collision with <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540"

                                    <persName corresp="#p_FT1">Fukuda</persName> the previous
                                evening (see <ref target="#d194fn2">footnote 2</ref> above), the
                                Secretary said he had been discussing postponing the <gloss
                                    target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> meeting with Under Secretary
                                    <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>, and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_FT1">Fukuda</persName>, also referring to France,
                                had agreed there was no point to a <gloss target="#t_G101"
                                    >G-10</gloss> meeting without some prospect for success.</note>
                            The other nations feared that no good would come of a meeting at this
                            time, he said, and presently consideration is being given to a meeting
                            December 7-8, although a new date has not been fixed.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed that it would be best not to meet until
                            adequate preparations had been made. He apologized for not catching the
                            news story about the postponement by explaining that he rarely reads
                            newspapers because he finds their excessive hostility to his government
                            distasteful.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary, by way of clarification, said that a meeting for the
                                <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> was not planned for November
                            22-23; the members were merely being sounded out, but the French leaked
                            a report that it would be canceled.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said little good would be served by speaking ill of
                            France, but he noted that General DeGaulle, indebted as he was for the
                            help of the Allied Powers, never thought of returning any favors.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that France had its problems, and that the UK would
                            probably follow the French lead, at least until it obtained full
                            membership in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the UK could probably play a useful role in
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> vis-à-vis France in view of its
                            special relationship with the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that one would think so, but these days, with its
                            membership in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> pending, the UK
                            could hardly be called helpful.</p>
                        <p>Still the Prime Minister thought that UK membership in the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> would be beneficial in the long run
                            since its presence would make it easier for the United States to present
                            its views to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Changing the subject, the Prime Minister said that he is deeply concerned
                            that Japan and many other countries are feeling a sharp recession, which
                            could, if unchecked, slip into a world depression. The United States
                            economy is fundamental to this situation, he observed, but it could not
                            be called bankrupt. Nevertheless mounting waves of recession could be
                            seen on all sides and a reliable world system had to be rebuilt quickly.
                            He did not believe that a breakdown in the system would lead to war at
                            this late date in history.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed that the United States had to correct its imbalance.
                            Had it not acted August 15 to suspend gold convertibility it would <pb
                                n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0569"/>have been exporting its
                            depression to the world, he said, and the President felt that he had to
                            act to bolster our own economy which was weakening to the danger
                            point.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he fully understood the need to suspend gold
                            convertibility, but felt that the time had come to consider replacing it
                            with a new system, based perhaps on <gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                            >SDR</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister felt that it might get easier to deal with floating
                            rates, and as more experience is accumulated exchange rates might be
                            decided more naturally on that basis. He suggested considering a new
                            system because there could be no return to gold convertibility, and
                            perhaps floating exchange rates would provide a self-adjusting basis for
                            realignment. He had not given up hope of a return to fixed rates (but
                            not gold convertibility) although he conceded that the day of fixed
                            rates might also end at some point.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister added that monetary adjustments are also of vital
                            concern to the one million Okinawans who live on a dollar economy.
                            Fortunately he worked out an arrangement with Finance Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MM4">Mizuta</persName> to provide for the Okinawans to
                            exchange their dollar holdings for yen upon reversion at the old rate,
                            360-1.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then told the Prime Minister that he had made no specific
                            suggestions about currency adjustment, burden sharing or trade
                            liberalization in his discussion of United States economic problems with
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> Cabinet Ministers he had met; he
                            had only outlined the nature of the United States problem and expressed
                            the hope that they would consider how best Japan could help. He said
                            that he informed all the Ministers that the United States seeks only to
                            balance its payments, not to gain advantage over any other country, and
                            looked forward to receiving suggestions on how Japan would help in
                            whatever manner is politically acceptable and least offensive and
                            economically feasible.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked whether all the Ministers passed this
                            examination.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that all were interested in the amount expected of
                            Japan. Our own study, he explained, disclosed that the Yen would have to
                            be revalued 24%, the Mark 18% and the Franc 13% to yield the $13 billion
                            swing the United States needed in its payments, but he conceded that
                            this much might not be politically feasible for Japan, in one bite.
                            Although the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> and other
                            international agencies disagreed with our own $13 billion figure,
                            nevertheless he noted they did agree that the United States needed a
                            swing ranging from $8-$10 billion to balance its payments. Of all the
                            Ministers he met, he said he only informed Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MM4">Mizuta</persName> of this 24% figure; he listened
                            without comment.</p>
                        <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0570"/>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked whether Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM4"
                                >Mizuta</persName> fainted, and whether the Secretary is serious
                            about the 24% figure.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM4"
                                >Mizuta</persName> might have been shocked, but he didn’t faint. He
                            is quite serious about his figures, the Secretary said, because a
                            Federal Reserve Board computer study showed that the United States
                            needed a $13 billion swing to balance its payments. Even after deducting
                            the $1 billion allowed for errors and omissions, and $1 billion for
                            safety, the figures showed, to be objective, a need for an $11 billion
                            swing, which is not too far out of line with the $8-$10 billion swing
                            the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                                >OECD</gloss> admit the United States needs. Calculations based on
                            the $13 billion figure showed that the Yen had to be revalued 24%, the
                            Mark 18% and the Franc 13%, but he admitted that 24% might be
                            unrealistic to expect of Japan in one step.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister noted the September improvement in the United States
                            balance, and asked whether this trend is expected to continue, or
                            whether it resulted from special circumstances.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary did not know the cause, but did not believe that the
                            September improvement was that great. Our Balance of Trade for the first
                            six months was in deficit, he said, and this year for the first time
                            since 1893 it was expected that the United States would run a trade
                            deficit. In a sense there had been some revaluation, with the Yen
                            floating upward some 9-1/2% and the Mark upward some 9%, all of which
                            helped, he said, toward balancing our payments, but these floats
                            amounted to less than what should be made. Politically and economically
                            he supposed that 24% would be difficult for Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked whether the United States would leave the
                            surcharge.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we would remove it, with adequate
                            revaluation.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister, almost thinking aloud, said that the 10% surcharge,
                            plus the float, almost equaled the Secretary’s figure.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that the situation might correct itself if the Yen
                            floated freely for a number of months, without government intervention;
                            realignment might thus become unnecessary.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister hoped that Minister of International Trade and
                            Industry <persName corresp="#p_TK2">Tanaka</persName> had explained what
                            a great effect the surcharge is having on Japan’s trade and economy; he
                            also hoped the Secretary understood the impact of the Yen float on
                            Japan’s export contracts, which had declined some 40%.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that Japan’s export customs clearance figures for
                            September and October didn’t show any appreciable decline.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that September was too early to show a decline,
                            which only began to show up in October.</p>
                        <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0571"/>
                        <p>To be fair, the Secretary wondered whether both nations could agree to a
                            relatively short bilateral arrangement, say for two years, with a
                            trigger point for reappraisal if the agreement turned out to be bad for
                            either side. He emphasized that he was thinking of a short term
                            arrangement, which would not lock either side into a precise long-term
                            position, because situations do change.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he would have more to say about Yen parity
                            later, but now wished to ask whether the United States is considering
                            any more voluntary restraint requests, similar to the one presented
                            through Ambassador-at-large <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">David
                                Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he hoped that it would not take three years to
                            negotiate trade liberalization, since the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> is on record with its own trade liberalization program.
                            There are a number of ways to correct the United States balance of
                            payments situation, he said, but at the moment there are no product
                            lines as urgent as textiles. However, he hoped that Japan would
                            accelerate its tariff reductions and relax its administrative restraints
                            as soon as possible. He then expressed appreciation for the Prime
                            Minister’s efforts to successfully conclude the textile agreement.</p>

                                    that we may not really want to proceed with negotiations.</p>

                                    Netherlands (now President of the Netherlands Bank and the Bank
                                    of International Settlements) who has been operating
                                    behind-the-scenes to see if he can suggest the elements of a
                                    deal with the Europeans that would have a reasonable chance of

                                <p>He brought up the gold price question and I told him of your
                                    strong views on this. On the question of zero or very limited
                                    convertibility, he was reasonably confident that this would not
                                    be a serious problem. On the gold price question itself, he said
                                    he hoped you understood that, with impending recessions and
                                    significant political (labor) problems in some of the key
                                    countries, it would be extraordinarily difficult for them to
                                    initiate a revaluation. He is, at the same time, aware of your
                                    political problem here and is working on a way of doing this
                                    through an <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>

                                    off any requirement for U.S. legislative action until after next
                                    year’s election. A very similar approach was worked on by my
                                    coordinating group and shows some promise.</p>
                                <p>While I agree completely that we have very little to gain at this
                                    time by indicating flexibility on this gold question, I think
                                    it’s going to end up being a “crunch” issue. Each percentage
                                    point of exchange rate realignment vis-à-vis the dollar improves
                                    our balance of payments (trade) by about 800 million dollars.
                                    If, indeed, the difference between some or no gold price change,
                                    or its equivalent, is 4% to 5% in overall exchange rate
                                    realignment, this issue could mean as much as 3 to 4 billion
                                    dollars difference in our trade account.</p>
                                <p>To sum up, I think you will soon have to decide whether you want
                                    the U.S. to adopt a more positive stance on the international
                                    economic negotiations. To repeat what I’ve said elsewhere in
                                    more detail, beginning a serious negotiating process does not
                                    mean, in my view, “caving in” and certainly does not mean
                                    accepting a “bad deal”. It does mean, however, conveying to the
                                    U.S. public and foreign countries that it is in our mutual
                                    interests to take positive steps to try to resolve this
                                    situation constructively.</p>

                                belonged to economic crisis which affected all these other issues.
                                He fears that if differences go unsettled for four or five months,
                                they will get wound up in internal politics, especially U.S.
                                elections, and will get out of control. There will then be
                                retaliatory measures on both sides, recession with further
                                diminution of defense budgets, and general dissipation of confidence

                            <item>Luns said under such circumstances exchanges of paper formulae
                                with Soviets on balanced force reductions would become complicated
                                and meaningless. Soviets will simply sit back to see what happens,
                                while Western Europeans make own trade and monetary arrangements and
                                relations with U.S. deteriorate. Luns said he thought necessary
                                precondition to progress on this issue was that France and <gloss
                                    target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should compose their present
                                differences. He also felt this matter was too crucial to be left to
                                financial technicians such as <persName corresp="#p_SK6"
                                    >Schiller</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1"

                            <item>Luns has therefore proposed to Germans in Bonn and to other
                                PermReps in Brussels that matter should be introduced on agenda for
                                NATO Ministerial Dec 8 to 10. He had at first envisaged (1) item
                                entitled implications of current monetary and financial problems for
                                Alliance, and (2) participation of MinFins in NATO meeting. But in
                                view of modus operandi of MinFins and danger of their getting
                                separated from context of main meeting, as well as personal problems
                                    (<persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName>-<persName
                                    corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName>), Luns thought it better
                                not to push for their participation. He also found it better to
                                water down terminology of item so it could be treated under heading
                                “state of Alliance” and thus avoid implication NATO was horning in

                            <item>Luns said he had discussed matter fully in Bonn and Brussels. He
                                had found Schmidt, Scheel and <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                    >Brandt</persName> very positive. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                    >Brandt</persName> was greatly concerned with problem and
                                reacted favorably to Luns proposal. (Chancellor also confirmed he
                                would meet with <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName>
                                before end November but was not very optimistic.) In Brussels Luns
                                said his approach had been generally well received with some

                                matters but he detected some signs of anxiety on their part over
                                continued crisis and consequences of rift with Germany. In any event
                                Luns concluded that he thought it imperative for SYG and NATO to
                                register strong concern so that by osmosis, urgency of situation as
                                it affected Alliance should get quickly to national govts even
                                though NATO could take no formal action itself.</item>

                                domestic and general economic reasons but I stressed need for
                                European action. I said I had spoken with officials in Washington

                                and had impression that some real European movement (even if not

                                present deadlock were to be broken. Luns agreed but said that press
                                and specially U.S. reporters were unduly playing up <gloss

                                British. On other hand he was dismayed by Danish decisions to cut
                                Navy and reduce troops to seven thousand and he anticipates rough

                            <item>I am increasingly concerned about the effect that prolonged delay
                                in resolving the international monetary crisis is likely to have on
                                our interests in France and in Europe, in the weeks immediately
                                following Aug. 15. The GOF behaved with restraint and in fact went
                                out of its way <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0577"/>to assure us

                            <item>In the last few weeks, however, I have detected a disturbing
                                change in the French attitude. Key French officials have begun to
                                warn us that, if we do not soon indicate clearly what our terms for
                                a settlement are, opinion will turn decisively against us, with
                                incalculable consequences for our political interests in Europe
                                (Paris 18571).2 Our British colleagues have told us they are
                                convinced that, if the next <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss>
                                Ministers’ meeting is unproductive, the French will lose hope of
                                reaching an agreement in that forum and will start considering
                                alternative possibilities (Paris 19092).<note n="2" xml:id="d197fn2"
                                    >Not printed.</note> Leading financial journalists like Alain
                                Vernay of <hi rend="italic">Le Figaro</hi> are increasingly critical
                                in their conversations with Embassy officers of what they describe
                                as US intransigence, and increasingly pessimistic about the future.
                                There have been disturbing signs recently that measures aimed at the
                                multinational corporations are being considered more and more
                                seriously by the French authorities.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The underlying cause of the French malaise is a growing feeling
                                that, by failing to indicate more concretely what our terms for a
                                settlement are, we are blocking a negotiated solution of the crisis.
                                Continued delay in settling the crisis has led to growing
                                uncertainty among French businessmen and is beginning to cause them
                                to defer important investment decisions. The effect the crisis is
                                having on Franco-German relations and on Germany’s economic
                                prospects is also a matter of growing concern to the GOF. Behind
                                these immediate concerns lies the deeper fear that if the crisis is
                                not ended soon nations will be increasingly inclined to take
                                defensive measures, with the resulting contraction of world trade
                                leading to a world recession.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The result of all this is a growing conviction among government
                                and business circles in France that a solution of the international
                                monetary crisis in any acceptable time frame (i.e., before US and
                                France are swept up in their respective elections campaigns), is no
                                longer possible. If this view becomes established GOF policy,
                                serious damage to important US interests seems inevitable.
                                Initially, this might take the form of action, presumably in concert
                                with France’s <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> partners, to protect
                                the French trade position through the adoption of special export
                                incentives and a more restricted policy toward US imports.</item>

                            <item>But as the atmosphere deteriorates, the French are likely to move
                                from protective measures to outright retaliation. The most obvious
                                area in which they could retaliate is foreign investment (about 10
                                percent of the $24 billion of US direct investment in Europe is in
                                France), since here <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0578"/>they
                                can act independently of their <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>
                                partners. They could adopt a much more restrictive policy on
                                approval of new investment requests (although this is unlikely so
                                long as they are not assured American investors turned down in
                                France could not go elsewhere in the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                    >EC</gloss>). More likely forms of retaliation would be (1)
                                restrictions against borrowing by US firms in overseas markets and
                                withholding of government-owned credit facilities in France and (2)
                                imposition of exchange controls to block multinational firms from
                                repatriating earnings. (In 1970, US firms repatriated $6.2 billion
                                in profits; about $100 million of them came from France.)</item>

                            <item>Another consequence of failure to get an early settlement of the
                                monetary crisis, as pointed out in Paris 19092, would probably be an
                                effort by the GOF to get a purely European agreement on a return to
                                fixed parities. This would not be in our interests, since one
                                feature of such an agreement would undoubtedly be some lowering of
                                the present level of the Mark relative to the dollar.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>Admittedly, the French position has not been helpful. The French
                                have adamantly refused to consider the revaluation of the franc, and
                                this has made it difficult for the Germans to agree to a higher
                                revaluation of the Mark. Their allegation that we have failed to lay
                                our cards on the table overlooks the fact that we have tried
                                unsuccessfully in WP-3 and the <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss>
                                to [gain?] acceptance of our estimate that we need a $13 billion
                                swing in our balance of payments to get us out of our chronic
                                deficit. French (and European) insistence on a small increase in the
                                price of gold injects a large element of inflexibility into their
                                position. The fact remains that today we are perilously near a
                                stalemate, and the longer this persists, the greater becomes the
                                danger that the French and the other Europeans will take measures
                                which will seriously damage important US interests on this
                                continent.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>This makes it essential, I believe, that the field play a far more
                                active role than it has been able to play so far in combating the
                                increasing pessimism and negativism of the French. To do this, we
                                will need more informative and timely guidance on our objectives in
                                the monetary crisis than we have been getting. In particular, we
                                must be better prepared to deal with the charge that the US has not
                                stated its objectives precisely enough to permit meaningful
                                negotiations. While this charge is unfair as applied to the
                                realignment of parities, it has considerably more substance as
                                applied to the trade side.</item>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I think you ought to know this: Unemployment in recent months has risen
                            in every foreign country belonging to the so-called “Group of Ten”;
                            namely, Belgium, France, Germany, Holland, Sweden, Switzerland, the
                            United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan. For some reason that eludes me, the
                            Italian figures on unemployment are ambiguous; but it seems clear from
                            other data, particularly on industrial production, that Italy is in
                            trouble.</p>
                        <p>I am by no means ready to conclude that an international recession has
                            begun. But the evidence at hand does seem to support the view that the
                            rate of growth of the outside economy is definitely slowing down. This
                            may have far-reaching implications for the kind of monetary and trade
                            settlement that we can work out with the outside world.</p>

                                outlined the type of agreement <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552"
                                    facs="0580"/>on international monetary problems which the <gloss

                                similar to those previously reported and stressed that in his view
                                the deteriorating economic situation in Germany and pressure for an
                                interim <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> solution would make it
                                impossible to arrive at even this type of agreement by the spring of
                                1972. If an agreement along the lines outlined is not acceptable to
                                the US, everyone, therefore, would have to make his arrangements for
                                a long period of non-agreement. The Bundesbank would have to start
                                to drive the appreciation of the Mark down to lower level. End

                            <item>Emminger said he felt that the postponement of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> meeting had been due to a great
                                misunderstanding by those (he specifically mentioned the Dutch) who
                                had suggested it to us. Actually, Europe was now as prepared as it
                                would ever be and it was in everyone’s interest to meet quickly and
                                if at all possible to settle the currency issue within the next six
                                weeks or so. With recessionary tendencies coming more and more to
                                the fore in Germany and elsewhere in Europe, it would be politically
                                impossible next spring for the European governments to settle on as
                                high a parity change vis-à-vis the dollar as they would be willing
                                to do now.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Emminger confirmed what we had previously heard in Bonn and what
                                has also been reported from London and Paris concerning the outcome
                                of the last <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Finance Ministers’
                                meeting. Giscard for the first time clearly indicated that France
                                would “hold still” for a modest dollar devaluation provided that the
                                UK and Italy also would “hold still” and the DM would appreciate by
                                5-6 percent vis-à-vis the French franc (always compared to the
                                pre-float parities). While <persName corresp="#p_EO1"
                                    >Emminger</persName> did not specify the degree of dollar
                                devaluation in such a package, he mentioned 6 percent “as an
                                example.” <persName corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName> said that
                                he had calculated that—assuming a 12-14 percent Japanese
                                appreciation (vis-à-vis the dollar, less vis-à-vis gold)—the kind of
                                package envisaged at the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Finance
                                Ministers’ private meeting would involve an average 9 percent
                                “devaluation” of the dollar. It would take some hard negotiations to
                                persuade the UK that the pound should “hold still” in such a
                                situation. Hard bargaining might also succeed in adding another
                                percentage point, or at the very most 2 percentage points, to the
                                average dollar “devaluation” versus other currencies. Finally, it
                                might be possible to get “something”, but not very much, on trade
                                policy and burden sharing (mainly in the form of promises to try to
                                work something out) as part of such a package and some agreement on
                                wider bands, continued dollar non-convertibility into gold, and on
                                the general direction of the reform of the international monetary
                                system (which, however, would take two years or so to work out and
                                agree in detail).</item>

                            <item>It was important for the Europeans to know if such a package was
                                acceptable to the US as a basis for the quick return to fixed
                                parities and <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0581"/>including the
                                dollar devaluation involved (and presumably also the removal of the
                                surcharge). <persName corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName> stressed
                                that in his opinion such a package was possible only if agreed
                                quickly. The business cycle situation would make it politically
                                unsaleable in Europe next spring. Germany, for one, could not wait
                                that long. While Germany was willing to see a 10 percent
                                appreciation of DM vis-à-vis the dollar, it could not continue to
                                accept such an appreciation vis-à-vis other currencies, and
                                particularly vis-à-vis the franc. French steel imports were already
                                causing serious difficulties and automobile imports were next.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> would not be in a
                                position to resist pressure for help from these two important
                                industries. In the absence of an agreement now, Germany, therefore,
                                would have to start to drive the DM rate of appreciation down from
                                its current level. <persName corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName>
                                professed great confidence that this would be done relatively easily
                                through monetary policy. He pointed to the present DM 19 billion
                                short term indebtedness of German industry abroad. By lowering the
                                German interest rate below those abroad, the Bundesbank could induce
                                the outflow of these funds and a consequent easing of the DM rate of
                                appreciation. The Bundesbank was reluctant to do this now because it
                                foresaw a 10 percent revaluation of the DM against the dollar in a
                                general settlement and this would be psychologically difficult if
                                the rate now dropped significantly below this. But in the absence of
                                a quick general settlement, the Bundesbank would have to
                                proceed.</item>

                                    >Emminger</persName> felt it would also be impossible to resist
                                a “European solution” now. Such a solution most likely would involve
                                an appreciation against the dollar considerably less than that in
                                the type of international solution outlined in para 3 above, with
                                some more controls and some very sticky and relatively small outside
                                flexibility. While <persName corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName>
                                felt that Germany could live with such a solution, it would be
                                definitely a second best from everyone’s point of view.</item>

                                had ever seen it. He was under vicious attack by the SPD left

                                Industry and the right were attacking him for a float. <persName

                                not be able to get a better deal by next spring than it could now.
                                If the US now indicated that the type of deal outlined in para 3 was
                                not acceptable (with minor improvements), then everyone would have
                                to settle down for a long period with no worldwide agreement and

                                    >Emminger</persName> urged that in looking at the deal, the US
                                bear in mind that: (A) wide margins would in effect make it possible
                                to increase the “dollar devaluation” 2-3 percent beyond the parity
                                changes agreed, and (B) the US “concession” of a dollar devaluation
                                in fact would work out to an advantage since it would increase the
                                value of our gold reserves. <persName corresp="#p_EO1"
                                    >Emminger</persName> said that all their reports and
                                conversations with visiting American bankers indicated that a gold
                                price increase had become much less of a political issue in the US,
                                and he hoped this would not be a stumbling block. It was the only
                                way by which Germany could upvalue 10 percent against the US without
                                also doing so against France, the UK and the rest of the <gloss

                                    >Emminger</persName> (protect) mentioned that while he realized
                                Congressman <persName corresp="#p_RHS1">Reuss</persName> was not the
                                US Congress, it was interesting that <persName corresp="#p_RHS1"
                                    >Reuss</persName> had told him that he, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RHS1">Reuss</persName>, could “guarantee” that
                                Congress would pass a dollar devaluation bill within two days,
                                provided it was vigorously supported by the administration and it
                                was part of a sensible package of international parity realignments
                                and at least some elements of international monetary reform. The
                                Financial Attache asked <persName corresp="#p_EO1"
                                    >Emminger</persName> whether he had the impression that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RHS1">Reuss</persName> would consider the
                                kind of realignment outlined in para 3 above as sufficient and
                                whether <persName corresp="#p_RHS1">Reuss</persName> would also
                                “guarantee” no Congressional amendments to an “insufficient”
                                package. <persName corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName> replied
                                that, of course, <persName corresp="#p_RHS1">Reuss</persName> wanted
                                a larger realignment, but with strong administration support and the
                                further flexibility provided by wide margins, he, <persName

                        <p>On or about November 18, 1971, the Office of Management and Budget and
                            the Department of the Treasury circulated papers proposing negotiating
                            strategies to resolve the international monetary impasse. A copy of the
                            8-page <gloss target="#t_OMB1">OMB</gloss> paper, dated November 16 and
                            entitled “Tactics for an Early Conclusion of the Surcharge Round,” was
                            sent to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> on November 18
                            at the request of Director <persName corresp="#p_SGP1"
                            >Shultz</persName>. The <gloss target="#t_OMB1">OMB</gloss> paper has

                            under cover of a handwritten note that reads: “<persName

                            Monetary-Trade-Burden Sharing Negotiations Over the Next Month.” It is
                            accompanied by a “Scenario” paper and Attachments A-I. A handwritten
                            note on the paper reads: “From Secretary Connally. Copy sent to HAK in
                            NY 11/20/71.” (Ibid.) Another copy of the Treasury paper is accompanied
                            by a November 22 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_HRD1"
                                >Hormats</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> entitled “Monetary-Trade-Burden Sharing
                            Negotiations,” which expressed the opinion that the paper was a
                            reasonable attempt at a position to remove the surcharge. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HRD1">Hormats</persName> recommended that “the main
                            elements to stress are that the surcharge is a wasting asset and that
                            the longer it is on the greater the likelihood that other countries will
                            compensate economically, that retaliatory measures will take place, and
                            negotiations for its removal will be more difficult.” (Ibid., Box 356,
                            Monetary Matters)</p>
                        <p>Both papers look to significant exchange rate realignments and trade and
                            burdensharing agreements. Neither considers restoring
                                convertibility.<gloss target="#t_OMB1">OMB</gloss> adheres to the
                            President’s directive that there be no increase in the price of gold
                            (see <ref target="#d189">Document 189</ref>), but Treasury, with a view
                            to France as the greatest obstacle to a successful negotiation,
                            reluctantly leaves open the door for a possible accommodation.</p>
                        <p>In his November 22 commentary on the <gloss target="#t_OMB1">OMB</gloss>
                            paper, <persName corresp="#p_HRD1">Hormats</persName> noted that if the
                            United States remained firm in its intention not to devalue the dollar
                            vis-à-vis gold, one outcome could be the U.S. purchase of francs with
                            dollars to push up the value of the franc relative to the dollar, a
                            unilateral declaration by the United States that the franc <pb n="556"
                                xml:id="pg_556" facs="0584"/>was revalued. If the United States
                            bought francs to increase the franc’s value and if France attempted to
                            maintain the original parity by using francs to buy dollars, the result
                            would be politically disastrous.</p>

                            (which is unlikely). These figures are not consistent with a $13 billion
                            adjustment … they are somewhat above a realistic appraisal of settlement
                            terms for most countries, and the Canadians will presumably only agree
                            to a float. Such a proposal thus appears to leave ample room for
                            realistic negotiation in comparison to a probable counter offer of 15%

                        </p>
                        <p>Since August 15, the yen has appreciated about 9-1/2%, but the overall
                            exchange rate change (in terms of our weighted <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                                >OECD</gloss> trade) has been only about 3%; since May 1, 1971, it
                            has been about 4-1/2%. This is well below the needed adjustment.</p>
                        <p>France has managed to avoid revaluation, at least on trade transactions,
                            and has enjoyed some depreciation relative to Germany and some other
                            competitors. Thus France, with some other countries, can bring pressure
                            on their trading partners. France, Japan, and some other countries have
                            instituted new controls. These conditions, together with the existing
                            uncertainty and fears of recession, limit the maneuvering room for
                            Germany and some other countries and increase the pressures for
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>The principal negotiating obstacle is the inflexible position of France,
                            its pressure on its immediate trading partners, particularly Germany,
                            and its emphasis on the gold price.</p>
                        <p>Despite a strong urge for an interim settlement evidenced by our leading
                            trading partners, especially Canada and Japan, and the general awareness
                            of a firmer U.S. position than we have taken in the past, there is still
                            an unwillingness or inability to recognize the size of the needed
                            adjustment, as we perceive it.</p>
                        <p>A continuing impasse, without an American initiative based upon a
                            proposal that can be publicly defended as “reasonable,” courts the risk
                            of increasing criticism of the U.S. for blocking agreement. If other
                            matters (i.e., the exchange rate realignment and trade and
                            burden-sharing issues) could be resolved, a strong effort is warranted
                            to unblock the opposing positions of the U.S. and France for an interim
                            settlement regarding gold.</p>

                            Procedurally, relying on emergency provisions of the <gloss

                            the New Economic Policy—specifically, conditions for removal of the
                            surcharge. There are several points which you might wish to make: <pb

                                <item>—It would be useful to view the international negotiations
                                    connected with the New Economic Policy in terms of two
                                    “rounds”—a surcharge round (in which we achieved conditions
                                    which would allow us to remove the surcharge), and a
                                    gold-convertibility round in which we achieved reform of the
                                    international monetary system and negotiated trade concessions.
                                    We should not expect in round one to achieve all we want in
                                    terms of exchange rate adjustments, trade, or defense burden
                                    sharing. Our objective should be to arrive at an interim
                                    solution which enables us to get a significant appreciation of
                                    exchange rates and some trade measures while remaining firm in
                                    our intention not to restore convertibility. With regard to gold
                                    we should be in a position to discuss raising the dollar price
                                    of gold and perhaps reach tentative agreement to do so but not,
                                    in any case, resume gold convertibility. Convertibility will be
                                    our major point of leverage in bringing about the exchange rates
                                    we want in the second round and in achieving major reforms of
                                    the international monetary system.</item>

                                        pressure on Europe to resolve the monetary situation in a

                                    <p>In the long run, Europe will probably be unwilling to take in
                                        large amounts of dollars and probably unable to maintain
                                        capital controls. It is thus likely that there will be
                                        pressure on it to float collectively against the dollar or
                                        to appreciate their currency values so that capital controls
                                        are unnecessary and they do not accumulate larger amounts of
                                        dollars. The one thing we should guard against is an <gloss
                                            target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>-wide dual rate system (which
                                        means one exchange rate for trade transactions—a commercial
                                        rate—and another presumably higher rate—a financial rate—to
                                        reduce the inflow of capital). Such a system would reduce
                                        the pressure on Europe to float their trade (commercial)
                                        rate upward, and thereby be counterproductive in our efforts
                                        to realize a trade surplus.</p>

                                    Europeans on the gold question, we must recognize that we will
                                    not get <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0591"/>the amount of
                                    dollar devaluation vis-à-vis the other currencies which we
                                    believe is necessary. France has stated that it does not intend
                                    to revalue the franc vis-à-vis the dollar, but instead wants the
                                    dollar to be revalued with respect to gold. If France will not
                                    revalue, Germany will probably reestablish the value of the mark
                                    at no more than 6 percent higher than the value of the franc (it
                                    is presently about 9 percent above the franc and dollar), and
                                    Japan will permit the value of the yen to rise no higher than 5
                                    percent above the value of the mark. These appreciations will be
                                    far less than will be adequate to bring about the improvement we
                                    seek in our balance of payments. (The value of the dollar is now
                                    approximately 3.5-4 percent below the overall value of the other
                                    major currencies as of April.) Treasury estimates that for every
                                    1 percent devaluation in the value of the dollar, our balance of
                                    payments improves by $800 million dollars. Thus, we should
                                    seriously consider measures to devalue the dollar, if possible,
                                    without having Congress involve itself in our negotiations, and
                                    without going back to convertibility.</item>
                                <item>—The negotiations should be handled in such a way that we do
                                    not attempt to play one European country off against another.
                                    Any scheme to deal harshly with one European will lead all
                                    Europeans to believe that we are attempting to split the Common
                                    Market countries, and is likely to lead to a severe reaction in
                                    Europe. Throughout these negotiations we should consider the
                                        <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> as one entity and, while

                                    of retaliatory actions, and the U.S. will be increasingly viewed
                                    as a “scapegoat” for Europe’s economic woes. This will certainly
                                    make negotiations difficult, and it will be less easy for us to
                                    accomplish our economic objectives.</item>

                                    present problem, and the more vulnerable they are to the
                                    importunements of those who wish to develop a European position
                                    counter to our interests on economic issues, and
                                    political/security issues as well.</item>
                                <item>—We should be careful not to demand too much in the area of
                                    trade. Other nations feel that we have as many restrictions on
                                    imports of their products into this country as they do on our
                                    products. And, they view trade as an area in which reciprocal
                                    quota and tariff reductions should be negotiated, not as an area
                                    in which countries should make unilateral concessions. (The
                                    Common Market feels especially strongly about this, while Japan
                                    seems somewhat less reluctant to move unilaterally <pb n="564"

                                    may be able to get some concessions, and the promise of
                                    negotiations on a number of issues, we should not make removal
                                    of the surcharge contingent upon a long list of major
                                    concessions from other nations.</item>

                        <p>On November 23 and 24, 1971, the President had several meetings with his
                            economic advisers. He was scheduled to travel to San Clemente on the
                            evening of November 24, and this was his last opportunity to take up
                            international economic policy with his advisers before <persName

                        <p>According to a tape recording of their meeting on November 23, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> told the President he would
                            have a bilateral meeting with the Italians before the <gloss
                                target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> Ministerial and would seek bilaterals
                            with the Japanese and Canadians as well. <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> said the international matter could be settled
                            and it was only a question of how much to give. He repeated what he had
                            told the President on October 28 (see <ref target="#d187">Document
                                187</ref>), that currency realignment alone would not be too
                            meaningful to the average American. <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> wanted agreement on trade issues as well, which
                            would be politically important to the President. He nonetheless agreed
                            with the President’s recap of his position that a monetary deal would
                            have to be concluded before a trade deal, which would take a long time,
                            particularly because of European difficulties in negotiating on
                            agriculture, which <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> had
                            discussed with Ossola earlier that morning.</p>
                        <p>The President asked for <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                            >Connally</persName>’s views on gold before <persName corresp="#p_SGP1"

                            came in (they never arrived at this meeting). <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> said, “gold is a crucial
                            point. The French have a phobia on gold.” <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> gave the President a lengthy explanation of
                            issues and possible magnitudes of changes in exchange rates between the
                            dollar and other currencies, and among the other major currencies, and
                            summarized Ossola’s presentation that morning that if the United States
                            changed the price of gold and removed the surcharge, the Community would
                            be willing to discuss trade. <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> said, and the President agreed, “the real money
                            is in the realignment, but the politics are in the trade issue.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> thought the United
                            States was in an excellent negotiating <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565"
                                facs="0593"/>position and said he would hate to bargain away both
                            gold and the surcharge for an inadequate realignment package. He
                            considered the possibility of having Volcker, prior to the <gloss
                                target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> Ministerial, perhaps in a press
                            conference or during a Deputies meeting, indicate that the United States
                            was prepared to submit to Congress a bill to increase the price of gold
                            in return for a 17 percent revaluation of the yen, etc., and would
                            remove half the surcharge now and the remainder once a package of trade
                            concessions had been agreed upon. <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> did not believe gold was important
                            domestically, but advised the President against giving in to <persName
                                corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> without getting something in
                            return. The President agreed, and thought the gold issue might be held

                            three agreed that they, along with <persName corresp="#p_SGP1"
                                >Shultz</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName>,

                                >Peterson</persName> should not be included; and that Connally’s
                            proposal should not go beyond their limited group. The President was
                            inclined to reserve on gold at the <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss>
                            Ministerial, and instead take it up with <persName corresp="#p_PG5"

                            work it out with <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> who
                            would need something from the Summit. <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> outlined his approach to the Rome meetings:
                            “All we have to do is make progress. We can both make proposals the
                            others cannot accept. The fact of the meetings will maintain the

                            is good, and the President was clearly told there would have to be some
                            change in the price of gold. All three also agreed there had to be some
                            progress in Rome.</p>

                        <p>During the conversation the President reported on the announcement that
                            morning of the schedule of Summits, including the Azores Summit with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> “to wrap up
                            this whole thing.” Concerning the gold price and convertibility, the
                            President told Burns, “you, John and I should get the tactic together
                            for the luncheon.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> told the President that
                            he and <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName> had discussed the
                            international economic issues at breakfast that morning. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> said he suggested trading the
                            surcharge for a 17 percent revaluation of the yen, etc., but that Burns
                            had “wisely” advised against giving specific percentages for particular
                            currencies, which would reveal the U.S. bargaining position. Instead,
                            once the others in the <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> make an
                            inadequate offer <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> would
                            counter with a proposal for an average realignment of perhaps 11 or 12
                            percent. Pursuant to the President’s sentiments, they agreed that at
                            that stage they could not touch gold, but in view of the French position
                            on gold they eventually would have to give something on the gold price.
                            Burns said he was “convinced” they could not get a settlement without
                            giving something on the gold price.</p>
                        <p>The President returned to the question of convertibility. Burns and
                            Connally, at some length, explained why, for technical reasons, the
                            United States would have to agree to provide limited amounts of reserve
                            assets from time to time—gold, <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s, or
                            something else—but that would not be restoring convertibility in the
                            traditional sense. During their explanation of the technical reasons,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> revisited the gold
                            price question and said that if the United States were to increase the
                            price of gold, it should be “our deliberate decision,” unrelated to
                            procedures in the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, and the
                            administration should submit it to Congress for its action. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> said convertibility would
                            come up in the <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> meeting, but the
                            important issue was the realignment and, politically, all that could be
                            achieved on trade. He dismissed the other matters as “nickels and dimes
                            stuff.” The President said he would like to get something on offset as
                            well, but in the end would rather get something from Germany on trade.
                            If press questions about their luncheon arose later that day, the agreed
                            line was that the President thought it important to have progress in
                            Rome. Principles would be agreed on there for consideration by higher
                            authorities. (Ibid., Recording of Conversation Among President Nixon,

                        <p>At the Economic Policy Committee meeting of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                                >OECD</gloss> in Paris last week two matters emerged that are worth
                            calling to your attention.</p>
                        <p>First there is growing concern among the major industrial nations about
                            their own domestic economic conditions, and this does have implications
                            for the exchange rate appreciation, relative to the dollar, that we can
                            expect from them. As they become more worried about rising unemployment,
                            they will tend to become less generous about the appreciation they will
                            accept—with its adverse effect on their international competitive
                            position relative to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Because of these growing domestic economic concerns, these countries will
                            tend to pursue more expansionist monetary policies. This is particularly
                            true in Germany, where not too long after the turn of the year, easier
                            monetary policies can be expected. In private conversations they made
                            this clear to me. As these occur, international monetary flows will be
                            induced that will tend to move the exchange rate of the D-mark downward.
                            It is not reasonable to expect the Germans to agree to any change in the
                            exchange rate pattern which would require their moving the D-mark
                            exchange rate up above its then present level. Their exporters are
                            already bringing heavy pressure to bear on the German government because
                            the D-mark appreciation is giving their exports an increasingly hard
                            time in world markets.</p>
                        <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0596"/>
                        <p>The clear implication of these developments is that the exchange rate
                            adjustments we can expect from other industrial nations are apt to be
                            smaller as we move beyond the turn of the year.</p>
                        <p>Second, a pro-American French line<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">On another
                                copy of the memorandum the President circled this phrase and in the
                                margin wrote: “K-note.” (Ibid.)</note> was evident at the meeting.
                            Traditionally in these Economic Policy Committee meetings the French
                            delegation could be expected to flay the American position at some point
                            in the deliberations. This time any intimation of any anti-American
                            comment from the French spokesman was conspicuous for its complete
                            absence.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, at his initiative, I had dinner (at Laserre) with M. Jean Rene
                            Bernard, Economic Adviser to President Pompidou. This dinner was at M.
                            Bernard’s initiative, and he came to the dinner from having been in bed
                            with the flu. I know him well enough for a serious conversation, but not
                            well enough for him to have arranged a purely social evening. The dinner
                            was, therefore, presumably arranged for him to communicate a basic
                            message.</p>
                        <p>M. Bernard also took the same intensely pro-American line. While this
                            might be dismissed as tactical, I believe it was more than that. The
                            French do seem genuinely worried about the political implications of a
                            continued international monetary problem. For one thing, he considered
                            it quite important that the <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss>
                            meetings November 30 and December 1 should at least start the process
                            for an orderly solution in order that the Pompidou-<persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> meeting on December 3 would not
                            take place against the backdrop of a continued international monetary
                            impasse. He also expressed the view that if this could be resolved, the
                            United States could then resume its overall international leadership
                            without which, in his judgment, it might be difficult for European unity
                            to survive.</p>
                        <p>He was cool to “regional” solutions (including a European regional
                            system), and not optimistic about their workability. And he seemed
                            concerned about longer-run relationships between France and Germany.</p>
                        <p>I pass these observations along because they may be pieces of a larger
                            jigsaw puzzle that carry implications beyond economic policy in the

                                    <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> meeting on November 24,
                                Belgian FinMin Snoy told Charge he saw a possibility of substantial
                                progress at <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> meeting in Rome if
                                U.S. were agreeable to modest devaluation of dollar. Otherwise he
                                foresees a deadlock which would force the Europeans to seek their
                                own solution, beginning with the Pompidou-<persName
                                    corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> meeting. Snoy expressed
                                concern that the deteriorating economic situation in many countries
                                including Belgium would make it increasingly difficult for
                                governments to meet U.S. desires. It was, therefore, urgent to reach
                                agreement soon. Snoy believed that settlement of exchange rate
                                question would still leave the problem of dealing with the
                                convertibility of the dollar. He also recognized existing problems
                                in the trade field which needed to be discussed. In response to
                                Snoy’s defense of Community proposal for <gloss target="#t_EFTA1"
                                    >EFTA</gloss> non-applicant members, the Charge said that

                                24 to seek Belgian thoughts on forthcoming <gloss target="#t_G101"

                            <item>Snoy said he thought it best public posture to approach this
                                meeting without too much expectation. He was nevertheless deeply
                                concerned by the dangers of the present situation. He referred to
                                the deterioration of the economies of Germany, Belgium and
                                elsewhere. This deterioration increases protectionist pressure on
                                governments and makes it more difficult to make adjustments desired
                                by the US. He mentioned that increasing unemployment in Belgium and
                                a sharp drop in investments were reflected in the success of recent
                                Belgian state loan.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Snoy, therefore, sees urgency of early agreement. He was confident
                                that such an early agreement would be possible if it could include a
                                modest devaluation of the dollar by perhaps 5 percent. If that were
                                impossible there would be a deadlock in Rome. He said that some
                                progress on the European position had been made in Versailles, but
                                this had more to do with the procedure than with the substance.
                                Further steps would depend on the <gloss target="#t_G101"
                                    >G-10</gloss> meeting. Regardless of what happens <pb n="570"
                                    xml:id="pg_570" facs="0598"/>Snoy thought that some progress on
                                the first stage of the Werner Plan would have to come out of the
                                French-German meeting. Furthermore, if there were no success in
                                Rome, the urgency of the European situation might well make
                                essential an ad hoc European solution in the monetary area and the

                            <item>Snoy thought that even if agreement were reached on exchange rates
                                there would still be the question of convertibility of the dollar.
                                He foresaw that the need would continue for foreigners to accept
                                dollars even if agreement were reached. He did not see how a
                                solution of this problem would be possible without discipline of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. For example, central banks
                                would not hold dollars without some assurance through <gloss
                                    target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> on their value and usability. He
                                asserted that US Treasury had so far resisted <gloss
                                    target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> discipline such as had been
                                accepted by the British.</item>

                            <item>On the degree of flexibility that would be required he thought it
                                depended on the degree of realignment. The closer the realignment to
                                US desires the less flexibility that would be required.</item>

                            <item>Charge referred to the question of trade. He stressed that an
                                outward looking attitude by the Community on a number of questions
                                such as grain stocks, agricultural prices, and citrus fruits, would
                                be useful over the short run. Snoy was sympathetic, but
                                noncommittal. He suggested that if the dollar were devalued it would
                                be helpful to the Community on agricultural prices. This would make
                                it possible to retain the unit of account and make it easier to
                                resist protectionist pressures that would otherwise emerge in
                                establishing a new unit.</item>

                            <item>While he recognized that <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>
                                non-applicants were a problem, Snoy pointed out that Community could
                                not increase “boundaries” on trade between former <gloss
                                    target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> members. The Charge responded
                                that the US is not interested in creating such new “boundaries” but
                                at the same time does not believe that the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                    >EC</gloss> reconciliation with the <gloss target="#t_EFTA1"
                                    >EFTA</gloss> should result in new hurdles for US trade. He
                                stressed that US ability and willingness to accept new elements of
                                discrimination had greatly changed over the last 10 or 15 years, and
                                more active attention by Europe to third-country interests would be
                                in order.</item>

                                continue to seek a quick, world-wide solution. The Foreign Office
                                has stressed, in this regard, that a quick solution will avoid a
                                confrontation with the US which might otherwise develop, and will
                                prevent a long delay in resolving issues which, if left open much

                                relations in the wrong direction. The Foreign Office insists that

                                something on the trade side. We are told that the Germans are
                                optimistic the French would go along. From our side, the Europeans
                                need an indication that the US also wishes a quick world-wide
                                solution and that the US is prepared to make a contribution itself
                                to this end.<note n="2" xml:id="d206fn2">Earlier in the day the

                                Foreign Office has also reflected a positive attitude toward the
                                limitation of price increases in the agricultural sector; towards
                                helpful agricultural storage policies; and towards a reciprocal
                                trade package in industry. We are told that what is needed, however,
                                is concrete US trade proposals which would “thereby put the ball

                            Ministers’ meeting.</p>
                        <p>No specific action suggested now at your initiative, but following is for
                            your use as appropriate.</p>
                        <p>On August 15 the President launched his New Economic Policy designed to
                            restore vitality to our economy at home and competitiveness to our goods
                            abroad. Our international financial position had deteriorated to the
                            point where we were not able to sustain our policy of redeeming dollars
                            for gold, necessitating the painful decision to suspend gold
                            convertibility. In addition, the President’s announcement provided an
                            opportunity to intensify our efforts to foster trading practices which
                            would improve market access to U.S. goods as well as to the goods of
                            other countries.</p>
                        <p>Immediately following the President’s August 15 statement, we commenced
                            intensive negotiations with our trading partners to achieve the exchange
                            rate realignment necessary to restore equilibrium to the U.S.
                            international financial position. At the same time contacts regarding
                            outstanding trading issues were intensified. Many of these trade issues
                            such as those with Canada and Japan are best pursued bilaterally, and
                            that is what has happened. With respect to the Economic Communities, we
                            have proceeded with discussions in Brussels and Washington.</p>
                        <p>There is a close interrelationship between the exchange rate realignment
                            and trading practices if the latter tend to vitiate the increased
                            competitiveness which exchange rate adjustments are designed to achieve.
                            Most importantly, the Common Agricultural Policy could well operate to
                            deny to our agricultural exports any benefit which an exchange rate
                            adjustment would otherwise provide. Likewise, the extension of the
                            preference system to a broader area of trade further compromises the
                            most favored nation principle. Already a major portion of world trade is
                            conducted at preferential duty rates, and the portion is increasing. We
                            believe at this critical turning point in financial and trading
                            relationships, we must press for reconsideration of the trends in these
                            areas.</p>
                        <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0601"/>
                        <p>We recognize that these are difficult and contentious issues involving
                            practices which have developed over the years and that they are not
                            given to easy solutions. But we must impress upon other governments that
                            the time has come to reverse trends which prejudice our trading
                            position, not only because of economic importance but because political
                            support for liberal, outward looking policies in U.S. is dependent on
                            visible evidence of improved treatment. The United States believes that
                            with the exchange rate realignments and monetary questions now under
                            negotiation, opportunity must not be lost to make progress on trade
                            front as well.</p>
                        <p>European governments strongly wish to separate monetary and trade issues.
                            The United States recognizes that the compartmentalization of financial
                            responsibilities and trade responsibilities in the organization of
                            governments, including the U.S. Government, and international
                            institutions have impeded joint negotiations in the past. Thus, we are
                            concerned that lack of progress on trade matters, particularly with
                                <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>, could block acceptable general
                            settlement. However, desire for monetary settlement should encourage
                            willingness to examine trade issues if European governments understand
                            movement in trade area (particularly greater recognition of interests of
                            other countries in <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss>) is necessary
                            part of settlement.</p>
                        <p>Our position is consistent with communique of <gloss target="#t_G101"
                                >G-10</gloss> Finance Ministers, meeting in Washington on September
                            26, which referred to “some other measures outside the exchange rate
                            field designed to improve the U.S. balance of payments.”</p>
                        <p>Specifically, the U.S. Delegation to the <gloss target="#t_G101"
                                >G-10</gloss> Ministers’ meeting in Rome on November 30 will be
                            seeking to advance the negotiations on trade matters, with particular
                            emphasis on agricultural matters in the EC. (Bilateral discussions with
                            Japan and Canada are reasonably well advanced.)</p>
                        <p>We believe <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> Finance Ministers will be
                            generally more sympathetic with our concern over <gloss target="#t_CAP1"
                                >CAP</gloss> than other elements in <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss> governments. However, because these matters are not
                            normally in the jurisdiction of Finance Ministries, it is important the
                            weight we attach to these matters be kept in mind in your contacts with
                            host governments.</p>

                                professes not to have any hard-or-fast views about outcome of next
                                week’s <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> Ministerial. He thinks
                                that if U.S. were prepared to undertake small devaluation of dollar
                                against gold, general rate realignment would fall into place fairly
                                easily. He is more concerned about several questions that would
                                arise once new rate structure decided: width of support margins;
                                responsibility for defense of new parities as between U.S. and other
                                countries; appropriateness of U.S economic policies as means of
                                consolidating new dollar parity. Embassy officers stressed to
                                Wormser that any settlement satisfactory to U.S. would of necessity

                                of Bank of France today for reading of his views on international
                                monetary situation on eve of Rome <gloss target="#t_G101"
                                    >G-10</gloss> Ministerial next week. Wormser professed not to
                                have any hard-or-fast feelings about what might happen at Rome. He
                                commented that even if U.S. were prepared make “contribution” to
                                parity realignment by small devaluation of dollar against gold, it
                                was by no means clear to him that Secretary <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> would be willing to play
                                this “trump card” next week. If it was true—as alleged this morning
                                in private newsletter published in Paris—that the Secretary was
                                making plans for new meetings of Group of Ten in January, it would
                                appear that in U.S. thinking, settlement of monetary problem was
                                still some distance away.</item>

                            <item>Wormser remarked that assuming small U.S. “contribution,” general
                                rate realignment should fall into place fairly easily. In his
                                opinion, of far greater importance, and far more difficult to
                                answer, were several questions as to what would follow decision on
                                new rate structure. <list>

                                    <item>What would be width of margins around which new parities
                                        would be defended? This seemed to Wormser a question on
                                        which views diverged widely from country to country. In
                                        particular, Six did not see eye to eye, and certainly U.S.
                                        and French positions were quite far apart.</item>

                                    <item>Who would be responsible for defending new parities? If
                                        U.S. continued to take position it had no responsibility
                                        therefor, this problem would be pushed back on other central
                                        banks, which would face possibility of having to accumulate
                                        additional unwanted, inconvertible dollars, since it was
                                        clear that massive U.S. deficit would not go away overnight.
                                        In other words, when exchange markets started operations
                                        under new rate structure, what, if anything, would Federal
                                        Reserve be prepared to do to defend parity of dollar in New
                                        York exchange market, as Bank of France and other central

                                        “orthodox” economic and financial policies? When we asked
                                        Wormser what he meant by “orthodox policies,” he referred to
                                        reports that U.S. <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972

                                        was an example of what was not “orthodox.” No currency
                                        devaluation had ever been successfully consolidated where

                                and trading practices. We said U.S. delegation to Rome meeting would
                                specifically be seeking to advance negotiations on trade matters,
                                and that only a settlement which gave sufficient weight to this
                                aspect of balance-of-payments problem would be satisfactory to U.S.

                        <p>You asked exactly what we would get out of a willingness to devalue. The
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>’s answer is as follows: the U.S.
                            will get a substantially larger total exchange rate alignment since
                            certain countries which agree to hold their exchange rates at present
                            levels if the U.S. devalues by 5% or so, would not take the initiative
                            and the political heat of revaluing on their own—even if the economic
                            effects are the same. Also, certain countries (like Germany) are deeply
                            concerned about their relative position <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577"
                                facs="0605"/>vis-à-vis other countries (like France). Thus, the less
                            the franc/dollar rate changes, the less Germany will do vis-à-vis the
                            dollar.</p>

                        <p>Various experts estimate that each additional percentage point of
                            exchange rate realignment gets the U.S. an additional $800 million of
                            positive trade effect. Thus, since a change in the dollar price of
                                <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>s or gold reportedly buys us an
                            extra 5% total realignment, it means about a $4 billion improvement in
                            the U.S. trade picture. When you recall that our total 1971 basic
                            balance of payments deficit is something over $8 billion, the gold price
                            issue could be decisive.</p>

                            discussion, is in the Washington National Records Center, Department of

                            Meeting 11/30-12/1/1971. Section I of the paper was drafted in
                            Secretariat format and may be Chairman Ossola’s draft of his prepared
                            remarks for the opening of the <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss>
                            Ministerial on November 30. Section II is presumably a U.S. draft of
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName>’s response to Ossola
                            and remarks of other Deputies following <persName corresp="#p_VPA1"
                                >Volcker</persName>’s intervention.</p>
                        <p>Section III of the paper, entitled “Comments on <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> Statement of U.S. Substantive
                            Position,” is the U.S. record of the Deputies’ debate about releasing
                            the U.S. position. “After the <persName corresp="#p_VPA1"
                                >Volcker</persName> statement, including his intention to make the
                            statement public, all of the other nine delegations expressed the view
                            that publication of a formal U.S. statement before the Ministers met
                            would inject an element of inflexibility into the U.S. position that
                            would change the whole atmosphere of the discussions. The French, in
                            particular objected to the last sentence of paragraph 5 dealing with no
                            dual markets, mentioning this passage as not appropriate in light of the
                            forthcoming <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> meeting…. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> argued that the U.S. statement
                            was an attempt to put forward a reasonable, realistic position that met
                            the desires of others for the U.S. to be more specific. The U.S. was
                            concerned that parts of the U.S. position would be leaked in an
                            unfavorable light. The position had to be seen as a package.” The paper
                            that <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> presumably gave the
                                <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> Deputies was transmitted to the

                            No other paper that might have been the text of that proposal was found

                        <p>On November 30 Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>
                            met with Prime Minister Colombo and Treasury Minister Aggradi at 9 a.m.,
                            prior to the <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> Ministerial that would
                            convene later that day. Colombo said that he understood the United
                            States had distributed a document to the <gloss target="#t_G101"
                                >G-10</gloss> Deputies the previous day. Subsequently, Aggradi
                            returned to that point and said “the document distributed by the U.S.
                            yesterday has caused concern to all the Europeans. The document seems to
                            broaden the debate back to general principles rather than focusing it on
                            specific problems. He was afraid that when the Ministers of the Six
                            would meet at 11:00 A.M. that morning they would be very reticent to go
                            forward with the idea of presenting their common proposals to the <gloss
                                target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> meeting.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> replied that “he could
                            not agree that the United States’ document was broadening the issues. We
                            have been consistent from the very beginning in holding that the areas
                            for discussion were three: currency realignment, trade issues and burden
                            sharing. It is true that up to now we have not been very specific on
                            trade and burden sharing because we were afraid of being put in the
                            position of seeking to dictate to others. However, the United States has
                            been taken to task as being overly silent, and thereby of obstructing
                            negotiations, because it did not put forward specific proposals. Now
                            that we have been more specific there are objections because we have
                            done so. What is the European position then? Do you want us to be
                            specific or don’t you?”</p>
                        <p>As the discussion concluded <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> made two points: “First of all, he recognized
                            that the <gloss target="#t_G101">G-10</gloss> was not the ideal forum
                            for tackling questions of trade and burden sharing. Yet it was after all
                            true that the ultimate decision on these matters rests with heads of
                            government and not with individual ministers and the decisions could
                            therefore be expressed in this forum. Secondly, in a philosophical vein,
                            he wanted it understood that in these times of fast change the United
                            States is deeply committed to continuing and to strengthening free trade
                            policies. We are strongly concerned that the existence of various
                            international entities such as the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>,
                            the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> are not
                            always coordinated and tend to impede the solution of problems. In a
                            fast moving age, when problems arise we cannot afford to be bogged down
                            by hide-bound institutional arrangements or by considerations of pride
                            and prestige of nations or heads of State.” The memorandum of the
                            conversation is in the Washington National Records Center, Department of

                        <p>For seven months, our trade position has been in deficit by some $3
                            billion at an annual rate, calculated <gloss target="#t_FOB1"
                                >FOB</gloss>. (Calculated CIF on imports as is the practice of many
                            other countries, the deficit rate would approximate $7 billion.)</p>
                        <p>Based upon earlier discussions and information available to us at this
                            time, the principal trading partners of the U.S. apparently do not
                            contemplate exchange rate and other actions that would permit adjustment
                            commensurate to the forecasted need. At the same time, there is a
                            widespread desire to achieve a prompt settlement of outstanding issues
                            in a manner that will permit elimination of the U.S. surcharge and more
                            fundamentally provide an environment in which trade and payments can
                            proceed with reduced controls and greater certainty.</p>
                        <p>In the interest of expediting such an early settlement, the U.S. is
                            making an integrated set of proposals to the Ministers of the Group of
                            Ten countries.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. proposals must be considered an integrated package. They are
                            based on the presumption of no change in the official dollar price of
                                <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0609"/>gold; in the present
                            position of the U.S., there can be no presumption of convertibility of
                            the dollar into reserve assets, nor is the U.S. in a position to offer
                            exchange guarantees. United States policy also continues to be based on
                            a presumption that its present restrictions on capital outflows will
                            also be eliminated over time, and that some liberalization steps are
                            anticipated shortly.</p>

                            November 30-December 1, 1971, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> was under some pressure about the issue of the
                            gold price. At a December 2 White House Staff Meeting, which was not
                            attended by the President, <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>
                            spoke as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Problem. <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> offered
                            devaluation of the dollar and it now appears Arthur is winning on
                            convertibility. These are both firmly opposite to the President’s
                            directions [see <ref target="#d189">Document 189</ref>]. We now have
                            changed the price of gold and the problem is how we get this through
                            Congress. The price of gold doesn’t matter if it is not convertible, but
                            the real problem of devaluing is in the Senate and now everything hangs
                            on this and we have to have Congressional authority.</p>
                        <p>“Question. Is <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> doing this
                            under pressure of the meeting?</p>
                        <p>“Now back to a procedural problem. What are we doing? What is our policy?
                            Change in the price of gold is now irretrievable. How do we make it an
                            asset and market it through the Senate?” (<persName corresp="#p_HHR1"

                            price issue, Hormats wrote: “given events in Rome, I have sent <persName
                                corresp="#p_PPG1">Peterson</persName> a ‘line’ on gold which I have
                            cleared through Treasury” and which “should bring <persName

                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Question:</hi> What is the U.S. position on the price
                            of gold?</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> The U. S. delegation to the Rome meeting
                            of the Group of Ten made no offer or commitment regarding a change in
                            the official dollar price of gold. However, in discussion of various
                            hypothetical changes in exchange rates, moderate increase in the
                            official gold price was mentioned by the delegation. We have made clear
                            that we don’t want to see an emphasis on gold in the monetary system,
                            and have been opposed to a change in the price of gold for that reason.
                            Several other countries do want a change. The question is whether such a
                            change would contribute to a better all-around solution—and we haven’t
                            seen the evidence on that.</p>
                        <p>“Certainly it should be clear we do not intend to resume convertibility
                            into gold.</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Question:</hi> Has the U.S. offered to devalue the
                            dollar by raising the price of gold, in order to help solve the monetary

                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> No. At the Rome Meeting, the U.S. took
                            the position that we could accept an average exchange rate adjustment of
                            11 percent provided it was accompanied by progress on trade and burden
                            sharing. To facilitate discussion, alternative methods of achieving
                            adjustment of that magnitude were discussed in a purely hypothetical
                            way. Neither the U.S. nor any other country made any offers or any

                                    This commitment followed prolonged <gloss target="#t_EC1"

                                    Barre, who was present, was asked directly if he understood the

                                    action should be taken to ratify action but that negotiation
                                    would indeed begin immediately.</p>

                                <p>You should be advised of this considered commitment which was
                                    critical part of the Rome meeting. It was an ingredient
                                    essential to the progress that was made there. It is an
                                    ingredient essential to future progress.</p>
                                <p>It is of the utmost importance that no USG official reflect any
                                    doubt whatsoever on this commitment. Since commitment made in
                                    executive session without written record we want to be alert to
                                    any possibility of <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> bureaucracy
                                    dragging its heels on trade through procedural delays and
                                    otherwise, particularly in view of public view recently
                                    expressed by the Commission representatives that trade
                                    negotiations would have to await interim monetary settlement. We
                                    have been assured by the FinMins of the Six that any such
                                    statements by the Commission have been totally unauthorized.</p>
                                <p>For your background, extensive discussions in executive session
                                    identified the following trade areas of prime interest to the
                                    U.S. in the short run: most-favored-nation treatment of citrus;
                                    tax harmonization scheme on tobacco; 10% grain stock piling for
                                    2 crop years; and the common support prices for grain, including
                                    both the unit of account and the inflation factor. We also look
                                    for framework for negotiation on other areas, such as
                                    preferences and farm price policy, during 1972. Mr. <persName

                                in the Community’s internal procedures and (B) to avoid

                                Council of Ministers. The Commission would have to make a proposal,
                                have it vetted at the official level with the member states (Perm
                                Reps and Article 113 Committee), and have it formally approved by

                                for next Saturday, December 11. Provided that the member governments
                                give the necessary political directives, the normal Community
                                procedure can be speeded up and telescoped at least in part. We are

                                this called in essence for 5-1/2 percent devaluation of dollar and
                                weighted average revaluation of major currencies against dollar of
                                11 percent over 1970 parities. This formula modified during
                                discussion to permit possibility of deeper dollar devaluation and
                                use of May 1, 1971 as base date for 11 percent revaluation (i.e.
                                require that 11 percent be over and above Canadian revaluation of 8

                            <item>Discussion then centered on <persName corresp="#p_ZJ1"

                                    >Zijlstra</persName> said he developed after extensive
                                discussions with all Governors and Ministers involved, would call
                                for dirty float currencies (UK, France, Italy and Sweden) to
                                maintain gold parity (i.e. revalue by 5-1/2 percent against dollar),
                                Germany, with weight of 10 percent in US imports, to revalue by
                                12-15 percent against dollar, Japanese, with weight of 19 percent,
                                to revalue by 15-20 percent against dollar, and Benelux to revalue
                                halfway between “dirty four” and D-Mark, i.e. 8-10 percent. No one
                                flinched audibly at this formula, including Dutch, but it was soon
                                obvious that unless Canada, with weight in US imports of 25-36
                                percent (depending on definition) is in position to contribute
                                additional 4 percent more in revaluation, other countries would have
                                to push their revaluation to <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0616"
                                />unacceptable levels to reach US 11 percent target. Monetary
                                discussion terminated at this point and discussion on trade ensued

                                will and strong desire to achieve immediate settlement of monetary
                                and trade issues. Dutch, who have so much to lose from international
                                trade war, clearly share this will and desire. <pb n="589"
                                    xml:id="pg_589" facs="0617"/>Although Dutch are deeply concerned
                                about present downward trend in their business cycle, which up to
                                now has been due to excessive wage settlements, they are even more
                                fearful of growing atmosphere of corporate uncertainty engendered by
                                floating exchange rates. Their improving <gloss target="#t_BOP1"
                                    >BOP</gloss> outlook for 1970 gives them little comfort because
                                it is due more to declining imports of investment goods than to
                                rising exports (except to Germany). Thus we are inclined to believe
                                that they would now settle for guilder revaluation in terms of
                                dollar of as much as 11 percent, provided this is essential to
                                agreement and provided D-Mark revaluation is at least 3 points
                                higher.</item>

                                the markets around the world. By restricting discussion to only the
                                principals, a very lively and free give and take was achieved. This
                                procedure is likely to continue in Washington.<note n="2"

                            <item>On Monday afternoon, Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VPA1"
                                    >Volcker</persName> at the Deputies meeting made a specific
                                proposal incorporating a substantial concession by the United
                                    States.<note n="3" xml:id="d216fn3">See <ref target="#d211"
                                        >Document 211</ref>.</note> Our analysis has determined that
                                a roughly <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0618"/>$13 billion swing
                                is needed if we are to return to approximate equilibrium in our
                                basic position. This would involve, in the absence of other
                                measures, an exchange rate adjustment on the order of 15-20 percent.
                                Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> said the U.S.
                                could accept an 11 percent adjustment (figured from May 1, 1971),
                                provided it was accompanied by progress on trade (particularly
                                agriculture) and burden sharing. However, because the adjustment
                                proposed was below what is likely to be necessary for a secure
                                external position, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VPA1"
                                    >Volcker</persName> emphasized the offer was based on a
                                presumption of no convertibility into reserve assets and no change
                                in the dollar price of gold. It was pointed out the U.S. could not
                                assume responsibility for maintaining exchange rates when other
                                countries would agree to substantially less change than what we felt
                                was necessary to achieve equilibrium.</item>

                            <item>The U.S. was prepared to publish this offer, but withheld at the
                                unanimous request of other Deputies.</item>

                            <item>On Tuesday the Common Market Ministers and the U.K. sought a
                                common position and, as previously, they were able to agree mainly
                                that the U.S. should offer to change the gold price.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>To facilitate discussions on various formulas for achieving the
                                exchange rate realignment the U.S. proposed discussion proceed in a
                                hypothetical manner by asking what exchange rate changes might ensue
                                with the U.S. changing the gold price in various ways. The ensuing
                                discussion (and silences) made it apparent that despite the strong
                                politically motivated desire in Europe for a gold price change, most
                                European countries desired only small and inadequate exchange rate
                                adjustments. It was apparent to all in the discussion that the U.S.
                                could not unilaterally determine its exchange rate by any
                                mechanism.</item>

                            <item>No country made a specific offer. Each nation has maintained its
                                full prerogatives and future negotiations will proceed with all
                                options open. However, each of us is now more intimately aware of
                                not only the range of possibilities but also of likely magnitudes of
                                adjustment.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>As reported to you earlier, much time was spent in firmly
                                establishing the point that trade measures must be part of the
                                solution. We left Rome having created a strong momentum for a
                                monetary settlement. However, large differences of substance remain.
                                I cannot predict that settlement will be found in Washington. Too
                                much depends on the trade negotiations, the prospect of which is
                                difficult to assess at this time. Moreover, it is clear that
                                exchange rate realignment which many countries are prepared to allow
                                us is substantially below the minimum requirement which Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> announced Monday
                                of 11 percent and also below what the <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                                    >OECD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> studies
                                have considered necessary. So in Washington I hope to find that the
                                other countries have raised their sights a bit. In sum, the sense of
                                progress which the press has <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0619"
                                />reported and which the markets have reflected are justified. I
                                hope it will be possible to have agreement by early in the New Year.
                                However, to achieve that result, the time has come in which our
                                trading partners must be more forthcoming than has been apparent so
                                far.</item>

                                Council was unable at its meeting on December 11 to adopt a formal
                                mandate to the Commission to begin trade negotiations with the
                                United States. Instead, the Council adopted a “declaration of
                                intent” (text not available) which stated that the Community should
                                open negotiations with the US “as soon as possible.” The Counsel

                                a formal mandate, and said that the Commission should report to the

                                before negotiations can actually begin. This could be accomplished,
                                however, by “written procedure,” which would not require a meeting

                            <item>The “declaration of intent” adopted by the Council also states

                                Minister Ferrari-Aggradi at the Rome meeting of the Group of Ten.

                            highlighted its economic differences with the United States. He included

                            p.m. to review non-economic issues, accompanied only by their
                            interpreters (Walters on the U.S. side). Simultaneously, Secretary

                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> (according to the President’s

                            reports that <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> was also
                            present (according to <hi rend="italic">White House Years,</hi> page
                            961), and <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> agreed to
                            provide <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> with a proposal
                            for <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>’s breakfast meeting
                            with <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> the next day.</p>
                        <p>On the afternoon of December 13 Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName>
                            met from 3:35 to 6:13 p.m. (accompanied by interpreters and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> on the U.S. side). The
                            majority of the discussion entailed an exchange of views on
                            international monetary and related matters. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> emphasized the importance of
                            fixed parities, a devaluation of the dollar in relation to the price of
                            gold, and the eventual restoration of convertibility. The Presidents
                            touched on acceptable exchange rate margins and target parities for a
                            number of currencies, subjects they <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596"
                                facs="0624"/>took up in greater detail on December 14.

                            political meeting and the <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"

                            economic meeting continued. That evening both Presidential parties
                            attended a dinner given by Portuguese Prime Minister Caetano.</p>
                        <p>On December 14 <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> again
                            breakfasted with <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> to
                            discuss monetary reform and related matters. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> worked from a draft set of undertakings drawn
                            up in consultation with <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                            >Connally</persName>, which he marked up during the breakfast meeting.
                            See <ref target="#d220fn1">footnote 1, Document 220</ref>. Presidents

                                corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> then met from 9:35 a.m. to 1:35
                            p.m. (accompanied by interpreters and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> on the U.S. side) for detailed discussion of
                            monetary and related matters. At 11:05 a.m. <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_VPA1"

                            (according to the President’s Daily Diary) plus <persName

                                >Schumann</persName> (according to the memorandum of conversation)
                            joined the Summit and remained with their principals until the
                            conclusion of the meeting. Following exchanges on a number of specific
                            issues, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> if he could agree
                            with the general terms of the U.S. draft. <persName corresp="#p_PG5"
                                >Pompidou</persName> equivocated, suggesting there was room for give
                            and take. The memorandum of conversation does not further elaborate on
                            an agreement, but the Presidents did sign a confidential agreement on a
                            framework for a monetary and trade settlement. See <ref target="#d220"

                        <p>In their brief statements at the end of the Summit both Presidents
                            referred, without any specifics, to wide-ranging discussions, but the
                            joint statement released at that time referred only to the economic
                            issues. The December 13 remarks of Secretary Rogers and Foreign Minister

                        <p>A number of high-level French officials, including President Pompidou,
                            have expressed concern about continued decline in value of the
                                dollar.<note n="2" xml:id="d222fn2">In a brief telegraphic message
                                Ambassador Watson advised the Department of State that President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> had taken him
                                aside at a dinner <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName>
                                hosted for Chiefs of Mission on January 15 to express concern over
                                the international monetary situation and his hope that the
                                understandings reached with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                    >Nixon</persName> in the Azores with respect to the dollar could
                                be fully carried out. (Telegram 1250 from Paris, January 20;
                                ibid.)</note> They have indicated that while it was clear to them at
                            the Azores that the U.S. could not return to convertibility at this
                            time, it was expected that the U. S. would act to maintain the strength
                            of the dollar at the new parity. In their view, low U.S. interest rates
                            are forcing dollars abroad in order to push up the value of other
                            currencies and push down the dollar’s value. (Between January 7 and 21
                            the Swiss franc appreciated by 1.1 percent, the Belgian franc by 1.5
                            percent, the French franc by 0.8 percent, and the guilder by 1.7
                            percent.) If the outflow of dollars continues, and our low interest
                            rates, and the expectation of continued inflation resulting from the
                            large budget deficit announced by the President have led some to believe
                            that it will, pressure will increase on France and other European
                            countries to purchase dollars in order to keep the value of the dollar
                            from depreciating further within the “band” set as the result of the
                            Smithsonian Agreement.<note n="3" xml:id="d222fn3">Nearly a month later,

                        <p>France may see a sinister plot behind our actions. A number of the
                            officials fear that they are the work of Secretary Connally, and others
                            who believe that the realignment agreed upon in Washington was not large
                            enough. If this distrust of our moves is not rectified, it is bound to
                            cause political friction. Moreover, if the dollar outflow continues,
                            thereby widening the difference between the value of the franc and the
                            dollar, <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> could be prompted
                            to reconsider whether to devalue the franc. This would completely

                                        we want for the future.” He cautioned against pressing too
                                        hard on broad trade issues. (Ibid., Subject Files, Box 402,

                        <p>Given the fact that the low interest rates are primarily the result of
                            large increases in the monetary supply necessary to boost our domestic
                            economy, it is highly unlikely that <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Arthur

                            attempt to raise interest rates at this time merely to satisfy the
                            Europeans. However, it is necessary to restore European confidence that
                            we intend to carry out the Smithsonian Agreement by requesting of the
                            Congress in the very near future (pending the desired trade concessions)
                            the precise amount of dollar devaluation we are committed to seek and
                            that we will press the Congress to pass this legislation without any
                            deviations from that Agreement. There must also be a show of confidence
                            in this country that the realignment agreed upon by the Smithsonian was
                            completely satisfactory and that we expect it to result in an
                            improvement in the U.S. balance of trade and payments. Without a display
                            of commitment and confidence, the Europeans will continue to distrust
                            our motives. Speculation against the dollar may again grow to
                            significant proportions, and the entire Smithsonian Agreement may come
                            apart.</p>

                        <p>At the time of our meeting at the Azores, we reached agreement on two
                            texts, namely an official communique and a document intended, in
                            principle, to remain confidential.<note n="2" xml:id="d223fn2">
                                <ref target="#d220">Document 220</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the essential fact in my opinion is that our conversations of
                            December 13 and 14, 1971, were characterized by a frankness and mutual
                            understanding that were particularly useful on account of the very
                            general character of most of the problems which were raised.</p>
                        <p>It is notably within this framework that the international monetary
                            problems were touched upon in a more technical and precise fashion.
                            Without doubt, it was impossible in our brief conversations to discuss
                            these questions in detail. Nonetheless, very important accords were
                            concluded on numerous points.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons, I feel obliged to describe to you more than six weeks
                            after our conversations my uneasiness with regard to the evolution of
                            the international monetary situation. I should like to call your
                            attention to certain shortcomings which risk weakening the correct
                            implementation of our agreements as well as to my preoccupation over
                            steps taken or of positions envisaged by your administration and which,
                            at first glance, do not seem to me to be consistent with what we
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p>First, however, I would of course not permit myself to pass a judgment on
                            your internal economic policy. I know that you have obtained remarkable
                            results insofar as the movement of prices and salaries are concerned.
                            Nevertheless, I am not confident that the combination of a large
                            budgetary deficit and of a policy of systematically low interest rates
                            can strengthen the confidence of the international financial community,
                                <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0633"/>always very sensitive. Nor
                            do I believe such a course affords in the best of circumstances for the
                            defense of the new parity of the dollar which you yourself have
                            fixed.</p>
                        <p>At the time of our Azores conversations, I well understood that there was
                            no question of the complete convertibility of your currency. But I did
                            indicate to you that if you agreed to control the movements of capital,
                            initiate a system which would permit the consolidation of dollar
                            balances and also the defense of your currency, the dollar balances
                            notwithstanding, this would in effect mean a convertibility from
                            currency to currency.</p>
                        <p>I also told you that I understood very well that you insisted on
                            refraining from an official and immediate declaration but that all these
                            things were understood. [I also said] that failing these steps there
                            would be no real defense of the dollar and it would become necessary for
                            the Federal Reserve Board to defend your currency by exchanging it, if
                            need be, against other currencies.<note n="3" xml:id="d223fn3">Brackets

                                we would defend the dollar.” At the conclusion of <persName

                                it. President <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> replied

                                conversation with <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName>,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> opened the
                                discussion noting that he had talked with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> and thought <persName

                                    corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> said “he had found someone
                                who had firm ideas. He had said that the U.S. would defend the
                                dollar after devaluation.” <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName> replied that “he understood what President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> was saying. After
                                talking to him he had spoken to the President and the President’s
                                view is that when we speak of defending the dollar, as he understood
                                it, we are talking about what happens in the new monetary system.
                                The President believes that as long as there is the expression on
                                our part that is what President <persName corresp="#p_PG5"
                                    >Pompidou</persName> described as defending the dollar, but
                                President <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> seemed to
                                feel that there were others. Leaving aside the present balances, the
                                way to defend is to buy when it falls.” In the ensuing discussion
                                President <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName> said “he
                                understood that the present dollar balances would not be included as
                                they were too big. The President apparently felt we were thinking of
                                something else. “ <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                                replied “that his impression after talking to Secretary <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> is that the Secretary
                                feels if the exchange alignment is correct then we will be prepared
                                to operate the system.” <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName> then read <persName corresp="#p_PG5"
                                    >Pompidou</persName> item 6 of the draft Framework Agreement,
                                with <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>’s formulation
                                on “what we were prepared to do as part of a general package on
                                margins and rates.” See <ref target="#d219">Document 219</ref>. For
                                the Framework Agreement, see <ref target="#d220">Document
                                220</ref>.</note> that in the new monetary system the dollar would
                            be defended pursuant to the methods that I had described; that it
                            appeared evident that there was no <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606"
                                facs="0634"/>other method and, not counting the existing dollar
                            balances, the new methods on which agreement had been reached
                            represented in a way a form of convertibility.</p>
                        <p>In any event, these intentions have not for the moment come into play
                            since, on the money markets, the dollar is not at its support level and
                            the problem therefore has not posed itself for the United States to
                            defend its currency as any other country would, by intervening to
                            preserve the dollar rate within the margins defined by the Washington
                            accords.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the reversion of floating capital towards the United States
                            which you and I expected has not yet occurred, perhaps for psychological
                            reasons but also because of the interest rates that prevail, in
                            practice, in your country. Moreover, the widening of the dollar margins,
                            which was decided in Washington following our meetings, gives
                            speculators the possibility to realize more substantial gains in capital
                            without a new modification of the parity of your currency.</p>
                        <p>You yourself proposed setting the enlargement of these margins of
                            fluctuation at 2.25 percent on either side of parity which represented
                            on your part, as on mine, an important sacrifice in relation to our
                            initial positions of principle. Therefore, I could not fail but note
                            that in the report of your advisors which accompanied the message you
                            addressed to Congress on January 27 on budgetary and economic
                                problems,<note n="5" xml:id="d223fn5">The President’s “Annual
                                Message to Congress: The Economic Report of the President,” dated
                                January 27, is printed in <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the

                            note was made of a growing consensus in favor of greater flexibility in
                            exchange rates. This does not seem to conform to the undertakings that
                            were reached between you and me. I would add that the experience of the
                            last six weeks gives me reason to believe that, setting aside these
                            formal considerations, the above mentioned remark (by the President’s
                            advisors) does not correspond to a clear analysis of the present
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>You must no doubt be impressed to see the extent to which we Europeans
                            are directly interested in the strength of your currency. This is true
                            because it is evident that it would be disastrous for the international
                            monetary system and thus for the entire free world should the accords of
                            December, whose historic character you yourself noted, become only a
                            precarious pause along the path towards a new crisis.</p>
                        <p>The central problem of course remains that of your balance of payments,
                            which, all things being equal, one cannot expect with certainty to
                            correct in a short period of time. For that reason I suggested to you
                            that you increase your controls on the movement of capital. You
                            indicated <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0635"/>to me that you were
                            initiating certain measures in this regard which were not substantial,
                            but that you were ready to go further. This course would have clearly
                            improved the situation of your balance of payments, and therefore the
                            level of the dollar on the exchange markets. It was for this reason that
                            I was surprised to see not only that nothing has started in this
                            direction, but that the Treasury of the United States has—at a moment
                            where for psychological and technical reasons, it would seem necessary
                            to improve confidence in the dollar—postponed from December 31, 1971 to
                            February 29, 1972 the date at which the subsidiaries of American
                            corporations established abroad must repatriate their profits. Such a
                            measure taken at such a moment does not appear to me consistent with the
                            objectives we set.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, I would add that you provided me with certain details about the
                            procedure, which you obviously are alone competent to judge, that you
                            intended to pursue with respect to Congress regarding the legal
                            devaluation of the dollar. You also indicated to me in this connection
                            that you would convene the Committee Chairmen with a view to speeding
                            consideration of a bill which, according to you, was desirable since the
                            Congress was adjourning immediately after the conclusion of our
                            conversations. Thus have I welcomed with all the more pleasure the
                            February 3 notification from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard

                            this text to the Congress.</p>
                        <p>I wish in closing to emphasize the point that my concerns are those of a
                            friend, that the prosperity of the United States and the maintenance of
                            the value of the dollar are of fundamental importance for the entire
                            Western world, and I would thus be happy if you could dispel these
                            concerns which I have very freely brought to your attention in the
                            spirit of our good conversations of 13 and 14 December, 1971.</p>
                        <p>Please, my dear Mr. President, accept my highest regards.</p>

                                <ref target="#d223">Document 223</ref>.</note> I have wanted to
                            consider that important communication with care and now, just before my
                            departure, I should like to reply in the same spirit of candor and
                            friendship which you displayed in your message. I assure you that I
                            remain convinced that maximum mutual understanding between us on these
                            difficult issues is essential.</p>
                        <p>I recognize the force of the concern you express that the prosperity of
                            the United States and the stability of the dollar are important to the
                            entire Western world. I also can well appreciate that, viewed from
                            abroad, the high level of our prospective budgetary deficits in the
                            United States could raise questions. Yet, viewed in the perspective of
                            economic conditions in the United States and in the framework of our
                            total economic policies, I am convinced these deficits are appropriate.
                            To a considerable extent, the new forecast of a higher deficit in the
                            current fiscal year is merely the reflection of reports received since
                            our meeting in the Azores, indicating slower growth than had been
                            estimated earlier for the second and third quarters of 1971. The slower
                            growth in those quarters leads automatically to an expectation of lower
                            tax receipts in the first half of 1972. In part, however, the new
                            forecast of a higher deficit this year is the result of a purposeful
                            acceleration of Government expenditures to provide some needed impetus
                            to nudge the economy on to a more satisfactory recovery path. Under the
                            circumstances, I believe the deficit is of an appropriate size not just
                            in the context of our domestic needs but in terms of a broader view of
                            the evolution of the monetary system and the world economy.</p>
                        <p>You have emphasized that the prosperity of the United States and the
                            value of the dollar are of fundamental importance to the Western world.
                            I agree, and I believe the force of the point is redoubled at a time of
                            sluggishness and even fear of recession in some important countries.
                            Steadily <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0637"/>rising levels of
                            business in the United States will help assure growth in markets for our
                            trading partners—and confidence in that growth—even as the effects of
                            the currency alignment are absorbed.</p>
                        <p>As our joint press statement at the Azores (as well as our private
                                communication)<note n="3" xml:id="d224fn3">
                                <ref target="#d220">Document 220</ref>.</note> emphasized, the most
                            important contribution the United States Government can make to the
                            stability of the monetary system and the defense of the newly fixed
                            structure of exchange rates is through vigorous efforts to restore price
                            stability and productivity to the United States economy. Without
                            reviewing all the details of our present programs, I assure you that
                            these fundamental objectives remain the basis of our domestic policies.
                            We shall break the back of inflation in the United States. We shall seek
                            new breakthroughs in productivity growth. These steps seem to me the
                            indispensable backbone for any realistic defense of the dollar.</p>
                        <p>This defense will have many facets. New tax measures and new regulatory
                            approaches have been adopted to spur productivity. To assure that the
                            economic expansion is accompanied by further progress toward price
                            stability, we are maintaining our price and wage controls, and I have
                            requested of the Congress a firm expenditure ceiling for fiscal year
                            1973 at a level only 4 percent above this year’s expenditures. This will
                            assure that revenues come into line with spending as the slack in the
                            economy dissipates.</p>
                        <p>In view of the objectives of our total economic program, I have been
                            pleased to receive reports that the Organization for Economic
                            Cooperation and Development, in the meeting in Paris of its Economic
                            Policy Committee a few days ago, found general accord with its forecasts
                            that, in 1972, the United States will succeed both in having the most
                            satisfactory recovery of economic growth and in having the lowest level
                            of price inflation of any of the major member countries.</p>
                        <p>As we see the coming months, our forecast budgetary deficit will insure
                            that we do not have to place undue reliance on monetary policy for
                            promotion of economic expansion. Indeed, the financing of the deficit is
                            likely to force some increase in short-term interest rates, to which
                            international exchange markets are sensitive. I frankly hope this
                            adjustment can be made without disturbing our long-term rates, which
                            remain high. But my advisers tell me that conditions in a number of
                            countries abroad are likely to lead to a reduction in their interest
                            rates, a development which will reduce present disparities in interest
                            rates among major countries.</p>
                        <p>In view of the major disturbances which were experienced during 1971, we
                            have recognized that the foreign exchange markets could not be expected
                            to return immediately to entirely settled and normal attitudes. <pb
                                n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0638"/>For this reason, since December
                            18, we have refrained from any steps to relax our controls on capital,
                            despite the doubts I expressed to you as to their effectiveness and
                            usefulness and despite my strong wish to move away from these controls
                            as promptly as possible. The small technical change in our regulations
                            which you mention in your letter had actually been announced some days
                            before our meeting in the Azores. Our general objective remains,
                            however, the gradual relaxation of these controls, and we must, within
                            the coming weeks, announce the details of our direct investment control
                            program for the calendar year 1972.</p>
                        <p>In the light of conditions in the exchange markets in recent weeks, I
                            believe we are fortunate that our compromise has permitted a wider band
                            of fluctuation to absorb and diffuse movements of funds without
                            requiring large scale central bank intervention. I confess that your
                            concern over the comments on flexibility in the recent report of my
                            Council of Economic Advisers surprises me in the light of our
                            conversation, since I believe we both recognized this question would
                            need to remain an open issue for the planned discussions of the future
                            of the international monetary system. Similarly, I believe that I made
                            clear in our conversation that it is our view that questions of
                            convertibility of the dollar should be discussed in the context of broad
                            consideration of the many inter-related aspects of future reform of the
                            monetary system. Now, however, that the period of intensive short-term
                            trade discussions is behind us, we are intensifying our deliberations
                            and preparations within the United States Government for these important
                            international deliberations on monetary reform, including various
                            proposals for the consolidation of dollar balances, the desirability and
                            feasibility of various measures to deal with short-term capital
                            movements, and the appropriate exchange rate regime.</p>
                        <p>To assure the maximum accomplishment in these discussions, and to help
                            deal with current issues of monetary cooperation as they arise, I have
                            asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> and his
                            staff to remain in close consultation with your advisers in the months
                            to come.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, you played a crucial role in preparing the ground for the
                            Smithsonian Agreement. With transmittal of the formal request for dollar
                            devaluation to the U.S. Congress, this should be a time of personal
                            satisfaction to you.<note n="4" xml:id="d224fn4">Legislation to increase

                        <p>By contrast, in the United States there was some concern that European

                            another possible forum, but monetary reform was not obviously part of

                            raise hackles in the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. With an eye to

                            some sentiment, clearly reflected in Samuels, February 22 memorandum to
                                <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Volcker</persName> and the March 20

                            discuss a U.K. paper on international monetary reform. The paper and the
                            discussion were wide-ranging and included liquidity creation and
                            distribution, an aid link, convertibility, and gold. Regarding the forum
                            for discussions, the paper noted that the “discussion cannot be
                            restricted to a small group of developed countries. Arrangements must be
                            made for the developing countries and others outside the Group of Ten to

                        <p>On March 11, 1972, Ambassador Watson sent a telegram to the Department of
                            State on the subject of “French Reaction to International Monetary
                            Developments Causing Growing Strain on Franco-American Relations.”
                            Following a summary the opening paragraph read: “With <pb n="614"
                                xml:id="pg_614" facs="0642"/>increasing frequency and virulence,
                            media here have been criticizing US for A) ‘benign neglect’ re
                            international position of dollar; B) failure support dollar devaluation
                            with appropriate monetary and fiscal policies, as evidenced by our large
                            budget deficits and low interest rates; C) unwillingness to commit
                            ourselves to even partial return to convertibility; and D) indifference
                            to problems caused for Europeans by their role in defending new exchange
                            rate structure.” Ambassador Watson thought none of these criticisms
                            well-founded but emphasized they were not limited to the press and had
                            been made by a number of official and non-official contacts in Paris. He
                            recounted steps the Embassy had taken to counter the arguments, but
                            concluded with the recommendation that the time had come “for more
                            intensive high-level US effort to counter European charges that US is
                            indifferent to fate of dollar.” He also recommended making clear that
                            the United States was “fully committed to continued cooperation with
                            them in interest of restoring stability to the system and indeed
                            improving it.” (Telegram 4718 from Paris; National Archives, <gloss

                                <item>A set of discretionary sanctions that encompass both capital
                                    and current account transactions. The adjustment committee
                                    should be free to decide whether the sanctions should be
                                    permissive, recommended or mandatory, depending on the degree of
                                    support in the committee for the imposition of such sanctions.
                                    One sanction would be the imposition of a tax on all purchases
                                    of a currency, and a subsidy on all sales of such a currency.
                                    Alternatively, restrictions could be imposed on all foreign
                                    exchange transactions along the lines of the scarce currency
                                    provisions of the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Articles

                                    account, the committee should be able to recommend specific
                                    restrictions on current accounts or capital account

                                    judgments regarding the adjustment required in the balance of
                                    payments positions of individual members. Ideally, such criteria
                                    would also provide the basis for a scale of reference that could
                                    indicate the degree of disruptiveness of a given country’s
                                    failure to adjust. One possibility would be to establish a set
                                    of bands based on reserve holdings of members. There is some

                        <p>1. While the main task would no doubt be the reform of the international
                            monetary system, there was a consensus that the future equilibrium of
                            the world economy was also dependent on adequate trade rules, on rules
                            for the responsibilities of surplus and deficit countries respectively
                            (“burden-sharing” in the widest sense, as well as burden-sharing in the
                            narrower sense of sharing aid and military burdens), rules on capital
                            flows, etc. The U.S. representative mentioned also the relationship
                            between the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> as a possible subject of review and
                            reform. The close linkage of reform of the monetary system with other
                            problems was generally acknowledged. However, there was a prevalent
                            opinion to the effect that the preparatory work for solving the totality
                            of these problems could not be entrusted to one single group but had to
                            be delegated to several bodies.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">II. Group of Twenty</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. There was general agreement that a new “Group of Twenty” (G 20) should
                            be the main forum for discussing the reform of the monetary system. This
                            Group should be set up by a decision of the Board of Governors of the
                            Fund as a special committee of Governors of the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss>. Its composition should correspond to the regional
                            composition (the “constituencies”) of the Executive Board of the Fund.
                            The Managing Director of the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> would
                            be an ex-officio member. Switzerland could participate as an
                            observer.</p>
                        <p>3. There would be one chief representative for each constituency (and
                            possibly one or two alternates). The Group would elect its own Chairman.
                            As the Governor’s Committee would hardly be able to assemble frequently
                            and undertake the detailed work, a committee of deputies would have to
                            be established which would prepare the work <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620"
                                facs="0648"/>of the Governor’s Committee. The idea was mentioned
                            that the Chairman of the deputies should perhaps work on a full-time or
                            nearly full-time basis and he should be assisted by adequate staff.</p>
                        <p>4. The terms of reference would request the G 20 to prepare proposals for
                            reform of the monetary system. This could also include rules for
                            balance-of-payments adjustment, for capital movements, etc. Adequate
                            reference should also be made in the mandate to the close linkage with
                            some non-monetary problems. The G 20 should be authorized to draw not
                            only on the work and staff of the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                            but also on other international organizations and on work done outside
                            such organizations. The Group would submit its proposals to the Board of
                            Governors of the Fund who would decide upon them.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">III. Other international organizations</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. It was emphasized that trade negotiations would fall within the
                            competence of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, and that any
                            proposal for changes in trade rules would also have to be acted upon by
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>6. It was recognized that the so-called “non-monetary problems” could not
                            be thoroughly dealt with by the Group of Twenty which would mainly be
                            occupied with problems of the international monetary system. There were
                            suggestions that these “non-monetary problems”—and also rules for the
                            respective responsibilities of surplus and deficit countries and for
                            capital movements—could be discussed, and proposals could be worked out,
                            by appropriate committees of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>.
                            To this end, existing <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> groups could
                            be re-structured, or a new <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> group
                            could be established. The <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> would
                            enter the picture only as a forum for preparatory discussion and it
                            would submit its proposals to the appropriate organizations.</p>
                        <p>7. The Group of Ten should have no specific mandate for participating in
                            the preparation of monetary reform. It should continue within its
                            narrower mandates in the framework of the <gloss target="#t_GAB1"
                                >GAB</gloss> and in the consultation procedure for <gloss
                                target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> allocations. It was left open whether
                            it should be used also for other tasks of coordination among the major
                            industrial countries.</p>
                        <p>8. Several participants in the discussion in London emphasized that the
                            work to be done in G 20 or in other groups should in no way impinge on
                            the competence and work of other international organizations.</p>

                                was first exchange of views without commitment. Deputies generally
                                favored short allocation period, two years being most frequently
                                cited. Views on amount varied rather widely from zero through
                                “token” and “modest” to normal (i.e., approximately 3 billion <gloss
                                    target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> rate of first allocation period).
                                U.S. leaned toward normal and indicated that if there were a zero
                                allocation in 1973, it should be followed by 3 billion <gloss
                                    target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> creation in 1974. Little support

                                projections re future reserve needs. <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                    >IMF</gloss> had calculated that global reserves at end March
                                1972, totaling 125 billion <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>, were
                                about 15 or 20 billion <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> in excess
                                of needed reserves. Extrapolating from three historical data series
                                (global reserve growth, ratios of reserves to imports, and ratios of
                                reserves to money), <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> estimated
                                global reserve needs in 1977 in range of 150-185 billion <gloss

                                over next five years. <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>

                            <item>In discussion on <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> projections,
                                several Deputies emphasized that creation of reserves in other forms
                                was very important element. There was, however, general recognition
                                of difficulties in estimating this factor. Chairman suggested that
                                perhaps <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> creation could be
                                corrected year by year as function of reserve creation in other
                                forms. Several speakers also expressed doubts about whether or not
                                future <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0653"/>needs could be
                                extrapolated from past experience, citing possibility that reformed
                                monetary system might be one that could be operated with lower level
                                of global reserves than in past. Brossolette (France) and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_EO1">Emminger</persName> (Germany) both questioned
                                whether or not any past period could be assumed to be one in which
                                there was equilibrium between need for, and supply of, reserves.
                                While questioning assumptions in this particular exercise, Oort

                                        considered for essentially political rather than economic
                                        reasons, but that an alternative would be simply to defer
                                        decision until economic need clearly emerged. U.K. favored
                                        “modest” amount (2 billion over two years). Italy suggested
                                        “disguised token” creation, which would consist of zero
                                        allocation for first year and 2 or 3 billion in second.
                                        Canada, Japan and Sweden favored “normal” amount, described
                                        as rate of creation during three-year period now ending.
                                        While preferring normal creation, U.S. said it could
                                        understand reasons why some countries advocated zero
                                        creation for one year; in that case, however, would want to
                                        see creation at normal rate of around 3 billion in second

                                outflow was accelerating. The Prime Minister concluded that this

                        <p>The cause of the speculative run on the pound has been the decline during
                            the past several months of Britain’s visible trade balance from a
                            healthy surplus to no surplus, the competitive prospect associated with
                            entering the European Community, and the recent threat of a dock strike.
                            The action is taken, however, when Britain’s current technical position
                            in terms of reserves and balance of payments had been considered
                            relatively strong.</p>
                        <p>The British action shows the wisdom of U.S. refusal to consider
                            convertibility until a new and stable monetary system is in place. The
                            European community announced two months ago narrower bands for exchange
                            rate parities between currencies of the ten members. These good
                            intentions did not prevail against the massive movement of short-term
                            funds, as the community had devised no mechanisms to give economic
                            validity to the new parities. The central banks of the members did
                            attempt to support the pound, with the Germans having bought $500
                            million worth on Thursday. It will be interesting to see to what extent
                            the other central banks continue to support the pound.</p>
                        <p>The British action will have some negative effect on the U.S. balance of
                            payments, undoing to some extent the effect of the December

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>Thank you very much for your personal messages with respect to your
                            decision on the pound.</p>
                        <p>I share your conclusion that this latest episode in a series of monetary
                            crises over recent years illustrates the need for fundamental changes in
                            the monetary framework. To the extent this point is generally grasped,
                            the cause of practical reform will have been reinforced—and, I hope,
                            speeded. This can be a highly constructive by-product of otherwise
                            unfortunate turbulence. I particularly welcome your reaction because so
                            much of my own concern in the period since last August 15 has been
                            directed toward establishing the point that we need to go beyond a
                            simple patching up of the Bretton Woods system.</p>
                        <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0658"/>
                        <p>Frankly, we have felt the point has not been generally accepted in the
                            past, even though certain underlying problems—such as the large mass and
                            volatility of short-term money that you mentioned—have become
                            increasingly evident.</p>
                        <p>I recognize that our effort to focus thinking on underlying problems
                            could be, and has been, interpreted in some public discussion as an
                            attempt to block or delay progress on specific reform proposals, or to
                            promote purely national goals. Yet, I have accepted that risk in the
                            firm belief that the cause of lasting reform—serving the needs of
                            all—will be advanced only by a willingness to face up to the fundamental
                            issues, political as well as economic. Any other course invites failure.
                            It is often said that a crisis is required to focus our minds and
                            energies. I am confident we have within our power the ability to grasp
                            this opportunity.</p>
                        <p>I am the last to underestimate the difficulties ahead. In a situation
                            permitting different avenues of approach and with success totally
                            dependent upon a sense of shared responsibilities and benefits, we have
                            not felt it useful to press for a specific single “American plan”.
                            Similarly, I trust that European thinking will not become frozen
                            prematurely.</p>
                        <p>Against the background of recent events I do feel the time is ripe for
                            engaging in open-minded and candid exploration of certain basic
                            alternatives with our close partners. We should no longer be inhibited
                            by the fear that certain approaches can be unthinkingly damned by some
                            as too “radical” a departure from the past.</p>
                        <p>I know that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> looks
                            forward to discussing these matters with the Chancellor at an early date
                            and hope that our thinking can be tested against yours at all
                            stages.</p>

                        <p>Since the British decision on June 24 to float the pound, strong
                            speculative pressures have again developed in the foreign exchange
                            markets. In two days at the end of last week,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d234fn2">July 13 and 14. Addendum A, not printed, is a
                                tabulation by day of central bank interventions to buy dollars

                                Britain floated the pound. The totals for the seven banks listed on
                                July 13 and 14 were $1,090 million and $1,450 million, respectively.
                                The seven central banks also took $217 million on July 17,
                                suggesting that this memorandum was prepared on July 18. From June
                                28 through July 17 the banks’ total purchases were $4,925

                        <p>In terms of the direct and short-term impact on the U.S. economy and
                            trade position, this turmoil is of limited significance. It is quite
                            possible that, without further action by us, the foreign central banks
                            will continue to support the dollar until the present speculative
                            pressures pass. They have a strong interest in not allowing the dollar

                        <p>We face an inherent dilemma in dealing with this situation. Our trade and
                            balance of payments position is still very weak, and the prognosis is
                            still not assured. Thus, we cannot assume present exchange rates are
                            satisfactory—and, in the case of Japan, the rate probably sooner or
                            later will need to change. Should a crisis result in further exchange
                            rate revaluations abroad, these decisions would ultimately benefit our
                            trade and balance of payments position. The dilemma is such benefits are
                            improbable without a period of turmoil and tension, with the risks cited

                                        exchange risks. In addition to the need to guard against
                                        unsustainable financial commitments, we do not want to take

                                        about extending this type of operation beyond, say $2

                                        percent of the amount borrowed but would be expected to be
                                        much less. There is a good chance of no loss or small

                                    <p>In favor of this approach, our attitude would be visibly
                                        “cooperative” and “constructive.” We should, therefore, have
                                        some greater chance of influencing European decision-making.
                                        If the operation is successful, we could obtain our
                                        immediate objectives with very little cost. If the operation
                                        is unsuccessful, in the sense that the Smithsonian rates
                                        break down anyway, the attempt to help salvage the Agreement
                                        could provide a more favorable atmosphere for the
                                        longer-term negotiations.</p>
                                    <p>Against this approach, limited intervention by the United
                                        States could easily lead to demands for “doing more.” The
                                        action proposed is technically neither convertibility nor a
                                        general guarantee of foreign dollar purchases. However,
                                        public pressures to move in those directions could well be

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Schmidt</persName>: I want to discuss
                            international monetary affairs. We are facing a very bad situation.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Minister now
                            has an opportunity to talk with one of the leading experts in this
                            field. But you probably don’t know much more yet than I. Whenever you
                            come through Washington you should come in for a talk. I value your
                            opinion on the German and US political situation. If the monetary
                            situation was indeed becoming very bad, I could help perhaps.</p>
                        <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0663"/>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Schmidt</persName>: It is bad and
                            could become worse. I thought that even ten days ago before I took on
                            this portfolio. Last year I tried to make you understand the political
                            effects in Europe of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName>’s actions. The United States cannot embark on
                            international monetary reform before its elections. Nor is this
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion of the political situation in Germany.]</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Schmidt</persName>: I have a personal
                            rule never to mind what others make of comments of mine which leak to
                            the press. I want to turn the conversation back to international
                            monetary issues, however. Billions of dollars are floating about the
                            world and Germany is taking in too many of them.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What is the cause
                            of this?</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Schmidt</persName>: The US economic
                            situation is improving. Within two years or so this may have an impact
                            on the US trade balances. Meanwhile, there are too many dollars
                            circulating in the world. New York bankers are selling dollars and the
                            German Federal Reserve System is having to buy them up at a fixed rate
                            to prevent the dollar from falling below 3.15 against the DM. The German
                            Federal Bank is handing out far too many DMark, billions in a week. This
                            has a very bad internal effect. The German price level is rising far too
                            fast. The inflation rate is 5.4 percent at present. This will be the
                            number one campaign issue. If I am to survive politically, I will have
                            to do something about this as Minister of Finance and Economics.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We want you to
                            survive, which is not to say, necessarily that we want your government
                            to do so. We appreciate how much you have done as Defense Minister.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Schmidt</persName>: My main objective
                            is to have US-German cooperation survive. The dollar problem remains and
                            the German inflation rate may reach 6 percent. To prevent this I may
                            have to cut off the purchase of the dollars “immediately.” This will be
                            done by means of regulations on capital inflows and corresponding
                            regulations on trade.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Like the
                            French.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Schmidt</persName>: There is no other
                            way. <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> was against that but
                            the whole cabinet was for it. That is why <persName corresp="#p_SK6"
                                >Schiller</persName> had to go. Last year there had been a DM float
                            and DM revaluation. There can be no revaluation this year. I want you to
                            understand the situation and the background to the action I may have to
                            take.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday, however, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName>
                            has done what I came to the United States to ask him to do. By
                            intervening in the international monetary market to sell DM he took an
                            action which serves as a token <pb n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0664"
                            />of US determination to defend the Smithsonian Agreement.<note n="2"

                                    >Hormats</persName> reported that on July 19 the U.S. Government
                                for the first time, through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
                                sold German Marks to buy dollars to help sustain the Smithsonian
                                exchange rates. <persName corresp="#p_HRD1">Hormats</persName> noted
                                that this was “a departure from the <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                    >Connally</persName> position, which had been that the Europeans
                                should continue to bear sole responsibility for maintaining the
                                Smithsonian rates.” (Ibid.) On July 29 the Embassy in Paris reported
                                that the Governor of the Bank of France thought the current calm in
                                foreign exchange markets was due both to the strong support of
                                European monetary authorities for the Smithsonian rates and U.S.
                                moves to support the dollar and reopen the U.S.-German swap line.
                                The Embassy also reported the irritable and disgruntled Governor had
                                “no sympathy” with France’s passively and unconditionally buying
                                “inconvertible” dollars, which put him on a different course from

                                    >RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1970-73, FN 10)</note> That is
                            essential: to defend the Smithsonian Agreement and not let the situation
                            get out of control.</p>
                        <p>There has as yet been no German cabinet decision to stop buying dollars.
                            I am not going to ask for one, if the United States government continues
                            actions such as the Federal Reserve Bank’s of yesterday. The
                            difficulties may be ironed out in that case. The problem is the rumor
                            mill among international bankers. The meeting of the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> finance ministers July 17-18, and the
                            rumors coming out of it has made the July 19 intervention of the Federal
                            Reserve Bank necessary</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PR8">Pauls</persName>: The Fed’s action
                            has raised the dollar by a point and a half.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Last year the
                            situation had to get very bad before I was able to intervene within the
                            government. Then the crisis was brought under control. You should know
                            that Secretary of the Treasury Schultz thinks that floating is the right
                            policy. However, I understand that a US float will make it impossible
                            for the German government to control inflationary pressures. The Germans
                            are saying to the US that either you defend the Smithsonian Agreement by
                            intervention of your own to strengthen the dollar or we will defend it
                            by means of controls.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Schmidt</persName>: That is the
                            choice. An important aspect is the psychological impact of US action on
                            bankers in New York and in Frankfurt, whose psychology I do not
                            understand very well.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I cannot give you
                            an answer right now. What is required is day-to-day actions, a series of
                            them. This is not an issue which you can bring up to the President in
                            the form of a single paper to be signed. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> and Chairman <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName> will have to take actions daily.
                            It is the totality of these, no single action, which is important. <pb
                                n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0665"/>This is different than the
                            situation last year. Then there was a concrete set of decisions to be
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>I will talk with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>
                            and Chairman <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName>. I need two

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Schmidt</persName>: I want the White
                            House to understand that even a strong supporter of cooperation with the
                            United States such as I am may have to act suddenly in the international
                            monetary field.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Our situation with
                            the Europeans is precarious. I know that. A unilateral European move in
                            the monetary field could trigger an unexpected reaction in the United
                            States. Strangely, the old internationalists in the United States have
                            now become isolationists. And the old isolationists, who have become
                            internationalists now, are good on defense but remain isolationists at
                            heart in economic affairs. I hope you will hold off any restrictive move
                            for at least ten days.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Schmidt</persName>: I am not going to
                            act within the next ten days.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know that you are
                            meeting with <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName> today. I will call <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> and explain to him that you are
                            no anti-American economic nationalist. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAF1"
                                >Burns</persName> needs no convincing. The problem with him is the
                            way he presents his views. He is a difficult personality to orchestrate
                            in a coordinated policy. However, <persName corresp="#p_BAF1"
                                >Burns</persName> favors the Smithsonian Agreement and the need to
                            defend it.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Schmidt</persName>: The Agreement
                            must be defended until the elections.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: After I have been
                            in touch with <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Burns</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> I will inform you confidentially
                            of the outcome through Rolf Pauls. That way the communication will
                            remain completely private.</p>
                        <p>What do you think about European-American relations?</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Schmidt</persName>: The greatest
                            present uncertainty is how soon the European Community will clarify its
                            views on relations with third countries, particularly the United States,
                            on European economic and monetary union, and on European political
                            consultations. None of this depends on the United States; it depends on
                                <persName corresp="#p_PG5">Pompidou</persName>’s interpretation of
                            France’s interests and on the strength of the British Pound. I don’t
                            understand the significance of the French Cabinet reshuffle.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It may be a move in
                            the Gaullist direction.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Schmidt</persName>: The central
                            problem is whether the European Community would be outward-looking, as
                            Germany wants, or inward-looking, as the French want. Germany does not
                            want the European Community to become a currency bloc against the
                            dollar. <persName corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName>’s problem was his
                            inability to deal with the French tactfully on this issue. As Economics
                            and Finance Minister I will try to establish cooperation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> as I did with Debre.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I want you to know
                            that we will miss you in the Defense Ministry. As far as you personally
                            are concerned, I am happy you can leave this suicidal post.</p>
                        <p>What do you think of US policy?</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Schmidt</persName>: You made two
                            mistakes in 1971, the first in handling of Japan and the second in
                            handling the Europeans until Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> was called home.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: To some degree the
                            Japanese are making a profession out of being hurt. What could we have
                            done to handle them better?</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Schmidt</persName>: When I was in
                            Japan I got the impression that the Japanese are somehow stirred up,
                            intrigued with the potentiality of relations with mainland China. They
                            couldn’t seem to see that mainland China can’t buy any more from Japan,
                            that it is no bigger a market than Taiwan. Somehow the Japanese have
                            lost direction and feel dropped by the United States.</p>
                        <p>This year the United States has done well—with the Moscow Summit and the
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLH1">Berlin</persName> Agreement, on which
                            the Germans and the Americans had cooperated. You helped <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> to carry out his Eastern policy
                            while strengthening the security foundation in the West.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We helped the
                            Eastern policy as much as we could without going public about it.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Schmidt</persName>: We have nothing
                            to complain about.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As far as our
                            handling of the Europeans last year is concerned, you should understand
                            that Texans like Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1"
                                >Connally</persName> are used to dealing with problems in a forceful
                            way. The Secretary is a strong, able, and attractive man.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Schmidt</persName>: Yes, he is. I
                            advised the Chancellor last year that financial and economic matters
                            should be taken out of the hands of men like <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1"
                                >Giscard</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SK6"
                                >Schiller</persName> and put into the hands of statesmen. With
                            billions of dollars floating around, the monetary crisis of 1971 can
                            easily repeat itself.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Give me two weeks
                            time to determine attitudes in the United States on international
                            monetary policy. I will let you know candidly about these attitudes.</p>

                                    >Nixon</persName>’s understanding was that the United States
                                would intervene to support the dollar at the new exchange rates. See

                        </p>
                        <p>B: The fact that you have not been involved in the last several months
                            has made it difficult for me.</p>
                        <p>K: The reason I could become involved last time was that we were moving
                            toward the Summits, and that imposed a need for a solution to the
                            monetary problem. Also, I could tell the President that unless we did
                            something we were clearly headed for a crisis. Now these conditions do
                            not exist.</p>
                        <p>B. But there was a blow up. The system was in disarray. I had to put it
                            together again last week. I went to Basel in March.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d236fn3">See <ref target="#d226">Document 226</ref>.</note>
                            The thing nearly exploded then, but I talked frankly to the central
                            bankers and we were able to hold it together.</p>
                        <p>K: What made it explode?</p>
                        <p>B: The situation was delicate. Once there was speculation against the
                            dollar, it shook the entire financial community. People did not have
                            confidence in the Smithsonian rates. I told the central bankers what the
                            Fed was doing about the interest rate, and of the President’s plans to
                            get hold of the budget. I also told them that they had made a few
                            mistakes of their own. They respect me and know that I deal frankly with
                            them. That was good for a few weeks. But we had to do something more
                            tangible. <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0668"/>I got <persName

                        <p>B: I understand him. There are numerous problems. He wants these problems
                            to go away. He resents people fooling around with these issues and just
                            hopes that they can go away.</p>

                        <p>K: Or some other means of defending the dollar.</p>
                        <p>B: We are defending the dollar. It was under attack. Foreign central
                            banks had to take in over $6 billion since December. The system just
                            won’t work if this sort of thing keeps up. On Thursday, two weeks ago,
                            they took in $1 billion-$1.5 billion.<note n="6" xml:id="d236fn6">July

                            of possibilities and decided that the best way to deal with this was to
                            have the Fed borrow currencies from foreign governments to intervene in
                            the currency market. This was done without committing our reserve
                            assets. The response around the world was one of jubilation.</p>
                        <p>K: Did you do this on your own discretion?</p>
                        <p>B: No, I needed the consent of the Treasury. I previously had had endless
                            conversations with <persName corresp="#p_VPA1">Paul Volcker</persName>,
                            who is negative about everything. I experienced some difficulty with

                        <p>K: Will this keep things in balance?</p>
                        <p>B: It should, but we can’t be sure. We committed a negligible sum—less
                            than $50 million—but got remarkable results. We are ready to commit a
                            sizable sum. But we can’t categorically say it will be successful.
                            However, the chances of success are very good. Also, there is some
                            movement on reform of the Treasury. Before I couldn’t get <persName

                            add that although the President approved my plan to do what I did, I
                            need continuous support from the President. If I lose it, <persName

                        <p>K: After December there were people trying to break the thing up. I have

                        <p>B: <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> uses brutal
                            techniques. He did well on his trip to Brazil but in Peru, shortly after
                            he left, the President made a violently anti-American speech.<note n="9"
                                xml:id="d236fn9">After he stepped down as Treasury Secretary,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CJBJ1">Connally</persName> was sent by

                            repeated three times over the air. I was told numerous times that this

                                >Connally</persName> visit. In Argentina Lanusse, after I was in his

                            my first day in Argentina and where I will spend my remaining days. He
                            was very pleased that I was talking to Argentine officials and
                            businessmen. He said to me, “Do you know what <persName

                                >Shultz</persName> got in, I was quite negative. He did not know
                            much about this. Before he was very difficult to deal with, very
                            theoretical. Now he thinks more pragmatically.</p>
                        <p>K: I was concerned he might be too doctrinaire. What is the schedule of
                            meetings?</p>
                        <p>B: There will be nothing substantive until next year.</p>
                        <p>K: This is after the German, US elections, and a Canadian election. Are
                            the Canadians having an election?</p>
                        <p>H: I recall that <persName corresp="#p_TPE2">Trudeau</persName> said
                            recently there would not be an election this winter, at least not in the

                        <p>K: They have to give two months notice so that means there probably won’t
                            be one.</p>

                        <p>K: Which direction should we move?</p>
                        <p>B: The <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> is the only thing which stands
                            for international law in the monetary area. There should be established
                            the principle of symmetry between deficit and surplus nations. Right
                            now, when a country has a deficit, it is an international sin. With a
                            surplus, it is practicing an international virtue. We should do away
                            with morality in our thinking. Apply rules that surplus countries have
                            the obligation to reduce and eliminate surpluses and deficit countries
                            have a similar obligation to reduce their deficits. We should establish
                            rules to achieve this.</p>
                        <p>K: Like what?</p>
                        <p>B: In the first year, a warning. In the second year, if it continues,
                            then withdraw convertibility. Previously convertibility has been taken
                            for granted. It was felt there was a right to convertibility. No longer
                            should it be an automatic right. The country would have to accumulate
                            foreign currencies and could not necessarily convert them.</p>
                        <p>K: This wouldn’t stop the Japanese-type of accumulation, would it?</p>
                        <p>B: No, but convertibility would be a privilege in some circumstances. We
                            must also recognize that this is a delicate problem since it means
                            sanctions against surplus countries and some loss of sovereignty. But
                            there was some loss of sovereignty in the SALT Treaty in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>K: Any treaty limits a nation’s scope of action. You give up something
                            you otherwise would have the right to do.</p>
                        <p>B: But we should be careful. While the degree of sovereignty would have
                            to be limited, we should be careful in the way we present this to
                            Congress. It is a delicate matter.</p>
                        <p>K: This is the way I see it. We can’t afford a blow up in the monetary
                            area since it affects relationships in the non-Communist world. <pb

                        <p>The resolution was adopted by the Governors of the International Monetary
                            Fund during the Fund’s Annual Meeting in Washington in September. The
                            resolution established an ad hoc Committee of the Board of Governors on
                            reform of the international monetary system. The Committee was to
                            “advise and report to the Board of Governors with respect to all aspects
                            of reform of the international monetary system, <pb n="644"
                                xml:id="pg_644" facs="0672"/>including those that involve
                            international trade, the flow of capital, investment, or development
                            assistance.” The resolution provided for a Chairman and a Deputies
                            Committee to prepare the work of the Committee. At its first meeting on
                            September 28 Mohammed Ali Wardhana, Finance Minister of Indonesia, was
                            elected Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_C201">C-20</gloss>. Jeremy

                            <item>“Dear Mr. Secretary. The Executive Board of the International
                                Monetary Fund is now completing the report it was asked to prepare
                                on reform of the international monetary system. This is the
                                culmination of a lengthy project begun last spring on the basis of a
                                text which, in accordance with normal procedures, the Fund staff
                                prepared. The initial text has been substantially modified during
                                numerous discussions of the Executive Board, in which the Directors
                                designated by the United States and France played an active
                                part.</item>

                            <item>No one considers the result of this work completely satisfactory.
                                It could not be otherwise considering the difficulty of the subject
                                and the varying conceptions of the member countries. Moreover, we
                                are still <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0673"/>beginning the
                                process of study and reconciliation of ideas to be undertaken by the
                                Group of Twenty, the organ we have created specifically for this
                                purpose.</item>

                            <item>I note, however, that the imperfections of the report,
                                particularly the fact that it poses numerous problems without
                                resolving them and does not exclude a priori and feasible reform of
                                the international monetary system, make it nearly acceptable to
                                everyone. In certain respects, this preserves the possibility of a
                                subsequent agreement on the modalities of reform.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>I am informed that, at the end of last week, the Executive
                                Director nominated by the United States proposed to introduce
                                numerous additions to each of the five chapters of the report, on
                                which the Board had virtually reached agreement. These belated
                                proposals, which very naturally reflected the views of your
                                government, jeopardized the equilibrium which until then had been
                                preserved among conflicting views. For this reason, they threatened
                                the whole project. In any case, the French Executive Director could
                                not approve a report which included both the present text and the
                                numerous paragraphs proposed by your Executive Director.</item>

                            <item>I understand, of course, that it is completely normal for the
                                United States to take a position on international monetary reform.
                                In fact, I would say it is desirable for your colleagues to be
                                better informed on this point than they have been until now. But,
                                insertions in the document being discussed at the Fund are not the
                                appropriate means to do so and, in my view, these insertions have
                                been introduced at a time when they cannot validly be
                                considered.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>In addition, I fear that difficulties at this stage would be badly
                                interpreted by the general public and thus would risk compromising
                                recent efforts undertaken on various sides to bring more order to
                                exchange markets. Neither would they represent an encouraging
                                introduction to the work of the Group of Twenty.</item>

                            <item>I strongly hope that you will give the present message all the
                                importance it merits and that you will reconsider the means at your
                                disposal to make your positions on international monetary problems
                                known. Let me add that I am looking forward to meeting you in
                                Washington at the end of September under circumstances which will
                                allow us to lay out and discuss these problems at a suitable level
                                within reasonable bounds. Sincerely yours, Valery Giscard

                                the occasion of my first call on him on July 31 to press home his
                                views on the international monetary situation. He began by saying
                                that, although he had had good and full conversations with Secretary

                                Washington, there had since been a further evolution in his thinking
                                which he wanted to bring to our attention. Since we had known each

                                <p>He could not understand the passivity of the US in the
                                    international monetary field during recent months. This had made
                                    it extremely difficult for our European friends to believe that
                                    the US really wanted to adhere to the Smithsonian Agreement. The
                                    recent intervention of the Federal Reserve on behalf of the
                                    dollar had been a good thing psychologically, even if it had but
                                    only a symbolic effect quantitatively considered, but even that
                                    would be lost quickly if it were not repeated from time to time.
                                    One point on which he wanted to be absolutely frank was that, if
                                    a heavy flow of dollars into Germany should resume for whatever
                                    reason, he would not hesitate to impose controls even though
                                    these would inevitably also have some trade impact. The former
                                    Minister of Economics and Finance had fallen on precisely this
                                    issue. He had been opposed by the majority of the Cabinet and
                                    the German banking community.</p>
                                <p>As far as <persName corresp="#p_SH1">Schmidt</persName> was
                                    concerned, he approached this whole question from the viewpoint
                                    of a politician who had not asked for his present post but had
                                    accepted it out of a sense of obligation to his party. The
                                    political stakes were simply too high to leave the subject to
                                    the technicians or even to a conventional Minister of Finance.
                                    This was the position he had taken with <persName
                                        corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> before the <persName
                                        corresp="#p_SK6">Schiller</persName> showdown and was one he
                                    would maintain in his present office. There were two major
                                    reasons why he could not accept the possibility of a further
                                    German float and would have to resort to exchange controls if
                                    necessary: (A) the “already not so good prospects” for <persName
                                        corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> in the forthcoming
                                    elections would be completely ruined if the European Summit were
                                    not to take place, and it could not take place unless the German
                                    position on dollar inflow were to come closer to the French, and
                                    (B) the long-range requirements of the German economy and its
                                    export potential likewise were not compatible with a further
                                    float.</p>

                            <item>He was aware of course, Schmidt continued, that no fundamental
                                action could be expected in the monetary field before the American
                                    <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0678"/>and German elections,
                                but he was concerned about the possibility that pre-electoral
                                rumors, perhaps in October, would set off another wave of
                                speculation against the dollar. This would trigger the kind of
                                German reaction which he had indicated he would be forced to take.
                                If it were possible to get through the fall period without such a
                                development, then 1973 would be a year in which there would be real
                                need for an inconspicuous but real American leadership in the
                                international monetary field. Without it, any hope of basic reform
                                would be illusory. He was not certain, after his visit to
                                Washington, which line of thinking would prevail, but it was clear
                                that it was in our common interest to change a situation which, from
                                the European point of view, had become untenable.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>I observed that since he had had an opportunity, during his recent
                                trip to the US to receive at first hand the views of the senior
                                American officials whom he had met, there was little I could add at
                                this time to what they had told him. We are not indifferent. We too
                                consider international monetary reform and trade negotiations a
                                matter of urgency and want to get on with them as expeditiously as
                                possible. I would report his views and hoped that he would feel free
                                in the future to convey any information or thoughts which he might
                                have through me to my government. He said he would not hesitate
                                whenever he felt it necessary to get in touch with me immediately.
                                Comment: It is clear that <persName corresp="#p_SH1"
                                    >Schmidt</persName> is not particularly happy in his new role as
                                Minister of Economics and Finance. I believe he is sincere in saying
                                that he took this position mainly out of loyalty to his party and to
                                the Chancellor. He would be the first to acknowledge that his
                                understanding of the complexities of international finance is still
                                elementary, but he is a quick learner as well as one of the most
                                articulate politicians on the current German scene. His influence
                                with the Chancellor will be very great in the months to come, and
                                the views he expressed will carry much weight in cabinet
                                deliberations. In talking about his health, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SH1">Schmidt</persName> could only say that while he
                                felt better than he had in many months, he had come to appreciate
                                that he is no longer a young man. He intended to go off on a month’s
                                leave immediately after his appointment with me, but added, somewhat
                                apologetically, that he would be in constant touch with his Ministry
                                and prepared to return to Bonn at any time if necessary.</item>

                                did not believe “exchange rates in the past had been sticky and that
                                the U.S. should not expect to correct its balance of payments
                                problems only by current account improvements.” The French statement
                                also made it clear France wanted to increase the role and price of
                                gold in the international monetary system. (Telegram 146942 to

                        <p>In this effort, I fully share your wish that the report, however
                            imperfect, pose relevant problems, explore feasible alternatives and,
                            especially, ‘preserve the possibility of subsequent agreement on the
                            modalities of reform.’ This is our entire purpose in the drafting
                            proposals we have made. The apparent question in your mind as to our
                            purpose can perhaps be answered most clearly by reviewing the background
                            of this matter, and the manner in which our own concern with this
                            objective has been expressed.</p>
                        <p>To that end, I asked that a short memorandum be prepared reviewing our
                            approach. I attach it for your interest.</p>
                        <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0680"/>
                        <p>I should note that the substantive views put forward in writing by the
                            U.S. Director are entirely consistent with those which have been
                            articulated for many months by high U.S. officials in public and private
                            statements.</p>
                        <p>In the light of our experience, I believe you will agree that, since the
                            staff draft failed to take adequate account of our views, we had no
                            alternative to proposing such additions as we felt essential. Indeed, we
                            have found others welcomed this direct expression of views on matters of
                            such direct concern to us.</p>
                        <p>If the draft Fund report had, in fact, left open an adequate range of
                            realistic options for an appropriate reform of the international
                            economic and monetary systems, we would have been satisfied. That is all
                            we seek. But we are convinced the drafts at hand did not accomplish that
                            purpose. We are frankly very disappointed at this.<note n="4"

                            negotiation suggests the wisdom of openly addressing the basic issues
                            involved, and patiently seeking a sound solution, rather than accepting
                            at the start a formula for discussion that obscures important dimensions
                            of the problem. Sincerely yours, <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">George P.

                            Consideration of Report on International Monetary Reform.</p>
                        <p>From the very first suggestions that a report on this subject be
                            completed by the Executive Board prior to this year’s Governors’ meeting
                            and before the agreed negotiating forum was established, I have
                            expressed serious doubts that the Executive Board should try to reach
                            definite conclusions in a report at this early stage. These views were
                            repeated in the Executive Board in May, when I suggested “only a report
                            providing a genuinely neutral description of various policy options
                            would have any chance of being adopted.”</p>
                        <p>We were therefore disappointed, when the original staff draft of the
                            report was issued in early June, that instead of developing underlying
                            issues and basic options the draft adopted a narrow focus pointing
                            almost exclusively toward a particular form of an asset settlements
                            system <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0681"/>and a confined range of
                            technical possibilities relevant thereto. With this in mind, on June 19,
                            I distributed a written statement (copy attached) expressing our views
                            on the report, emphasizing our belief that the most useful contribution
                            of a report would be to identify and reach a consensus on the essential
                            nature of the problems, without foreclosing policy options. I urged a
                            “less technical” but “more fundamental” approach concentrating on
                            achieving an agreed description of the kind of world to which the
                            reforms must be addressed and developing the key policy issues which the
                            Governors would wish to address.</p>
                        <p>In addition to my written and oral comments in the Fund Board, our
                            concern over the direction of the draft report was also strongly
                            stressed in direct discussions with the Managing Director and top Staff
                            of the Fund, and with a number of Executive Directors, by the Under
                            Secretary for Monetary Affairs.</p>
                        <p>We were aware that the approach adopted in the draft, if pressed, would
                            inevitably place the primary burden on the U.S. to inject other and
                            broader viewpoints by a process of addition and amendment. While we were
                            willing to accept that responsibility, we also recognized some
                            misunderstanding or question of our motives could arise. We, therefore,
                            greatly preferred to work with staff drafts that more fully developed
                            the problems and basic options.</p>
                        <p>These strongly stated views were not adequately reflected in the revised
                            draft distributed in the first part of July. Accordingly, to achieve the
                            analysis and balance we felt necessary, we had no alternative to
                            submitting written material reflecting U.S. views, attempting to focus
                            more attention on what we consider to be the real issues and appropriate
                            policy options. In this process, I have, in important areas, taken care
                            to emphasize the United States, itself, had reached no conclusion and
                            final judgment. <persName corresp="#p_DWB1">William B. Dale</persName>.

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DWB1">Dale</persName>’s Overall Comments on
                            Report to Governors—June 19, 1972</p>
                        <p>With the opening of discussion based on four draft chapters for a report
                            to assist in the reform discussions, it is important to consider what
                            kind of product we can realistically hope to agree on that would also be
                            helpful—not only to the Governors in general, but in particular to the
                            prospective Governors’ Committee as it begins its work. At this early
                            stage of work on reform, the critical task is to insure a fully
                            adequate—a wide enough—variety of approaches to the problem so as not to
                            preclude options at too early a stage.</p>
                        <p>We are not satisfied that the draft as it stands does that adequately.
                            While it leaves some options open, it basically narrows down the
                            discussion quite rapidly—prematurely in our view—to only one set of <pb
                                n="654" xml:id="pg_654" facs="0682"/>basic options, a somewhat
                            improved par value system coupled with a reserve asset settlement
                            mechanism with the <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> at its center. We
                            do not deny that such a system has certain attractions, but so may other
                            combinations that have not been considered in the draft, and in any
                            event it is by no means evident to us—from reading the draft and from
                            other thoughts and sources—that such a system could in fact be made to
                            work realistically even assuming it were generally considered desirable
                            after examination of the alternatives.</p>
                        <p>There seem to me to be four main possibilities for a report: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>One which puts forward a full and really open-minded
                                    discussion of a range of technical and policy options adequately
                                    broad for the depth and scope of the reform negotiation which
                                    lies ahead;</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>One which would be a mish-mash of undigested and inconsistent
                                    ideas, which might be the result if everyone simply tossed his
                                    favorite idea into the hopper;</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>A less technical and perhaps shorter report, but quite
                                    possibly a more fundamental one, concentrating on: <list>
                                        <label>a.</label>
                                        <item>a description of the world which the trading and
                                            monetary systems must be addressed to; and</item>
                                        <label>b.</label>
                                        <item>discussing in reasonably brief and non-technical
                                            manner the key policy issues to which the Governors’
                                            Committee will wish to direct its attention.</item>
                                        <label>4.</label>
                                        <item>No report, because in the end we found ourselves
                                            unable to reach sufficient agreement.</item>
                                    </list>
                                </item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The first outcome, while ideal, may as a practical matter be out of
                            reach. The second or fourth outcomes constitute very real possibilities,
                            neither of which would be particularly useful from any point of
                            view.</p>
                        <p>The third option may well be the most realistically useful, and could
                            provide very helpful material indeed for the work that lies ahead. <hi

                            attention to their problems in the two speeches.</p>
                        <p>There was a widespread feeling of relief that the United States had
                            decided to resume a position of leadership in monetary affairs. Most
                            commentators felt that the United States’ proposals provided a basis
                            upon which serious negotiations could begin, even if they disagreed with
                            specific portions of the proposals. Several reports credited the
                            American initiatives with giving the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                            meeting a sense of direction which had previously been missing. A
                            recurring theme was that the President’s and Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>’ speeches reflected increased
                            American confidence based on improvements in American economic
                            performance and our diplomatic initiatives with the USSR and the PRC.
                            Some reports noted that the speeches had firmly defended American
                            interests, while abandoning the extremes of the “Texas approach”.</p>
                        <p>European commentators generally felt that the <persName corresp="#p_SGP1"
                                >Shultz</persName> proposals were basically constructive and
                            welcomed the evidence that the U.S. is willing to move forward in
                            monetary reform. The initial French reaction was negative or neutral,
                            but after the speech of Minister of Finance <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1"
                                >Giscard d’Estaing</persName>, French commentary became more
                            optimistic. The French felt that the generally conciliatory <persName
                                corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName> speech had sidetracked the
                            gold price issue, while <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>
                            had opened the door toward dollar convertibility. There was speculation
                            in the press that the atmosphere of cooperation is the result of a
                            recent <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>-<persName

                        <p>The Canadian press generally felt that the American proposals provided a
                            framework for negotiating monetary reform, while reacting with concern
                            to <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>’s call for “more
                            stringent” standards for countries that float their currencies (as
                            Canada is now doing).</p>
                        <p>The Japanese appear to view the <persName corresp="#p_SGP1"
                                >Shultz</persName> proposals as threatening. Several press comments
                            referred to the anti-Japanese tone of the speech and worried that it was
                            an effort to set the stage for unilateral imposition of import
                            surcharges on Japanese products or for increased pressure for yen
                            revaluation. There was some worry that the Europeans may now support
                            these efforts (a Newsweek story quoting a top U.S. official at the
                            meetings “as saying the U.S., Britain, and West Germany planned to force
                            a revaluation of the Japanese yen” will fuel these fears). The Japanese
                            press felt that the <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>
                            proposals represented an effort to make the surplus nations <pb n="658"
                                xml:id="pg_658" facs="0686"/>bear the adjustment burden, although
                            many Japanese commentators called for increased Japanese government
                            action to reduce that nation’s trade surplus. The Australian press
                            echoed the Japanese press in worrying about being the target of rules
                            against surplus countries, while calling the <persName corresp="#p_SGP1"
                                >Shultz</persName> speech “demanding but reasonable”.</p>
                        <p>The developing countries, while generally welcoming the U.S. decision to
                            move forward on monetary reform, were disappointed by the lack of
                            attention to development problems in either speech. This omission,
                            coupled with Chilean attacks on the U.S. for blocking <gloss
                                target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> lending to Chile and the general lack
                            of progress on the question of a link between Special Drawing Rights and
                            development, seemed to some <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>’s to
                            confirm their fears that the U.S. is not greatly interested in the
                            problems of the developing countries.</p>

                        <p>On October 3, 1972, <persName corresp="#p_HRD1">Hormats</persName> sent a

                            him that, in contrast to the roiled foreign exchange environment during
                            the summer, the dollar had recently strengthened in European foreign
                            exchange markets. During the previous week it had strengthened against
                            all major European currencies and none of the European central banks had
                            been required to purchase dollars to support their exchange rates.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRD1">Hormats</persName> attributed this to an

                        <p>As 1972 ended, the newly established <gloss target="#t_C201">C-20</gloss>
                            and its Deputies Committee began its work on international monetary
                            reform, but the pace was slow. The first Ministerial on September 28
                            (see <ref target="#d237">Document 237</ref>) was the only Ministerial
                            during 1972. A second Deputies meeting was held November 27-29. The
                            Embassy in London reported that during an <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss> Monetary Committee meeting on November 21 there was a
                            constructive exchange of views on monetary reform. The Embassy noted
                            there was scope for fruitful analysis of reserve gains and losses at the
                            forthcoming Deputies meeting, but U.S. insistence on rigid, automatic
                            criteria (for exchange rate adjustments) would not be acceptable.
