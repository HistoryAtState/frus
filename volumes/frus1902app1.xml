                        <p>The undersigned, counsel for the Government of the United States of
                            America, has the honor to present to the honorable arbitrator the
                            following memorandum of the Government of the United States of America
                            in support of the claims of the owners, officers, and crews of the
                            American bark <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> and of the
                            American schooners <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis, C. H.
                                White</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> for indemnity
                            on account of the arrest and seizure of the said vessels by the agents
                            and officers of the Imperial Government of Russia.</p>
                        <p>By an exchange of identical notes, dated September 8, 1900, between the
                            representatives of the two high contracting powers, duly authorized to
                            that effect, the Government of the United States of America and the
                            Imperial Government of Russia have agreed to refer to arbitration their
                            differences relative to the claims for indemnity of certain citizens of
                            the United States of America.</p>
                        <p>This indemnity is claimed on account of the losses and injuries sustained
                            by citizens of the United States by the arrest and seizure of American
                            vessels as well as by reason of other actions committed in relation
                            thereto by the agents and officers of the Government of Russia.</p>
                        <p>The statement of the facts of these arrests and seizures, with the
                            supporting evidence, the statements of the damages suffered by the
                            claimants, and the arguments in support of the claims are duly set forth
                            in the documents hereto annexed, marked respectively: Case 1, “the <hi
                                rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon;</hi>” case 2, “the <hi rend="italic"
                                >James Hamilton Lewis;</hi>” case 3, “the <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                                White;</hi>” case 4, “the <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna.</hi>“</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States of America maintains that the said
                            arrests and seizures, as well as all the other acts relating thereto
                            which resulted in injury to citizens of the United States, were contrary
                            to international law and to the treaty rights of the United States, as
                            well as an invasion of the personal rights of its citizens.</p>
                        <p>Among the damages sustained by citizens of the United States in this
                            connection, the officers and crews of the vessels <hi rend="italic">Cape
                                Horn Pigeon, James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                                White</hi> were unwarrantably held as prisoners.</p>
                        <p>The Commission appointed to adjust the difference between the United
                            States and Great Britain under the treaty of Washington of 1871 made the

                                    until March 4, 1864, when he was discharged without trial. He
                                    was arrested upon the ground that he was purchasing arms for the
                                    Confederates, but the charge was not sustained. He was awarded
                                    $15,700.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The question of interest on the amount of indemnity arises in all four of
                            the cases. To award to the claimants the amount of the indemnity alone
                            would not be to make to them <hi rend="italic">restitutio in
                                integrum</hi>. If it is found that indemnity is due to the owners of
                            a vessel for her confiscation, made nine years previously, and it is
                            decided to award to them to-day only the value of the vessel, this would
                            not be to make restitution to them for their entire losses, for they
                            have lost not only the value of the vessel but also the ability to earn,
                            either by means of the services of their vessel or with the equivalent
                            capital.</p>
                        <p>In cases of this nature the principle of allowing a just rate of interest
                            on the indemnity is so universally recognized as to preclude the
                            necessity of argument upon the subject.</p>
                        <p>In his award in favor of the <hi rend="italic">John S. Bryan</hi> for the
                            payment of interest on the amount of the indemnity due by the Brazilian
                            Government the arbitrator said:</p>
                        <p>“The principle on which this sum is awarded has long been settled.”</p>
                        <p>Among the numerous cases in which tribunals of arbitration have allowed
                            interest in their awards the following may be cited:</p>
                        <p>The commission appointed according to the treaty of 1794 between the
                            United States and Great Britain allowed interest on all the claims.</p>
                        <p>In the Chinese indemnity arbitration the commission allowed interest at
                            the rate of 12 per cent.</p>
                        <p>The decisions of the American and English claims commission, under the
                            treaty of Washington of 1871, included interest in all the awards, with
                            some few exceptions.</p>
                        <p>The Geneva tribunal of arbitration in the “Alabama claims” included
                            interest in every case in its award, as also in the arbitration of the
                            claims of the United States against Mexico and against Brazil.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the <hi rend="italic">Costa Rica Packet</hi> the
                            distinguished arbitrator awarded to the claimants interest at the rate
                            of 8 per cent.</p>
                        <p>In the recent arbitration (1897) between the United States of America and
                            Great Britain upon the claims arising out of seizures in the Bering Sea
                            interest was universally allowed.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States of America therefore submits to the
                            honorable arbitrator the following statements of claims, in the full
                            confidence that they are well founded and perfectly just.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> was an American bark, duly registered
                    in accordance with the laws of the United States at the port of New Bedford, in
                    the State of Massachusetts, and owned and officered by American citizens. She
                    was equipped for a whaling voyage in the North Pacific Ocean, upon which she set
                    sail on December 7, 1891, and on the 10th day of September, 1892, while
                    peaceably engaged in the pursuit of her legitimate calling on the high seas in
                    the Okhotsk Sea, many miles from any land and wholly without Russian
                    jurisdiction, she was seized by the Imperial Russian authorities and forcibly
                    distrained and taken to Vladivostok, to the great injury of her owners,
                    officers, and crew.</p>
                <p>The agents and managing owners of the vessel were, at the time of the seizure,
                    Joseph Wing and William R. Wing, both of New Bedford, in the said State of
                    Massachusetts, copartners, doing business under the firm name of J. &amp; W. R.
                    Wing.</p>
                <p>On the 10th day of September, A. D. 1892, the said <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                        Pigeon</hi>, her outfits and cargo, were owned as follows: J. &amp; W. R.
                    Wing, of New Bedford, Mass., held four sixty-fourths; Thomas M. Hart, of New
                    Bedford, Mass., held two sixty-fourths; John Wing, of New Bedford, Mass., held
                    two sixty-fourths; Edward F. Potter, of Dartmouth, Mass., held eleven
                    sixty-fourths; Edward F. Potter, executor of the will of William Potter, second,
                    of Dartmouth, Mass., deceased, held eight sixty-fourths; Michael Baker,
                    administrator de bonis non with the will annexed of Michael Baker, 3d, of
                    Dartmouth, Mass., deceased, held four sixty-fourths; George W. Collins, of
                    Dartmouth, Mass., held one sixty-fourth; Charles C. Church, of Gosnold, Mass.,
                    held two sixty-fourths. The said ownership duly appears in the certificate of
                    the collector of customs of the port of New Bedford, a copy of which is hereto
                    annexed, marked “Exhibit A.” By the said certificate it appears that the estate
                    of Alexander H. Seabury was the owner of ten sixty-fourths. Said interest had
                    been conveyed previous to the 10th day of September, A. D. 1892, to Louisa B.
                    Haskell, daughter of the said Alexander H. Seabury, deceased. A certified copy
                    of the last register of the said bark, dated the 30th day of November, 1887, is
                    also hereto annexed, marked “Exhibit B.” Subsequent to that date the interest
                    therein specified of Jonathan Bourne, two sixty-fourths, had been conveyed to
                    Joseph and William R. Wing; the three sixty-fourths of Abner Potter, jr., of
                    Portsmouth, R. I., therein stated, had been acquired by Edward F. Potter; the
                    four sixty-fourths of Robert Allen therein stated had also <pb n="12"
                        xml:id="pg_12" facs="0022"/>been acquired by Joseph and William R. Wing, who
                    had conveyed to Thomas Scullun four sixty-fourths, making the interest of the
                    said Joseph and William R. Wing twenty sixty-fourths, as stated in the
                    collector’s certificate. All and each of the said owners are native American
                    citizens, and they each claim in their own right were each citizens of the
                    United States when the claim had its origin, and their domicile was then as
                    herein stated.</p>
                <p>The officers and crew of the said bark on the 10th day of September, A. D. 1892,
                    were, as stated in the crew list hereto annexed, marked “Exhibit C,” stating
                    their names, places of birth, places of residence, of what country citizens or
                    subjects, age, height, complexion, and color of hair. They numbered 30 besides
                    the captain. The officers and crew upon this voyage were shipped in accordance
                    with the provisions of the shipping paper, a copy of which is hereto annexed,
                    marked “Exhibit D,” in which the lay or share of each officer and member of the
                    crew is stated, except that of the captain, which was by agreement—and a copy of
                    the said agreement is hereto annexed—marked “Exhibit E.” The compensation of the
                    said officers and crew is, by the articles of said shipping paper, fixed as a
                    share of the net proceeds of the voyage, and said proceeds include whatever is
                    recovered by the owners in place of catch from whatever source. The said claims
                    of the said officers and crew are owned by the said officers and crew
                    respectively, except in the cases of some of the crew which have been assigned
                    to the owners in consideration of the advance by the owners of different sums to
                    such of the crew as made request for this to be done. Owing to the small
                    quantity of oil brought in by the bark, as hereinafter stated, most of the
                    seamen are in debt to the ship, their advance and ship’s bill amounting to more
                    than their pay, and thereupon payments were made by the owners to such of the
                    crew as requested it, and their claims were assigned to the owners.</p>
                <p>The said bark was built in Dartmouth, Mass., in the year 1854, for the whaling
                    business and has always been engaged in the whaling business.</p>
                <p>Said bark was purchased by the said Joseph and William R. Wing at the date of the
                    register in the fall of 1887, having been owned and managed previously to that
                    time by William Potter from the time she was built. The said Joseph and William
                    R. Wing were owners in her at the time she was built and have continued so ever
                    since. She was of 201 42/100 tons burden, present measurement. She was fitted
                    out at San Francisco, Cal., by the said J. and W. R. Wing, in December, 1891,
                    for a year’s whaling voyage in the Japan and Okhotsk seas. She was fully
                    equipped for said whaling voyage, and neither directly or indirectly was fitted
                    for a sealing voyage, or for aiding or assisting others engaged in sealing, and
                    in the equipment and fitting out aforesaid whaling Toy age no intention was had
                    of taking any fur seal on land or water on the Okhotsk Sea or elsewhere; no
                    tackle therefor was put on board, and no material for the preservation of seal
                    skins. A certified copy of the clearance of said bark on said voyage is hereto
                    annexed, marked “Exhibit F,” and a certified copy of the manifest, marked
                    “Exhibit G,” the originals of said papers being duly filed in the custom
                    house.</p>
                <p>As hereinbefore stated, the said bark sailed upon the said whaling voyage on
                    December 7, 1891. The history of the said voyage of the said (<hi rend="italic"
                        >Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> is narrated in detail in the affidavit of the captain
                        <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0023"/>of the bark, Thomas Scullun, a duly
                    authenticated copy of which affidavit is hereto annexed, marked “Exhibit H.”</p>
                <p>From said affidavit it appears that on the 10th day of September, A. D. 1892, the
                        <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> was in the Okhotsk Sea, upon the
                    high seas, where she had a perfect right to be, engaged in her legitimate
                    calling of whaling; that she had twice previously during the said voyage called
                    at the Russian port of Vladivostok, where her captain had not only publicly
                    announced his intention of whaling in the Okhotsk Sea, but had communicated with
                    the Imperial Russian Government, asking permission to enter and fish for whales
                    in certain bays which he deemed to be within Russian jurisdiction. The reason
                    for preferring this request for permission to visit the said bays was the
                    previous issuance by the Imperial Russian Government of a notice to mariners
                    forbidding them to fish for whales within the limit of 3 miles from the Russian
                    coast or in the bays included within such 3-mile limit, a copy of which
                    notification having been published in the New Bedford Whalemen’s List, a journal
                    devoted to the whaling interest, published in America, on December 7, 1875, a
                    copy of which is annexed to the deposition of W. R. Wing, hereto annexed and
                    hereinafter referred to, said deposition being marked “Exhibit V,” and said copy
                    of said notification being marked “Annex 9” thereof. And said assertion as to
                    the issuance of such notification to mariners, forbidding them to fish for
                    whales within said bays, is further supported by the official document of the
                    Imperial Russian ministry of marine, dated 1875, a copy of which is hereto
                    annexed, together with a sworn translation of a paragraph on page 91 of said
                    document, all included in Exhibit C C. This permission to visit the said bays
                    was not granted, but neither was any intimation given to the captain that the
                    Imperial Russian Government claimed jurisdiction over the entire waters of the
                    Okhotsk Sea or the right to prohibit its navigation for any purpose whatsoever
                    beyond the ordinary jurisdiction commonly accepted among nations as appertaining
                    to all countries, namely, a marine league from low-water mark. Yet it appears
                    further from the same affidavit, what is admitted to be the case by the Imperial
                    Russian Government in a note from the Imperial Russian ministry of foreign
                    affairs to the then envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the
                    United States of America, dated June 12 (old style), or June 24 (new style),
                    1893, a certified copy of which is hereto annexed, marked “Exhibit I,” namely,
                    that the said bark was arrested and seized upon the open sea of Okhotsk Sea upon
                    the said 10th day of September (new style), or 29th day of August (old style),
                    1892, by an officer of the Imperial Russian navy, in command of an armed vessel
                    of said navy, by force of arms, and by force of arms taken to Vladivostok. It
                    also appears from the said affidavit that the captain duly protested against the
                    arrest and seizure of his vessel, but that in spite of his protests the seizure
                    was made and the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> was
                    pressed, against their will, into the service of the Imperial Russian
                    Government, and compelled to navigate the vessel of the said officer of the
                    Imperial Russian navy into Vladivostok. And it further appears from said
                    affidavit and from the log book of the said vessel, which is hereto annexed,
                    forming part of the deposition of W. R. Wing, Exhibit V, and marked “Annex 1” of
                    that exhibit, that the said bark was detained by the Imperial Russian
                    authorities until the 1st day of October, 1892. It also appears from the said
                    affidavit that the arresting officer of the Imperial Russian navy set up the
                    claim, in making the arrest, that <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0024"/>the
                    Okhotsk Sea was a closed sea. In the note of the Imperial Russian ministry of
                    foreign affairs, dated June 12/24, 1893, above cited and marked “Exhibit I,” no
                    attempt is made to support this claim, nor does it appear that the Russian
                    Government has ever claimed exclusive jurisdiction over that sea.</p>
                <p>Upon the arrival of the said bark in the harbor of Vladivostok the captain took
                    the first available opportunity to inform, by telegraph, the legation of the
                    United States of America at St. Petersburg of the seizure of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> in a telegram, a certified copy of which
                    is hereto annexed, marked “Exhibit J.”</p>
                <p>Upon receipt of the said telegram the then Chargé d’Affaires of the said United
                    States addressed a note to the Imperial Russian ministry of foreign affairs,
                    dated September 9/21, 1892, a certified copy of which is hereto annexed, marked
                    “Exhibit K,” and received in reply a note from the said Imperial ministry, dated
                    September 19 (old style), October 1 (new style), 1892, a certified copy of which
                    note is hereto annexed, marked “Exhibit L,” informing the said Chargé d’Affaires
                    that the said bark had been released.</p>
                <p>And in point of fact the said bark <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> was
                    released, but not until it was too late to continue her whaling voyage for that
                    season, for, as is shown by the affidavits of three experienced whaling captains
                    familiar with the habits of the whales and with the winds in the said Okhotsk
                    Sea, certified copies of which affidavits are hereto annexed, marked
                    respectively “Exhibit M,” “Exhibit N,” and “Exhibit O,” the whaling season
                    closes in the Okhotsk Sea between the 1st and 10th days of October, while the
                        <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> was unable to leave Vladivostok
                    before October 1, 1892.</p>
                <p>By reason of this seizure by the Imperial Russian Government of the said bark <hi
                        rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, and of the subsequent action of the
                    said Government in forcibly taking the said bark away from her fishing grounds
                    just at the most favorable season of the year, when the whales had just begun to
                    strike in to the said fishing grounds, and in detaining her at Vladivostok, a
                    point far removed from said fishing grounds, until it was impossible for her to
                    get back and resume her lawful calling, not only before the season would have
                    terminated, but in time for her to have proceeded to any other whaling waters to
                    resume her calling and arrive at San Francisco within the limit of time
                    specified in the contract with the crew, namely, in the autumn of 1892, thereby
                    depriving the owners, officers, and crew of said bark of the services of the
                    vessel and her outfit for the remainder of the season, as well as in the
                    consumption of the provisions and stores of said bark by the officers and men of
                    the Russian Government, the pressing of the crew into the service of the said
                    Government, compelling them to bring the Russian vessel to Vladivostok against
                    their will, and by reason of the expenses incurred, not only by the captain,
                    officers, and crew at Vladivostok for their maintenance, but by reason of the
                    necessity of sending many and costly telegraphic messages to distant parts of
                    the world, the consultation of legal counsel, the necessary hire of clerical
                    assistance, of boats, and of carriages, the detention of the crew as prisoners,
                    and the failure to provide for said crew’s needs, and, finally, by reason of the
                    expense of the present proceedings, the owners, officers, and crew of the said
                    bark <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> suffered severe damage, for which
                    damage they now seek indemnity.</p>
                <p>These damages the said captain of the said bark <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                        Pigeon</hi> estimated, at the time of the arrest and detention at
                    Vladivostok, at <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0025"/>$49,500, and he presented
                    to the competent officer of the Imperial Russian Government at Vladivostok a
                    claim for that amount of damage in two letters dated at Vladivostok the 15–27th
                    day of September, 1892, copies of which letters are hereto annexed, marked,

                <p>On the 3d day of May (old style), 1893, the then envoy extraordinary and minister
                    plenipotentiary of the United States near to His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of
                    all the Russias, addressed a note to the Imperial Russian ministry of foreign
                    affairs, a duly certified copy of which is hereto annexed, marked “Exhibit Q,”
                    again calling the attention of the Imperial Government to the seizure of the
                    said bark <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> and requesting that an
                    investigation be made as to the action of the Imperial Russian officials in this
                    regard, and that the legation of the United States be informed as to the results
                    of said investigation. In reply to the said note the said ministry of foreign
                    affairs addressed to the said legation the note, already cited and marked
                    “Exhibit I,” under date of June 24 (new style), 1893. In this note it is stated
                    that a commission had been appointed to inquire into the seizure of the said
                    bark <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, and that this commission, while
                    practically in accord with the statement made by the captain of the said bark as
                    to the locality of the bark when seized, found that, while the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> had navigated within Russian territorial waters,
                    there was no reason for ordering her confiscation, and admitted that the arrest
                    had been made owing to a misunderstanding, and had ordered the release of the
                    vessel. The said note, after expressing the opinion that the item of damages for
                    whales which could have been taken had not the voyage been interrupted,
                    amounting to $45,000, was excessive, expresses the opinion that $2,500 would be
                    sufficient to indemnify the parties in interest for their losses, thereby
                    admitting that an indemnity for the seizure was due.</p>
                <p>On the 2d day of June (old style), 14th day of June (new style), 1894, the then
                    envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States of America
                    near to His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, acting under
                    instructions from his Government, addressed a note to the Imperial Russian
                    ministry of foreign affairs, a copy of which is hereto annexed marked “Exhibit
                    R,” presenting the claims of the owners, officers, and crew of the said bark <hi
                        rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> for indemnity for the arrest of the said
                    bark. No answer being received to the said note, the legation of the United
                    States at St. Petersburg, Russia, continued to press for a reply thereto, but it
                    was not until October 12/24, 1895, that the reply of the said ministry of
                    foreign affairs, a copy of which is hereto annexed marked “Exhibit S,” was
                    received. In this reply the said ministry already referring to its former
                    expression in the note of the said ministry already referred to and marked
                    “Exhibit I,” requests that the imperial Government be furnished vouchers for the
                    expenses incurred by the captain and owners of the said bark <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, which expenditures, amounting to $3,400, had been
                    included in the claims as presented by the said minister plenipotentiary of the
                    United States in the note before cited and marked “Exhibit S.”</p>
                <p>As while the Imperial Russian Government recognized the fact that the seizure of
                    the said bark <hi rend="italic">Gape Horn Pigeon</hi> was unjustifiable, and <pb
                        n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0026"/>that a certain indemnity therefor was due
                    to the owners, officers, and crew thereof, as is shown in the notes of the
                    Imperial ministry of foreign affairs above referred to, but repudiated the
                    principal item of the claim, namely, that for the loss of the services of the
                    said bark, her equipment, and crew during the period of the detention, it did
                    not seem to the claimants expedient to in any way appear to acquiesce in the
                    justice of such repudiation by submitting at that time an account in detail for
                    any minor part of their claim independent of the principal and disputed item
                    thereof. All these items of expense are, however, now submitted in detail in the
                    bill for damages hereto annexed.</p>
                <p>On the 27th day of January (8th day of February), 1899, the then Chargé
                    d’Affaires, acting under instructions from his Government, addressed a note to
                    the Imperial Russian ministry of foreign affairs, a copy of which is hereto
                    annexed marked “Exhibit T,” offering to accept, on behalf of these claimants,
                    for the damages suffered by them on account of the seizure of the said bark <hi
                        rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, and in full settlement therefor, the
                    sum of $42,000, by way of compromise, but this offer was made by the Government
                    of the United States with the express statement, distinctly set forth in the
                    said note, that the said offer was made with a view to reaching an early
                    settlement of the case, and that, should the said offer of compromise be refused
                    by the Imperial Russian Government, nothing therein should be construed as in
                    any way to prejudice the rights of the said claimants, nor especially their
                    right to recover the full amount of their claims by arbitration or by
                    negotiation.</p>
                <p>In reply the embassy of the United States of America received a note from the
                    Imperial Russian ministry of foreign affairs, dated March 13 (old style), March
                    25 (new style), 1899, a copy of which is hereto annexed marked “Exhibit U,” in
                    which the Imperial Russian Government rejected the offer of compromise submitted
                    by the Government of the United States and again offered the sum of $2,500
                    indemnity for the aforesaid seizure of the bark <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn

                <p>The Okhotsk Sea is a great arm of the North Pacific Ocean, from which it is
                    separated by the chain of islands known as the Kuril Islands. Its vast extent
                    precludes the possibility of its effective occupation and control by any single
                    nation. Nor, indeed, has any such occupation ever been attempted, nor has the
                    Imperial Russian Government ever publicly asserted any right to control the
                    navigation of its waters or by any proclamation or other act attempted to
                    prohibit fishing or whaling within its limits beyond ordinary jurisdictional
                    waters. On the contrary, the treaties of 1824 and 1825 with the United States
                    and Great Britain, respectively, as well as the long-continued resort to its
                    waters without molestation of foreign whaling vessels in pursuit of their
                    calling, constitute acts of admission of the absence of any intent to claim a
                    right of prohibition to all men of the free use of its waters beyond the limits
                    of ordinary marine jurisdiction. The affidavits of Ezra B. Lapham, George O.
                    Baker, and B. D. Cleveland, submitted in evidence herewith, show that this sea
                    was a common resort for whalers.</p>
                <p>The captain of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> has stated in his
                    sworn affidavit, Exhibit H, and it is to be observed that his credibility is
                    vouched for by several witnesses of good standing, also under oath, that the
                    commander of the arresting Russian vessel declared at the time the seizure was
                    made that the Okhotsk Sea was a closed sea and that he had orders to seize all
                    vessels found taking whales therein and that the seizure of the bark in question
                    was made on that account.</p>
                <p>Were this declaration of the Russian commander, that the Okhotsk Sea is a sea
                    closed to the navigation and the pursuit in its open waters beyond ordinary
                    marine jurisdiction of the animals <hi rend="italic">feræ naturæ</hi>
                    frequenting it, supported by the claims of the Imperial Russian Government, it
                    is not easy to see how, in the light of present opinions on the subject of
                    ownership of the high seas, that claim could be maintained conformably to the
                    accepted principles of international law, even aside from the treaties of 1824
                    and 1825, made by the Imperial Russian Government and the United States and
                    Great Britain, respectively.</p>
                <p>The first article of the treaty with the United States, of 1824, reads as
                    follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It is agreed that, in any part of the great ocean commonly called the

                            either in navigation or in fishing, or in the power of resorting to the
                            coasts, upon points which may not have already been occupied, for the
                            purpose of trading with the natives, saving always the conditions

                <p>The first article of the treaty between the Imperial Russian Government and the

                <p>In rendering its decision the Paris tribunal of arbitration with regard to the
                    differences between the Governments of Great Britain and the United States a
                    majority of the abitrators adopted the following decision: <quote
                        rend="blockquote">
                        <p>By the ukase of 1821 Russia claimed jurisdiction in the sea known as the
                            Bering Sea to the extent of 100 Italian miles from the coast and islands
                            belonging to her, but in the course of the negotiations which led to the
                            conclusion of the treaties of 1824 with the United States, and of 1825
                            with Great Britain, Russia admitted that her jurisdiction in the said
                            sea should be restricted to the reach of a cannon shot from the shore,
                            and it appears that from that time up to the cession of Alaska to the
                            United States Russia never asserted in fact or exercised any exclusive
                            rights in the seal fisheries therein beyond the ordinary limit of
                            territorial waters.</p>
                    </quote></p>
                <p>In both of these treaties the expression employed is “in any part of the great
                    ocean commonly called the Pacific Ocean.” What did the decision of the tribunal
                    mean in this regard? The Bering Sea was and is as much separated from the main
                    ocean as was and is the Okhotsk Sea, and was and is equally distinguished
                    therefrom by name. Both are, however, branches of the great ocean, and the
                    decision which includes the waters of the one as part of that great body of
                    water must necessarily include the other.</p>
                <p>A claim of exclusive jurisdiction over gulfs of any such size and extent as the
                    Okhotsk Sea is not in accord with the consensus of opinion of the accepted
                    authorities on international law to-day. A very eminent authority upon the
                    subject has expressed the following view: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>In our day legislation and the opinions of jurists are in accord in
                            recognizing the liberty of the ocean, and no people could make
                            pretension of control thereof. Those portions of the sea which are
                            connected with the ocean are admitted to be free and accessible to all
                            the world, even when they are surrounded by the possessions of a single
                            State. Certain restrictions of this principle admitted in practice can
                            only be justified by the necessity of safeguarding the security of the
                            bordering country.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, from the present point of view, the sovereignty of a State
                            over the seas which bound it can not extend to a distance which would
                            deprive them of their character of open seas. Thus Sweden was in the
                            wrong in claiming sole possession of the Baltic. This sea, communicating
                            with the ocean as it does, ought always to remain open to all States. *
                            * *</p>
                        <p>The Sea of Kara can not be considered as belonging to Russia. With regard
                            to its geographical position a mere glance at the map shows that the Sea
                            of Kara communicates directly with the Arctic Ocean and that it is
                            entirely open to navigation. If it is alleged that it is covered with
                            ice during nine months of the year and that the ice forms a continuation
                            of Russian territory, it may be objected to that reasoning that ice has
                            never yet been likened to terra firma. Furthermore, the free use of that
                            sea might be necessary to other States for navigation during the three
                            months when it is not frozen. From the judicial point of view it is an
                            open sea. (F. de Martens, Traite de Droit International. Translated into

                <p>The opinion of the distinguished counsel for the Imperial Russian ministry of
                    foreign affairs regarding the Kara Sea applies with equal or even greater force
                    to the Okhotsk Sea, which is connected with an ocean much more frequented than
                    is the Arctic Ocean. Its waters are less closed to navigation by ice, and its
                    area is vastly greater than that of the Kara Sea.</p>

                <p>The American schooner <hi rend="italic">Washington</hi>, while engaged in fishing
                    in the Bay of Fundy, 10 miles distant from the shore, was seized by one of Her

                    on the ground that she was engaged in fishing in British waters in violation of
                    the provisions of the convention relative to the fisheries, entered into between
                    the United States and Great Britain on October 20, 1818. A claim for damages was
                    made before the commission of arbitration under the claims convention between
                    the United States and Great Britain of February 8, 1853, on the ground that the
                    seizure was in violation of the provisions of the convention of 1818 and of the
                    law of nations. Hornby, British commissioner, maintained that the seizure was
                    justified, both on the ground that the Bay of Fundy was an indention of the sea
                    over which Great Britain might by virtue of the law of nations claim
                    jurisdiction, and also on the ground that, by a fair construction of the
                    convention of 1818, the Bay of Fundy was one of the “bays” in which, by that
                    convention, the United States had renounced the right to fish. Upham, the
                    American commissioner, denied both these contentions, citing Vattel I, chapter
                    20, sections 282, 283; Grotius II, chapter 2, section 3; I Kent’s Commentaries,

                <p>Indeed, the Russian Government itself had admitted, by the issue of the notice to
                    whalers and sealers, which was copied into the New Bedford Whaleman’s Shipping
                    List (Exhibit 9 of Exhibit V), that her jurisdiction in the Okhotsk Sea did not
                    extend beyond ordinary jurisdictional waters. And the same admission is made in
                    the note of the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Envoy Extraordinary
                    and Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States at St Petersburg, dated July

                <p>In any case, however, the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> was quite
                    outside of any claimed Russian jurisdiction when the seizure was made. The map
                        <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0030"/>of the Okhotsk Sea, published by the
                    Russian Government, submitted in the evidence for the complainants, marked
                    “Exhibit W,” shows a line of demarcation which, as it forms a continuation of a
                    line which it was formerly claimed marked the partition of American and Russian
                    jurisdiction in the Bering Sea—an extent of jurisdiction which the Paris
                    tribunal of arbitration forever disposed of—it doubtless represents some former
                    pretension to jurisdiction, and clearly is the extreme limit to which
                    jurisdiction could be claimed under any theory. Now, the point at which the <hi
                        rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> was seized was outside of the waters on
                    the Russian side of this line. Moreover, the plotting of the course of the <hi

                    in the log book, show that after leaving Vladivostok she never again entered
                    Russian waters until she was brought there after the arrest, contrary to the
                    assertion of the Russian commission of inquiry.</p>
                <p>But, in point of fact, the Imperial Government of Russia has not attempted to
                    support the pretention that the seizure of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                        Pigeon</hi> was justifiable on the ground that that vessel had not the right
                    to fish for whales in the open sea of the Okhotsk Sea. On the contrary, it
                    appears from the note of the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the
                    Minister of the United States to Russia, dated June 12/24, 1893, submitted in
                    the evidence and marked “Exhibit I,” that the Imperial Government disclaimed any
                    such pretention to exclusive control, and, while admitting that the seizure was
                    not justified by the fact, puts the ground for such seizure upon certain
                    suspicions entertained by the Russian commander regarding the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> and her action.</p>
                <p>But whatever may have been the suspicions of the commander of the Russian vessel,
                    in acting upon them and seizing the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, he
                    assumed for his Government full responsibility for all damage directly resulting
                    therefrom, unless some wrongful act on the part of her occupants cognizable by
                    the Russian Government should be established.</p>
                <p>M. de Martens says (Traité de Droit International, Tome II, § 56, 3°, p. 342):

                    note of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of June 12 (24), 1893, above referred to
                    (Exhibit I), in latitude 46° 31′, longitude 146° 30’ east, a point 125 miles

                    out of Russian jurisdiction and engaged in her legitimate calling of whaling.
                    Her captain protested against her seizure and warned the commanding officer of
                    the Russian vessel that he would have to pay indemnity for the interruption of
                    his voyage, and the Russian officer replied that if he was wrong in making the

                <p>The right of innocent passage of fishing and merchant ships in marginal

                    of the amount of the damage sustained in this particular by striking an average
                    of the whales taken by him during his several previous voyages in the same
                    waters and deducting from the value of this average the value of the whales
                    already taken by him during the voyage in question. This was an eminently fair
                    and businesslike way of arriving at an estimate of the loss sustained by the
                    breaking up of the voyage. The claim is one for absolutely direct damages
                    arising out of the seizure, whereby a continuance of the whaling voyage was
                    rendered impossible owing to the lateness of the season, the impossibility of

                <p>The damages claimed for the loss of catch of a whaling ship in no sense
                    constitute claims for indirect damages or for speculative profits. They

                    it was too late to resume it during that year. They are such damages as are

                    capacity in carrying freight during the period of the detention, on the theory
                    that she can always resume her carrying trade, which has only suffered an
                    interruption not further affecting her earning capacity than as regards the mere
                    loss of time. But in the case of a whaling ship the entire earnings of the
                    vessel during an entire season depend upon her taking advantage of her
                    opportunity when it arrives, and the loss of her service at that moment may
                    deprive her owners of any return upon their investment during the whole year,
                    and her crew, who are paid by lay, of all remuneration for their labor for the
                    voyage and season. Thus the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> was gone for
                    very nearly a whole year and brought back an insufficient supply of oil and bone
                    to defray expenses, let alone make a profit, while her crew not only did not
                    make their wages, but remain in debt to the ship for advances made them.</p>
                <p>The rule of damages is well settled that in a fishing voyage the loss of the
                    service of a fishing vessel is to be compensated upon the value of the vessel’s
                    use during the time of her detention, and this depends upon the character and
                    employment of the vessel. The objection that prospective profits are not
                    admissible as a substantive ground of damage does not apply or exclude the use
                    of the average catch of a fishing vessel as evidence of the value of that
                    vessel’s use, but is the best evidence, exactly as it is the evidence used in
                    other cases to determine the injury suffered by a party from the deprivation of
                    the use of his property. The rule is particularly applicable to cases of whale
                    ships, because the crew, being paid by lay and having no ownership of the catch,
                    are to be compensated for their damages by their lay in the damages awarded
                    instead of being allowed to make separate independent claims for themselves.</p>
                <p>There is abundant evidence of the application of this rule in estimating the
                    measure of damage caused to a whaling ship by interference with the pursuit of
                    her calling, and it has always been justly considered that the crew, being
                    generally paid by lay or proportion of <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0033"
                    />the proceeds of the voyage, which involves special hardships and dangers, can
                    only be fairly compensated upon the basis of the estimated value to them of the
                    services of their ship and its equipment during the time of detention. The
                    owners also equip their vessels, at great expense, for long and perilous
                    voyages, in the expectation of commensurate returns in which they must divide
                    the proceeds with the crew, and their loss can only be estimated upon the basis
                    of the use of their ship and her crew and equipment for the purpose for which
                    she was sent out and not upon a percentage upon the capital invested or the
                    value in money of the ship if put to other uses. The only criterion applicable,
                    therefore, is the average catch.</p>

                        <p>In order to make full compensation and indemnity for what has been lost

                    Court of the United States, Mr. Justice Nelson, in delivering the opinion of the
                    court, said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>As to the question of damages, the jury were instructed, if they found
                            for the plaintiffs, to give damages that would remunerate them for the
                            loss necessarily incurred in raising the boat and repairing her, and
                            also for the use of the boat during the time necessary to make the
                            repairs and fit her for business.</p>
                        <p>By the use of the boat, we understand what she would produce to the
                            plaintiffs by the hiring or chartering of her to run upon the river in
                            the business in which she had been usually engaged.</p>
                        <p>The general rule in regulating damages in cases of collision is to allow
                            the injured party an indemnity to the extent of the loss sustained. This
                            rule is obvious enough, but there is a good deal of difficulty in
                            stating the grounds upon which to arrive, in all cases, at the proper
                            measure of that indemnity.</p>
                        <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0034"/>
                        <p>The expenses of raising the boat and of repairs may of course be readily
                            ascertained, and in respect to repairs no deduction is to be made, as in
                            insurance cases, for the new materials in place of the old. The
                            difficulty lies in estimating the damage sustained by the loss of
                            service of the vessel while she is undergoing the repairs.</p>
                        <p>That an allowance short of some compensation for this loss would fail to
                            be an indemnity for the injury is apparent. This question was directly
                            before the court of admiralty in England in the case of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Gazelle</hi>, decided by Dr. Lushington in 1844, 2 W.
                            Robinson, 279. That was a case of collision, and in deciding it the
                            court observed: “That the party who has suffered the injury is clearly
                            entitled to an adequate compensation for any loss he may sustain for the
                            detention of the vessel during the period which is necessary for the
                            completion of the repairs and furnishing the new articles.”</p>
                        <p>In fixing the amount of the damages to be paid for the detention, the
                            court allowed the gross freight, deducting so much as would in ordinary
                            cases be disbursed on account of the ship’s expenses in earning it.</p>
                        <p>This rule may afford a very fair indemnity in cases where the repairs are
                            completed within the period usually occupied in the voyage in which the
                            freight is to be earned. But if a longer period is required it obviously
                            falls short of an adequate allowance. It looks to the capacity of the
                            vessel to earn freight, for the benefit of the owner, and consequent
                            loss while deprived of her service. In other words, to the amount she
                            would earn him on hire. (13 Howard, 101.)</p>

                <p>This subject has recently undergone the most thorough and careful examination by
                    the commission appointed to adjust the claims of the <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25"
                        facs="0035"/>Canadian sealers against the Government of the United States,
                    commonly known as the Bering Sea claims. It is scarcely necessary to do more
                    than to refer to the arguments submitted before this tribunal on behalf of the
                    English Government for the most complete and exhaustive review of all the
                    decisions upon the subject.</p>
                <p>The English Government contended for the rule as claimed in the present case. An
                    examination of the awards made in certain cases before the Bering Sea Commission
                    leaves no room for doubt that in these cases at least the Commission adopted the
                    rule as contended for by the English Government, and as herein stated. For
                    instance, in case No. 4—the <hi rend="italic">Favorite</hi>—the award was
                    $3,202. The claim was $6,202, of which $5,600 was for the value of the estimated
                    earnings from catch. The interest of Alexander McLean, one-half, was thrown out
                    by the Commission, reducing this claim to $2,800. The item of $200, time and
                    expense of owners, was also thrown out as being a duplicate, and thus the claim
                    of $6,202 was reduced to $3,202, for which the award was made, and which
                    included $2,800 belonging to the owner, not excluded for the estimated earnings
                    of the vessel based upon an estimated catch. The same is true of the case of the

                    one-half ownership being thrown out, and it appears that at least $8,428 must
                    have been estimated for catch. The same is also true of No. 13, the <hi

                        rend="italic">Triumph</hi>, where the sole claim was for loss of catch. In
                    the case of the <hi rend="italic">Triumph</hi>, No. 14, not No. 11 for the same
                    vessel, the award was $15,500. The original claim was for $19,624, of which $250
                    was for legal and other expenses, $19,424 being for balance of estimated catch
                    of 2,500 skins, at $8 each. It was admitted that the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Triumph</hi> had transshipped her part of her season’s catch before
                    entering Bering Sea on or about July 4. A considerable part of the season had
                    already therefore elapsed, and it was reasonable to suppose that she had taken a
                    fifth part of her probable catch before entering Bering Sea. Thus 2,000 skins
                    would remain to be taken to make up the season’s work of 2,500 skins. She had on
                    board 72 skins when taken, leaving 1,928 skins to be taken to make up the 2,000.
                    One thousand nine hundred and twenty-eight skins at $8 would amount to $15,424,
                    and the award was for $15,450, as has been said. There is no possible escape
                    from the demonstration which this case affords, that this was the rule adapted
                    by the Bering Sea Commission, and a careful examination of each case shows that
                    the rule was universally applied.</p>
                <p>It is believed that the principle that an agent of a government may not
                    rightfully, upon the mere suspicion of an act of trespass, enter upon a
                    peaceably engaged ship, sailing under the flag of a friendly nation, and by
                    force of arms enroll the citizens or subjects of that friendly nation into the
                    public service of that government against their wills and oblige them to
                    navigate one of that government’s national ships will not be disputed. Hall,
                    citing Bluntcheli, says (International Law, Fourth Edition, Part II, Chap. IV,
                    p. 217): <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It is not permissible to enroll aliens, except with their own consent, in
                            a force intended to be used for ordinary national or political
                            objects.</p>
                    </quote></p>
                <p>Such an act is an unwarrantable aggression not only upon the flag <pb n="26"
                        xml:id="pg_26" facs="0036"/>of the friendly nation but of usurpation of
                    authority over the citizens of another nationality wholly at variance with the
                    rights of the individuals, and which no government would attempt to practice
                    upon <hi rend="italic">terra firma.</hi></p>
                <p>The act of compulsion over the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                        Pigeon</hi> in taking them from their own ship and by force of arms obliging
                    them, under protest, to navigate a Russian vessel into port, must be considered
                    as, apart from any right or want of it to seize the vessel, a grave infraction
                    of their natural rights. As American citizens no official of the Russian
                    Government could by right compel them against their wills to enter into the
                    service, even temporarily, of the Russian Government. And in doing so the
                    commander of the Russian cruiser laid his Government open to a just claim for
                    damages in excess of the mere value of the labor performed. The fact that these
                    seamen, unprovided with any competent counsel to advise them of their rights,
                    agreed at Vladivostok to accept the mere value of the labor performed in
                    acquittance of any claim for this arbitrary act of impressment should not be
                    permitted to prejudice their claims not only for the services performed but for
                    indemnity for the injury to their national pride and for the violation of their
                    personal liberty.</p>
                <p>Futhermore, these men were landed on the beach at Vladivostok and left unprovided
                    for either as regards food or shelter, nor was any suitable provision offered
                    them, so that they were compelled to take refuge in the squalid quarters of a
                    Chinaman significantly called “Cheap John.” It is claimed by the Russian
                    Government that quarters were offered them in the jail. Such a lodgment, if it
                    was in fact offered them, can hardly be deemed as suitable or adequate for
                    self-respecting and innocent citizens of a friendly nation, innocent of any
                    wrong, who have been brought to a distant port and compelled to await in
                    enforced idleness permission to resume their occupation. It is confidently
                    believed that full indemnity will be allowed these men for both these wrongs in
                    the final award.</p>
                <p>In cases of this nature the principle of allowing a fair rate of interest upon
                    the award is so universally admitted as to preclude the necessity of argument
                    upon the subject. In his award in favor of the <hi rend="italic">John S.
                        Bryan</hi> for the payment of interest upon the amount of indemnity due from
                    the Brazilian Government the arbitrator stated: “The principle on which this sum
                    is awarded is one which has long been settled.”</p>
                <p>Among the many cases in which tribunals of arbitration have allowed interest in
                    their awards may be cited the following:</p>
                <p>The commission under the treaty of 1794, between the United States and Great
                    Britain, allowed interest on all claims.</p>
                <p>In the Chinese indemnity arbitration the commission allowed interest at the rate
                    of 12 per cent.</p>
                <p>The decisions of the American and British claims commission under the treaty of
                    May 8, 1871, included interest in their awards with a very few exceptions. The
                    Geneva tribunal of arbitration upon the Alabama claims, the dissenting opinion
                    of Sir Alexander Cockburn shows that interest at the rate of 6 per cent was
                    allowed in the award.</p>
                <p>So also in the arbitration of the claims of the United States against Mexico and
                    against Brazil.</p>
                <p>In the case of the <hi rend="italic">Costa Rica Packet</hi> the distinguished
                    arbitrator allowed the claimants interest at the rate of 5 per cent.</p>
                <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0037"/>
                <p>In the recent arbitration (1897) between the United States of America and Great
                    Britain, for claims growing out of the Bering Sea seizures, interest was
                    universally allowed.</p>

                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">general statement of the claims</hi>.</p>
                <p>The number of whales already taken was the basis of Captain Scullun’s estimate as
                    his average catch. On this season alone in the conditions in which the vessel
                    was at the time of the seizure he could fairly have claimed a much larger
                    number, but he knew that in four seasons he had taken 28 whales, making for
                    those seasons an average of 7, and with this season’s catch he could fairly
                    raise the average to 8, making the deduction which he did of $1,800. The
                    captains whose affidavits are presented put the average catch from 6 to 10
                    whales, and their evidence shows that Captain Scullun’s estimate of 8 whales is
                    reasonable.</p>
                <p>The average amount of bone to a whale is based on the two whales which Captain
                    Scullun had taken and for which credit is given. The evidence of the other
                    captains shows that in their experience the whales which they had taken averaged
                    a little less bone, between 1,100 and 1,200 pounds to a whale, but it is to be
                    remembered that Captain Scullun was there on the ground and saw the whales, and
                    the others are speaking of previous years. Captain Scullun’s deduction brings it
                    down to about 1,250 pounds, which, under all the circumstances, renders the
                    claim well supported by the proof.</p>
                <p>The average of 100 barrels of oil to a whale is proved by all the witnesses and
                    is a well known average for this class of whales. The price of the bone is shown
                    by the testimony of Mr. Wing and Mr. Philips and the prices current in the
                    market. Bone had ruled at $5 <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0038"/>a pound
                    during August. In September the price was affected by the catch and fell to
                    $4.25 by the 1st of October. This was the October price and was maintained into
                    November; but by the 1st of December the price further declined to $4. The
                    seizure was on the 10th of September, and the claimants are entitled to the
                    August price, which, so far as appears, rules until that date, for the testimony
                    shows that the catch would have been sold “to arrive” at the market rate. The
                    price of oil is entirely established by the testimony at $13 a barrel.</p>
                <p>The claim is submitted, therefore, upon this item, as well established by the
                    proof, at $45,000.</p>
                <p>II. Indemnity for impressment of crew of American citizens into the naval service
                    of Russia.</p>
                <p>The claim is $1,000 per man for 31 men, $31,000.</p>
                <p>This claim was not included in the claim presented by Captain Scullun. He was
                    only a whaling master and not a lawyer versed in the rules of international law.
                    His affidavit shows that he felt to the full the indignity which his flag had
                    suffered and the outrage which had been perpetrated on himself and his crew. He
                    shows in his testimony his just indignation at the invasion of his and their
                    rights and the cruel treatment which they received not only at the time of the
                    seizure, but from the abandonment at Vladivostok. They were told that they were
                    to be provided for at the station house like common criminals, but even that
                    refuge from hunger and exposure was denied them, and Captain Scullun had himself
                    to provide quarters for them in a storehouse, and for days they were put off
                    with one excuse and another until they were finally sent back to their own ship
                    without even an apology, and there rested again safely under the flag of their
                    country. The grounds of the claim, as based upon the well-known principles of
                    international law, are set forth in the memorandum, and its allowance is asked
                    in the name of the United States. There were 34, all told, on the <hi
                        rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, and all but Captain Scullun, his
                    steward, and boy (3) were put on board the schooner, making 31 officers and men.
                    The rate per man has been fixed at $1,000 in the claim. It is not a subject of
                    argument, and must be left to the justice of the arbitrator. It is not to be
                    measured by the physical injury or even by the mental suffering of the men, but
                    by what one great, rich, and powerful national should pay to another for an
                    outrage which invaded not only the rights, but the self-respect of the
                    sufferers. It is to be remembered that this was not the act of the respondent
                    nation, but only that of its subjects, for which, however, international law
                    holds it responsible. In such a case a nation, instead of resisting payment,
                    should be eager to make full restitution.</p>
                <p>III. Services of the crew in navigating the Russian schooner.</p>
                <p>This was enforced labor, which was beneficial to the respondent nation, as it
                    enabled them to bring both vessels to Vladivostok. The claim is at the rate of
                    $10 a day for the officers and $5 a day for the men, thus: <table rows="3"

                <p>While the rate per day is more than such men would ordinarily earn, it is not
                    excessive under the circumstances. It may be fairly viewed as analagous to
                    salvage.</p>

                <p>IV. The other items are these:</p>
                <p>Provisions on the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> consumed by the 2
                    Russian officers and 12 Russian men on the voyage to Vladivostok, $200.</p>
                <p>The voyage lasted nine days, as Captain Scullun testifies that the schooner
                    arrived three days before the ship.</p>
                <p>Board of crew at Vladivostok, $210. This covered the support of 9 officers and 22
                    men for fourteen days, $50. At the time Captain Scullen made his claim at
                    Vladivostok the last two sums had to be estimated. The exact figures are found
                    in Mr. Wing’s testimony, the first being a part of the ($268.46 plus $17.04)
                    $285.50 paid Cheap Jack, and the latter a part of Captain Scullun’s board bill
                    of $42 and carriage and boat hire of $30.</p>
                <p>V. Amount claimed for general expenses, $3,040.</p>
                <p>Mr. Wing has annexed to his deposition a statement of his expense account due to
                    the seizure, amounting to $1,519.47, from which should be deducted the $210 plus
                    $50=$260, claimed in paragraph IV, and leaving $1,259.47 already expended, in
                    addition to which a much larger sum than the balance of $1,780.53 will be needed
                    to defray his expenses in the proof of this claim. As the Russian Government has
                    admitted its liability from the beginning, and yet has never offered to pay even
                    an approximately fair compensation for the claim covering that of the owners,
                    officers, and crew, both private and international law require that an allowance
                    should be made to cover the claimant’s expenses, in order that he may have “<hi
                        rend="italic">restitutio in integrum</hi>.”</p>
                <p>VI. Interest.</p>
                <p>As shown in the memorandum, interest is to be allowed at the rate of 6 per cent
                    per annum from the date of seizure. The decision in the Bering Sea cases, cited
                    in the memorandum, exhausts the law upon this subject and obviates the need of
                    argument. The commission say in their award— <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The rate of interest awarded by us is 6 per cent per annum, being the
                            statutory rate at Victoria, British Columbia, during the period could,
                            but being less than the current rate thereat.</p>
                    </quote></p>
                <p>And upon each award the interest was figured as a separate item.</p>
                <p>Thus, as to the claim of the vessel <hi rend="italic">Dolphin</hi>, it is
                    adjudged and determined that the United States of America are liable to Great
                    Britain in respect thereof, and we assess and award the amount of compensation
                    to be paid on account thereof to Great Britain on behalf of the owners, master,
                    officers, and crew of the vessel, as follows, that is to say, $31,484 with
                    interest from September 10, 1887, until this day, amounting to the sum of
                    $19,399.38, and making a total of principal and interest of the sum of
                    $50,883.38.</p>
                <p>Of the gross award of $473,151.26 paid by the United States, $172,962.35 was for
                    interest.</p>

                            or seaman through the night, whether on shore or on board of any other
                            vessel; every instance of the introduction of any woman or women into
                            the ship for licentious purposes; every instance of disability for
                            ship’s duty which may occur, with the cause of it—if occasioned by
                            sickness or infirmity, the nature and origin of the same, if known, to
                            be particularly stated, especially if it be the consequence of their own
                            misconduct. And in the case of the officer who may usually <pb n="34"
                                xml:id="pg_34" facs="0044"/>have charge of the log book being
                            implicated in any of the misdemeanors or disabilities herein mentioned
                            it shall be the duty of the master to make, or cause to be made by
                            another hand, an entry of the same on the log book. And it shall be the
                            duty of the master to see that a proper record is kept therein of all
                            the matters mentioned in this article, according to its true intent and
                            meaning.</p>
                        <p>4. The officer having charge of the watch on deck for the time being
                            shall be responsible for the maintenance of the regulation in regard to
                            the admission of women, and in case of any getting on board unperceived
                            they shall forthwith be expelled by him, or, if not able to do so, the
                            case shall be immediately reported to the captain or commanding officer
                            on board, whose duty it shall be to enforce their immediate expulsion.
                            On the failure of any officer on this part of his duty, either wilfully
                            or through negligence, each and every officer so failing shall forfeit
                            twenty days’ pay for every such offense; and any other officer or seaman
                            who shall abet any breach of said regulation, or refuse, when lawfully
                            called upon to aid in sustaining it, or shall be proved to have had a
                            criminal intercourse with any such woman or women on board, shall
                            forfeit for every such offense five days’ pay; for every instance of
                            drunkenness two days’ pay shall be forfeited, and a similar forfeiture
                            shall take place for each day that any officer or seaman shall be off
                            duty from sickness or disability caused by intemperance or
                            licentiousness; the forfeitures in all these cases to be estimated as in
                            the second article, and to go to the use of the owners of said bark.</p>
                        <p>5. All expenses which may be necessarily incurred during the voyage, with
                            direct reference to any of the misdemeanors or disabilities enumerated
                            in the third article, or to any attempt at desertion or other
                            disobedient and mutinous conduct, shall be charged to the individual or
                            individuals by reason of whom they may have been incurred.</p>
                        <p>6. It is further agreed that if any officer or seaman, after a fair
                            trial, if his abilities and disposition shall be judged by the master
                            incompetent or indisposed to the proper discharge of the duties of his
                            station, the master shall have a right to displace him and substitute
                            another in his stead; a corresponding reduction of the lay of such
                            officer or seaman, with reference to the duty which he may thereafter
                            perform, thenceforth to take effect; and a reasonable increase of the
                            lay of the individual who may thereupon be promoted to a higher station
                            shall be made on the final adjustment of the voyage.</p>
                        <p>7. It is understood and agreed that if any officer or seaman shall be
                            prevented by sickness or death from performing the voyage, his legal
                            representatives shall be entitled to such part of the whole amount of
                            his stipulated share as the time of his services on board shall be of
                            the whole term of the voyage.</p>
                        <p>8. It is further agreed that whatever apparel, furniture, or stores
                            belonging to said vessel may be given in charge by the master to any
                            officer or seaman shall be accounted for by him; and in case anything
                            should be lost or damaged through his carelessness or neglect it shall
                            be made good to the owners by such officer or seaman. And whatever
                            officer or seaman the master shall appoint for the duty shall take
                            charge of any portion of the cargo or ship’s stores required to be
                            landed or brought on board in any boats or lighter, and faithfully
                            perform the services assigned, and see that the said cargo or stores are
                            safely landed and delivered, or brought on board the said vessel, as the
                            case may be.</p>
                        <p>9. Each and every officer and seaman who shall have well and truly
                            performed the above-mentioned voyage, complied with the regulations and
                            duties herein specified, and committed no dishonest or unlawful acts,
                            shall, on the return of said vessel to the port of San. Francisco, be
                            entitled to be, and shall be, settled with and paid in San Francisco his
                            share of the catch of said vessel at the following rates: Whale oil at
                            20 cents per gallon; sperm oil at 40 cents per gallon; whalebone (in
                            case the total catch of the whole whaling fleet of vessels sailing from
                            or arriving at ports on the Pacific coast for the season in the Arctic
                            shall exceed 200 whales) at 1 dol. 25 c. per lb., but in case said total
                            catch shall not exceed 200 whales, then at 1 dol. 50 c. per lb; said
                            settlement to be made for oil at the above-named rates, and bone at 1
                            dol. 25 c. per lb., as soon after the return of the ship as the quantity
                            of her oil and bone can be ascertained, and the 25 cents per lb. in
                            addition thereto as soon as it shall be ascertained that the total catch
                            of the whole of said fleet does not exceed 200 whales.</p>
                        <p>10. In testimony of our assent, consent, and agreement faithfully to
                            perform the various duties and obligations implied in the preceding
                            articles, and an acknowledgment of their being voluntary and without any
                            compulsory or clandestine means being used, we have each and everyone of
                            us severally hereunto affixed our names on the day and year against them
                            respectively written. And it is hereby understood and mutually agreed,
                            by and between the parties aforesaid, that they, the said seamen and
                            mariners, will render themselves on board the said vessel on or before,
                            as <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0045"/>ordered by the master, ——, the
                            —— day of ——, at — o’clock, in the ——noon.</p>
                        <p>No distilled spirituous liquor will be put on board the vessel by the
                            owner, except for strictly medical use; and by their signatures the
                            other parties to this contract pledge themselves not to take any of
                            those articles with them, as their private stores or for traffic, either
                            from this port or from any other port or place where they may be during
                            the voyage. And in case of a violation of this pledge by the master, or
                            any officer or seaman, his entire share of the voyage shall be thereupon
                            forfeited to the use of the owners of the said vessel.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Envoy</hi>: In reply to the letter which you had
                            the goodness to address me, dated May 3 (15) last, I have the honor to
                            communicate to you the following data upon the inquiry, made by a
                            commission appointed by the commandant of the Pacific squadron, on the
                            subject of the arrest of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>,
                            flying the American flag, in the Sea of Okhotsk.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant of the Imperial navy von Cube, commanding the English schooner
                                <hi rend="italic">Maria</hi>, seized for illegal sealing in Russian
                            waters, encountered the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> on the
                            night of August 20 (September 10), 1892, at 46° 31′ north latitude, 146°
                            30’ longitude east. The latter having made signals which seemed to him
                            suspicious, Lieutenant von Cube invited Captain Scullen, of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, to come on board of his vessel.
                            He declared that he was engaged in whaling in the Sea of Okhotsk, but an
                            examination of the log book and charts caused Lieutenant von Cube to
                            believe that the whaler in question had visited Aniva and Patience bays,
                            where fishing is forbidden to foreign vessels, and decided him to take
                            the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> to Vladivostok in order to
                            establish whether he had a right to navigate those waters.</p>
                        <p>You must admit, Mr. Envoy, that this version differs materially from that
                            of Captain Scullun, according to which he had been arrested for having
                            engaged in whaling in the Sea of Okhotsk, which he says Lieutenant von
                            Cube considered closed to foreign whalers.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless the commission of investigation to which this case was
                            referred, while stating also that the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                                Pigeon</hi> had navigated within Russian territorial waters, found
                            no cause to order her confiscation. It was then admitted that the arrest
                            of this vessel had been made as the result of a misunderstanding, and
                            the vessel was returned to her owners without delay.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the indemnity claimed by the latter, it is sufficient to
                            point to the figures $45,000 profit, representing the price of five
                            whales, alleged to have been lost by the interruption of her voyage, to
                            demonstrate the exaggerated estimate of Captain Scullen.</p>

                        <p>This last point in particular requires the production of vouchers, in
                            default of which the Imperial ministry of marine could by no means admit
                            the justice of all its items. The said ministry supposes that in a
                            general way, apart from this, the sum of $2,500 represents a just and
                            sufficient indemnification for the real losses sustained by Captain
                            Scullen and his crew by reason of the temporary detention of the <hi

                        <p>I will only mention in passing the allegation of Captain Scullun to the
                            effect that the authorities at Vladivostok left him and his men, at the
                            end of the affair, without lodging or food, Mr. Wurts, then chargé
                            d’affaires of the United States, having himself done justice to this
                            allegation in his letter of September 9/21, 1892. I confine myself to
                            the statement that, according to the testimony of the superior
                            authorities of the Navy, it was Captain Scullun himself who declined for
                            himself and his crew the lodgings and food offered to them, according to
                            custom, by the authorities at Vladivostok.</p>
                        <p>Please to accept, Mr. Envoy, the assurance of my most distinguished

                            then in latitude 46° 30’, longitude 146° 35’, and 125 miles off Sagalien

                            ship was confiscated for whaling in Okhotsk Sea, which was closed.
                            Officer and armed men then took possession of my ship, ordering my
                            officers and crew to take the schooner to Vladivostok, which they did,

                            your excellency with the contents of a telegram received by me last
                            night, as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Vladivostok, September 8. Bark <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>,
                            of New Bedford,” etc. (See telegram on file.)</p>

                            to be made into the circumstances of the seizure of the vessel above
                            indicated for report to the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>In the meanwhile I beg your excellency to have the kindness to direct
                            that proper help be extended by the authorities at Vladivostok to the
                            master and crew of this vessel. I trust and believe that the description
                            in the telegram of their condition, “without food or shelter,” is an
                            exaggeration, for it is not the custom of the Imperial authorities or of
                            the Russian people to refuse assistance called for by persons <pb n="40"

                        <p>Q. Your name is George O. Baker?—A. Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. Of Dartmouth?—A. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Q. Master mariner?—A. Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. How old?—A. 58.</p>
                        <p>Q. When did you first go to sea?—A. 1848.</p>
                        <p>Q. As what?—A. Cabin boy.</p>
                        <p>Q. And from there all through up to master?—A. Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. How many voyages master?—A. I have been master since 1863.</p>
                        <p>Q. How many voyages in round numbers?—A. About 15 voyages.</p>
                        <p>Q. And where?—A. All my first going to sea was New Zealand and coast of
                            Chile. The last six years in the Ochotsk Sea and Japan Sea.</p>
                        <p>Q. Had a large experience in the Ochotsk and Japan seas?—A. As much as
                            any one would have going there six years running.</p>
                        <p>Q. Now, Captain, when does the season in the Ochotsk open—when do you
                            look for the opening?—A. We look for it about the middle of August.</p>
                        <p>Q. How late do you stay there?—A. Until the 10th or 12th of October.</p>
                        <p>Q. What makes you go away?—A. The weather getting a little rough.</p>
                        <p>Q. Are they northerly or southerly winds that set in?—A. Mostly northerly
                            and easterly.</p>
                        <p>Q. And they commence about the 12th of October?—A. About the middle of
                            October it commences to be very rugged.</p>
                        <p>Q. Then the season there lasts from about the middle of August until the
                            middle of October?—A. Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. I suppose it varies with seasons—sometimes commences later and
                            sometimes earlier?—A. Yes, sir; Captain Whiteside cruised up there until
                            the 15th of November. I have read his abstracts.</p>
                        <p>Q. How often does that happen?—A. I have read in his abstracts that he
                            cruised there until the 15th of November, and Captain B—— caught a whale
                            there as late as the 9th of October. That is as late as I know of a
                            whale being caught there.</p>
                        <p>Q. What is the weather that you call rugged?—A. Well, when we have
                            continuous gales. Have it perhaps moderate one day, and have bad weather
                            for a week so that we couldn’t lower for whales.</p>
                        <p>Q. So that it would be practically useless to continue whaling after this
                            rugged weather sets in?—A. Yes, sir; it would be unpleasant.</p>
                        <p>Q. In regard to the season from the middle of August to the middle of
                            October, when is the best part of that season for whales?—A. From the
                            1st of September up to the 20th I have seen my best whaling. One season,
                            the 18th of September, I lost all my boats. That was when the rugged
                            weather began earlier.</p>
                        <p>Q. What should you say as to the August whaling compared with that of the
                            September?—A. The September whaling is the best. It is just like
                            this—one season the whales might strike by the middle of August and
                            leave the 25th of September, and another time they might strike earlier
                            or later, according to the feed there. September we call the best time
                            for whaling in the southern part of the Ochotsk Sea.</p>
                        <p>Q. You know the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon ?</hi>—A. Yes, sir;
                            was in her eight years.</p>
                        <p>Q. Who was the agent then?—A. William Potter, 2d.</p>
                        <p>Q. And you sailed for him eight years?—A. Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. Well now, Captain, what should you say would be a fair average catch
                            of whales in the Ochotsk Sea for a season; what should you expect,
                            getting up there the 10th or 15th of August and staying until the 10th
                            of October?—A. Seven or eight or ten whales. I should go there with that
                            expectation.</p>
                        <p>Q. That, you think from your experience, would be fair?—A. Yes, sir;
                            anywhere from six to ten.</p>
                        <p>Q. Suppose you were in the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> and
                            were at Vladivostok on the 1st of October, and the northerly winds and
                            rugged weather had commenced, would you consider it expedient to return
                            to the whaling grounds in the Ochotsk Sea?—A. No, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. Why not?—A. Because I should think that by the time I got to the
                            Ochotsk Sea the season would be about up. I should leave for San
                            Francisco.</p>
                        <p>Q. It would be useless to go back there?—A. Yes it would take eight or
                            ten days to get there, and then it would be the middle of October, and I
                            think it would be useless. Of course a man might accidentally take a
                            whale.</p>
                        <p>Q. You wouldn’t think of making a return?—A. No, sir; I should come down
                            direct for San Francisco.</p>
                        <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0052"/>
                        <p>Q. What would 9 whales make in oil and bone? What would be the
                            average?—A. Ten thousand pounds of bone and 900 barrels of oil. It might
                            make more, but it would be pretty sure to make that. About 1, 100 pounds
                            of bone to a whale, and 100 barrels of oil.</p>
                        <p>Q. What is the species?—A. Right whales; the same as they catch here in
                            the South Atlantic. Not a bow head.</p>

                        <p>Q. What has been your experience with regard to the weather there? What
                            is the season in the Ochotsk?—A. Well, I found the season from about the
                            middle of August to the 1st of October.</p>
                        <p>Q. What ends the season?—A. Well, we experienced a great deal of
                            northerly and easterly winds, gales, making it very rugged indeed, so
                            that we did not consider it suitable to put boats in the water. And
                            another thing, our experience at this time was that the feed seemed to
                            have gone; there were never any whales to be seen.</p>
                        <p>Q. The whales follow the feed?—A. Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. And the feed seems to disappear?—A. Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. So that you would say from the middle of August to the 1st of October
                            was the whaling season in the Okhotsk?—A. Yes, sir; to the last of
                            September.</p>
                        <p>Q. And what do you consider the best part?—A. Our best time was from the
                            1st of September to the 18th. It was the principal part in our two
                            seasons.</p>
                        <p>Q. Do you know the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon;</hi> did you ever
                            sail in her?—A. No, sir; but I have cruised with her and know her
                            well.</p>
                        <p>Q. What should you say was a fair average catch for a season in the
                            Okhotsk?—A. Well, I always went there with an expectation of from 6 to
                            10 whales.</p>
                        <p>Q. And how would these whales average?—A. Well, those I got for two
                            seasons in succession, from 1,100 to 1,150 pounds of bone to a
                            whale.</p>
                        <p>Q. These estimates are based upon your own experience and what you have
                            actually done, Captain?—A. Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. And about the oil?—A. Well, I consider that most of those whales to go
                            just about 100 barrels of oil.</p>
                        <p>Q. Some larger and some smaller?—A. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Q. Could you make an average out of 7 or 8 whales? Would 7 or 8 whales
                            average that?—A. That is a general average.</p>
                        <p>Q. That would apply to a season’s work as well as to several season’s
                            work?—A. Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. Suppose, Captain, you were at Vladivostok on the 1st day of October
                            with the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> and the northerly winds
                            and rugged weather had already set it, would you consider it expedient
                            to return to the Okhotsk for whaling?—A. No, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. What should you do?—A. Go directly for San Francisco.</p>
                        <p>Q. Why?—A. Because I should certainly consider then that the rugged
                            weather had set in, and that it would not be using good judgment to go
                            there and attempt to get a season’s work after that date. The two
                            seasons that I have been there I have always left the 1st day of
                            October. There were four ships there both seasons that I was there, and
                            I stayed as late as any ship.</p>
                        <p>Q. I suppose the seasons vary; some are more open than others?—A. Yes,
                            sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. Do you know the place where the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                                Pigeon</hi> was seized?—A. Very nearly, I think.</p>
                        <p>Q. How long would it take to go from Vladivostok there if the northerly
                            winds had set in?—A. It would certainly take twelve days, any ship.</p>
                        <p>Q. What were the two seasons you were in the Okhotsk?—A. 1889 and 1890. I
                            did all my business in the Okhotsk Sea; from the 28th of August until
                            the 14th of September I did all my whaling.</p>

                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Captain Lapham.</hi></p>
                        <p>Q. What is your full name, Captain?—A. Ezra B. Lapham.</p>
                        <p>Q. Where do you live?—A. South Dartmouth.</p>
                        <p>Q. What is your age?—A. Forty-nine.</p>
                        <p>Q. Where did you commence going to sea, before the mast?—A. Yes, sir;
                            before the mast.</p>
                        <p>Q. How old were you?—A. Thirteen and one-half years.</p>
                        <p>Q. Have you been to sea ever since?—A. Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. All the way from the forecastle to captain of a ship?—A. Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. How many voyages did you make as master?—A. I commenced to go as
                            master in ’76, and have been every year but two or three since that
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Q. Where have you been as master?—A. Mostly in the North Pacific. Have
                            been in the Okhotsk Sea and Japan Sea two seasons.</p>
                        <p>Q. How many times in the Okhotsk?—A. Two seasons.</p>
                        <p>Q.-What seasons were those?—A. ’86 and ’87.</p>
                        <p>Q. What is the season in the Okhotsk?—A. I went in July, about the 25th,
                            and I stopped there until the 10th of October one year. One year I came
                            out the 28th of September, but I was sick that time.</p>
                        <p>Q. What did you come away for; what were the reasons?—A. We calculated
                            the season was about up the 10th of October.</p>
                        <p>Q. Did the northerly winds and rugged weather set in?—A. Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. And the season would last until the bad weather set in?—A. Until the
                            bad weather set in.</p>
                        <p>Q. That is generally about the first part of October?—A. Yes, sir;
                            anywhere from the first to the middle. Sometimes they stop until the
                            30th, but very seldom.</p>
                        <p>Q. Do you know where Vladivostok is?—A. Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. When is the best part of the season? You say the season lasts from the
                            1st of August until the 1st of October. What is the best part of that
                            season?—A. Well, I found it the best——I did the most of my whaling in
                            August, but one year I struck whales up to the 4th of October. I struck
                            two whales on the 4th of October, but didn’t save either of them. I
                            consider September the best month.</p>
                        <p>Q. Do you know the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon?</hi>—A. Yes; she
                            was there the time I was there.</p>
                        <p>Q. Whom have you sailed for?—A. I. H. Bartlett, William C. N. Swift,
                            Thomas Nye.</p>
                        <p>Q. Do you know the size of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                            Pigeon?</hi>—A. Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. What should you say was a fair, average catch for a season in the
                            Okhotsk?—A. That depends a good deal on the season. Some seasons are
                            better than others.</p>
                        <p>Q. What should you expect going in there with the <hi rend="italic">Cape
                                Horn Pigeon</hi>—what should you think was a fair average catch?—A.
                            I should say 10 whales.</p>
                        <p>Q. You don’t always get 10 whales?—A. No; but that is always what I go
                            for; always calculate that that is a good, fair catch.</p>
                        <p>Q. But you feel pretty sure of getting 6 or 7?—A. Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. You wouldn’t go unless you thought you were going to get 6 or 7?—A.
                            No, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. Suppose you were at Vladivostok with the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                                Pigeon</hi> on the 1st day of October, and the northerly winds and
                            rugged weather had commenced, would you consider it expedient to return
                            to the whaling grounds in the Okhotsk Sea?—A. No, sir; I shouldn’t give
                            it the second thought. I should leave, certainly.</p>
                        <p>Q. Why?—A. Because the season is about up by that time. By the time you
                            got there the season would be gone. Still, of course a ship could go
                            there and take her chances.</p>
                        <p>Q. You wouldn’t get there until it was time to leave—until after the
                            rugged weather had set in?—A. No, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. How long would it take, if the northerly winds had set in, to go from
                            Vladivostok to where the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> was
                            seized?—A. Well, I should think it would take ten days.</p>
                        <p>Q. So that by the time you got there the season would be practically
                            over?—A. Practically, yes.</p>
                        <p>Q. About what do those whales in the Okhotsk make—oil and bone?—A. Well,
                            you take a whale making 100 barrels of oil and you will get 1,100 pounds
                            of bone.</p>
                        <p>Q. That is rather recognized as the average of those whales, isn’t it?—A.
                            Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. The question of when the best whaling is, I suppose, depends upon when
                            the whales strike in; it may be August or September?—A. Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Q. It depends a good deal on the feed?—A. Yes, sir; a good deal.</p>
                        <p>Q. The whales follow the feed somewhat?—A. Yes, sir; that is where you
                            find the whales.</p>
                        <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0054"/>
                        <p>Q. And if you see whales for two or three days running you are pretty
                            sure to see them right along; that is, there is some time during the
                            season when the whales strike on, and then when they are gone of course
                            they are gone?—A. Yes, sir; I consider August and September two very
                            valuable months there.</p>

                        <p>I, Thomas Scullun, of Chelsea, county of Suffolk and Commonwealth of
                            Massachusetts, on oath depose and say: My name is Thomas Scullun; I am
                            39 years of age; by occupation a master mariner. I was born in New
                            Bedford, Massachusetts, and am a native-born citizen of the United
                            States, and my domicile is in Chelsea, Massachusetts. I first went to
                            sea when I was 14 years of age as steerage boy, and have been at sea
                            ever since, going through all the grades to master.</p>
                        <p>I sailed on my first voyage as master in the fall of 1888 from San
                            Francisco in the bark <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> for a
                            whaling voyage. I made that voyage, returning to San Francisco in the
                            fall of 1889, refitted, and again sailed. I sailed each fall, returning
                            in the following fall, until the fall of 1891. On the 7th of December,
                            1891, I again sailed as master of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                                Pigeon</hi> from San Francisco on a whaling voyage to the Yellow
                            Sea, Japan Sea, and the Okhotsk Sea. I had a full crew, consisting of
                            thirty-four all told, four officers, four boat steerers, cooper,
                            steward, and two boys. These are all correctly stated upon the crew
                            list, and their lays are set forth correctly. The ship’s papers which I
                            had were the articles, register, health certificate, and the manifests.
                            I brought back all these papers to San Francisco when I returned there
                            this fall, 1892, and delivered them to the custom-house officer. They
                            are now in the custom-house at San Francisco. The vessel was fitted for
                            a whaling voyage, with the usual fittings for that purpose. She was in
                            no way fitted for a sealing voyage. She had no salt, no rifles, no
                            sealing boats, and no gunners. There was no intention, in fitting for
                            the voyage or at the time of sailing, of doing any business in sealing.
                            The log book is on board the ship, and before sailing I will give it to
                            Mr. Wing to be brought to New Bedford.</p>
                        <p>After leaving San Francisco we first went to Ascension, one of the
                            Caroline Islands, and then to Guam, one of the Ladrone Islands. From
                            there we went to the Yellow Sea, and cruised until about the 1st of
                            April. From there we went right to Vladivostok, arriving there about the
                            26th of April, to repair a slight leak. While I was there I tried to get
                            a permit to go to the Russian bays off the Okhotsk Sea whaling. We
                            telegraphed to St. Petersburg for a permit, for which I offered to make
                            compensation, but could not get a permit to go into the bays for
                            whaling. For the last five seasons I had whaled in the Okhotsk Sea. I
                            understood that we were not permitted to whale in the bays off the sea,
                            but the sea itself was open to us, and it was for the purpose of getting
                            permission to whale in the bays that I sought this permit. After we left
                            Vladivostok we cruised in the Japan Sea until the 26th of June, when we
                            returned to Vladivostok. We went there to recruit ship with fresh
                            provisions. We left Vladivostok the 6th of July and went to the Okhotsk
                            Sea, where I had <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0055"/>prosecuted the
                            whaling until I was taken, on the 10th of September. During this time I
                            had taken two whales, which yielded 2,600 lbs. of bone and 200 barrels
                            of oil. One of these whales was caught about 120 miles from Sagalien
                            Island and about 40 miles off Yetaup Island, and the other 150 miles
                            from Sagalien and 80 miles from Yetaup Island. The night of the 9th,
                            about 7 o’clock, we took in all sail and luffed to on the port tack,
                            with the foreyard back, and about a quarter of 3 a.m. the officer came
                            down and called me, and said there was a schooner coming down off the
                            weather quarter, and he thought it was the <hi rend="italic">Mary H.
                                Thomas</hi>. It was then dark and foggy. The <hi rend="italic">Mary
                                H. Thomas</hi> was a whaling schooner, which had been upon the
                            ground with us and which the log book will show we had spoken
                            previously. I went on deck and saw her coming down, and I saw that if
                            she kept coming as she was she would draw aft so that we would not see
                            the red light; so I told the officer of the deck to set a white light so
                            that he would see us, because I wanted to speak him at daylight to find
                            out the whaling news. What I mean by that is, whether he had taken any
                            whales or seen any whales. About a quarter of 4 the officer came down
                            again and said, “That is not the <hi rend="italic">Mary H. Thomas</hi>.
                            It is some other schooner, and he wants to speak us.” So I went on deck,
                            and as I got on deck they lowered a boat down from the schooner, and I
                            saw that the officer was some naval officer by the uniform. This boat
                            came alongside, and a young officer came on board and demanded my ship’s
                            papers. I asked him what right he had or what he wanted my ship’s papers
                            for. Said I, “I am no sealer, and we are not off Robin Island.” He said,
                            “What are you doing here?” and I said, “I am whaling here.” He said,
                            “Well, you have no right to whale here, and my captain wants you to come
                            aboard.” I saw he could not talk good English, and I said, “Can your
                            captain talk good English?” and he said, “Yes.” So I said, “All right,”
                            and took up my papers, and he picked up my charts in the cabin, and we
                            went aboard the schooner, and I saw then that she was a sealer, one of
                            the confiscated schooners. So I asked the captain of the schooner what
                            this all meant, and he said, “What are you doing here?” Said I, “I am
                            whaling; it is a whale ship.” He said, “Well, you have no right to whale
                            here in the Okhotsk Sea.” I said, “Why not?” And he says, “The Okhotsk
                            Sea is a closed sea.” Said I, “How long since?” “Why,” he says, “it has
                            always been a closed sea.” “Well,” said I, “that is funny. I have been
                            coming here the last five years whaling, and have been in Vladivostok
                            every year.” He says, “Well, we have always overlooked the whalers
                            before, but this year we have got orders to take all the whalers and all
                            the sealers we can find. I have orders from my admiral to take all the
                            whalers and all the sealers I can find.” And he said, “What did you set
                            that bright light for? “I said, “I saw you coming down and I thought you
                            were the <hi rend="italic">Mary H. Thomas</hi>, and I wanted to speak
                            the <hi rend="italic">Mary H. Thomas</hi>, so I set the bright light so
                            they could see me.” He says, “Well, I am going to take you to
                            Vladivostok.” I said, “All right, but I think you have no right to take
                            me.” “Well,” he says, “I am not sure myself whether I have a right to
                            take you, but I am going to take you to Vladivostok.” I said, “Well, my
                            whaling has just commenced here, and if you take me down to Vladivostok
                            you make me lose my season’s work, and if you do your Government will
                            have to pay for it.” “Well, if I am in the wrong my Government will pay
                            for it.”</p>
                        <p>Then he ordered me to stay aboard the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                                Pigeon</hi> and keep my steward and boy. He says, “Your officers and
                            crew come aboard and take charge of the schooner and myself and crew
                            will come aboard and take the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                            Pigeon.</hi>”</p>
                        <p>I said, “Where are you going to take my ship?” He said, “Down to
                            Vladivostok.” I said, “You have no right to put my officers and crew
                            aboard that schooner and tell them to go to Vladivostok, or anywhere
                            else. If you put my officers and crew aboard there they will go anywhere
                            they have a mind to. They may go to San Francisco or they may go to
                            Yokohama and sell her, and you can not stop them. The schooner has got
                            no papers.” “Well,” he says, “I am going to put them aboard and lam
                            going to order them to go to Vladivostok.” I said, “If you do you will
                            have to pay them for taking the schooner down, whether I am in the right
                            or in the wrong. You make them prisoners.” My first officer came to me
                            and wanted to know what he should do, whether to go to San Francisco or
                            to Vladivostok, and I told him to go to Vladivostok and they would pay
                            him for bringing the schooner down. My officers and crew told me that
                            after they went aboard they asked him what right he had to take the
                            ship, and he said he took her for whaling in the Okhotsk Sea; that the
                            Okhotsk Sea was a closed sea, and that we had no right to whale
                            there.</p>
                        <p>I went back on the <hi rend="italic">Pigeon</hi> with an officer and five
                            armed men, and they boarded the schooner, and then the crew of the
                            schooner, two officers and twelve men, came on board and took charge of
                            the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>. They navigated the <hi
                                rend="italic">Pigeon</hi> down, and I had nothing to do with the
                            ship on the voyage down to Vladivostok; but I was not restrained of my
                            personal liberty, and I occupied my own stateroom and <pb n="46"
                                xml:id="pg_46" facs="0056"/>had my meals with the officers. On the
                            way down I said one day, “I believe you have made a bad mistake; I
                            believe you had no right to take this ship.” He said, “If you hadn’t had
                            two whales on board I wouldn’t have taken you. I should have simply told
                            you that you had no right to whale in the Okhotsk Sea and ordered you
                            out. But as it is I have got to take you, because I should be afraid my
                            crew would blow on me when I arrived in port if I did not.” The schooner
                            got to Vladivostok three days before us, and when we arrived the
                            lieutenant told me to let my crew go aboard of their own ship and his
                            crew would go aboard of the schooner. So I told my first officer to get
                            the crew together and get them aboard and take charge. My crew were then
                            on the schooner. After I went ashore orders came to the schooner for the
                            crew to go ashore, and they were told that they were going to have
                            quarters at the station house. They were landed on the wharf, bag and
                            baggage, without food or shelter.</p>
                        <p>Nobody was there to receive them, and I found them about 8 o’clock in the
                            evening. I went up to the captain of the port to find out about it, and
                            he said that he gave orders to land the crew and take them up to the
                            station house, and there they would find quarters. So I told him that
                            they were landed there on the wharf and nobody there to receive them or
                            show them where the station house was. He said he could not do anything
                            that night, so I went and got them a place in a Chinaman’s
                            storehouse.</p>
                        <p>The next day the first officer and the second officer went to the station
                            house to find out about the quarters, and they were told they would let
                            them know to-morrow. The next day they went there with an interpreter,
                            and they were told that they had the names of the men, and that money
                            had been sent in for the men, but that the chief of police would not do
                            anything about the affair, and they said again they would let them know
                            to-morrow. So they went there every day until the admiral arrived and
                            the governor. When the admiral and the governor arrived the officers
                            went to the governor, and he put them aboard of their own ship. They
                            went to him about 11 o’clock in the forenoon, and about 5 o’clock in the
                            afternoon they were put aboard the bark. The exact day will be shown by
                            the log book.</p>
                        <p>While at Vladivostok I stayed at the hotel. I could get no information or
                            directions as to whom I was to apply for release of my ship, and was
                            informed that nothing could be done until the admiral and governor came.
                            When the governor arrived I made a protest to him, demanded monthly
                            wages from the time we were taken until we arrived in San Francisco, and
                            demanded my passage from Vladivostok to San Francisco for myself and
                            officers and crew. We supposed then that they would not restore the
                            ship. He told me as soon as he read it that he would straighten this
                            affair up as soon as they could.</p>
                        <p>The next day an officer came and took me on board the flagship, where I
                            was informed by the officer who took the ship they were to have a
                            hearing. I was not allowed in to the hearing, but was left on deck about
                            an hour. Then an officer came up to me and said, “Come, Captain, we will
                            go aboard of your bark.” I told him who I was, and he told me that he
                            was captain of the flagship. He said, “We are going aboard of your bark
                            to hold a declaration. I said, “I suppose you want my log book, don’t
                            you?” He said, “Yes; where is your log book?” I said, “I have got it
                            ashore.” He said that he wanted me to go and get it, and they manned a
                            boat and took me ashore. I got the log book and came back on board of
                            the flagship, and then the captain Of the flagship, five other captains,
                            a judge, and a lieutenant, and myself got in a steam launch and went
                            aboard of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, and there they
                            overlooked the log book, and could find nothing wrong in it. They went
                            down in the hold and searched for sealskins or salt, bored into the
                            casks to see if there were any skins or salt, but could find nothing to
                            show that I had been sealing or aiding sealers, and they drew up a
                            declaration in the Russian language to that effect.</p>
                        <p>I signed that document, and asked them for a copy of it in English, which
                            they gave me the next day with my log book. Then the next day I was sent
                            for again to come on board the flagship, and was told by the judge that
                            I could have my ship and be allowed to go to sea if I would bring no
                            claim against the Russian Government. And I said, “If I bring a claim
                            against the Russian Government, I cannot have my ship?” and the judge
                            said, “Well, yes, I guess so.” I said, “Well, lam going to bring a claim
                            against the Russian Government for loss of my season’s work and my
                            expenses here.” So the judge sent in word to the admiral that I was
                            going to enter a claim against them. The admiral sent word back to know
                            what my claim was going to be. I told them, and the admiral sent word
                            for me to send my claim in, and after I sent my claim in that no claims
                            from, me or my owners would be recognized afterwards. I asked for two
                            days to make out my claim, and I made it out and sent it in.</p>
                        <p>The next day after that I had orders to go to sea from the admiral. The
                            Government <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0057"/>steam launch took the
                            ship in tow and towed her down to the mouth of the harbor. I was not
                            ready to go to sea. The next day I got a letter for the admiral wanting
                            to know why I did not go to sea, and I told him that I was not ready;
                            that I had got to get provisions aboard, and it was bad weather. He
                            wanted to know if he could help me in any way; if I had money enough to
                            get my provisions with, and I wrote back and told him that I had. I
                            sailed on the 1st of October and arrived at San Francisco the 5th of
                            November.</p>
                        <p>I did not go back to the whaling grounds, because the season was
                            finished. The season for whaling in the Okhotsk closes from the 5th to
                            the 10th of October. It would have taken me at that time about ten to
                            fifteen days to have got back there, as the northerly winds had set in,
                            so that I could not possibly have got therein time to do any whaling.
                            The season in the Okhotsk closes when the heavy gales from the north
                            commence, about the 10th of October, and then we have to leave. The
                            season in the Okhotsk Sea is the months of August, September, and the
                            first part of October. Some seasons are longer than others, depending
                            upon the weather. At the time I left Vladivostok the stormy season had
                            set in this fall. The basis upon which my claim was made up was an
                            average of seven to eight whales. I took my log book and found that in
                            the four seasons I had taken 28 whales, and the average of that would be
                            7 whales to a season, and this season I had already taken 2 whales when
                            I was captured. The time I was taken was just when the great body of the
                            whales had made their appearance. We saw whales the day we were taken
                            and the next day. This was just the time when the whales came on this
                            ground. My accounts with the owners will show my expenses.</p>
                        <p>At no time during the voyage in question was the <hi rend="italic">Cape
                                Horn Pigeon</hi> or myself, either directly or indirectly, engaged
                            in sealing or aiding or assisting others engaged in sealing. Neither the
                                <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, myself, or my officers and
                            crew took any seals. We never had any intention of taking any seals,
                            either on the land or water. The ship was not provided with the tackle,
                            furniture, and material necessary therefor, nor for the preservation of
                            seal skins, and in no way was the ship or my officers and crew engaged
                            in any sealing enterprise. Neither I nor, to my knowledge, have any of
                            the officers or crew of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>
                            received any indemnity whatever, in any form, for the loss and damage
                            sustained by the seizure or any part thereof, with the following
                            exception: The day we got the vessel back I was called down in the
                            steerage by the cooper, and he showed me his chest, which had been
                            broken open by the Russian crew. The lieutenant was called down and
                            shown the chest, and he said he was sorry it was done, and for the
                            cooper to make out his bill and bring it to him and he would pay him;
                            that he did not want the admiral to know anything about it. The cooper
                            made out his bill of 39 rubles, and the lieutenant paid him out of his
                            own pocket.</p>
                        <p>I have left with Mr. Wing copy of a statement made by myself and officers
                            at Vladivostok on the 21st of September, 1892; also declaration of the
                            officers and crew of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> made at
                            Vladivostok on the 23d day of September, 1892; also copy of my letter to
                            the Russian admiral and my claim filed with him. I also refer to my
                            communications to Commander Charles N. Gridley, United States Navy,
                            commanding United States steamer <hi rend="italic">Marion</hi>, which
                            was at Vladivostok during this time, and which communications I
                            understand have been forwarded to the Department by Commander Gridley.
                            The amount of the claim when recovered will go into the proceeds of the
                            voyage, to be distributed like other proceeds of the voyage, in which
                            the officers and crew will each have his lay as if it had been the
                            proceeds of oil and bone taken. No objection has ever been made during
                            the five seasons that I have been in the Okhotsk Sea whaling until this
                            time to whaling there, and I had received no, notice or information of
                            any difference in the law from what it had been in the past seasons
                            until it was stated by the officer. I leave December 14 for San
                            Francisco, and shall probably sail from San Francisco as master of the
                                <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> upon another whaling cruise
                            on the 22d of December, and expect to return to San Francisco in
                            November, 1893, going to the same places where I have been for the last
                            five seasons.</p>

                            to the seizure of the brig <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, in
                            substitution of the claim made by Thomas Scullen, master of the said
                            brig, to the Russian admiral at Vladivostok on September 25, 1892.</p>
                        <p>You will observe that the statements of the memorial are fully
                            substantiated by affidavits; that the items of damage are the same as
                            those presented by Captain <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0060"
                            />Scullun to the Russian admiral, but which at the time of that
                            presentation were not sustained by affidavits as they now are.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> was at the time of seizure,
                            and still is, owned by American citizens.</p>
                        <p>She cleared from San Francisco December 7, 1891, for a whaling voyage,
                            and the seizure took place on September 10, 1892, in the Sea of Okhotsk
                            on the high seas, not within the jurisdiction of Russia.</p>
                        <p>The circumstances of the seizure are fully given in Captain Scullun’s
                            affidavit.</p>
                        <p>The brig having been detained practically over the whaling season, great
                            loss was occasioned thereby to the owners of the vessel aforesaid.</p>
                        <p>I would also call your excellency’s attention to the affidavits of Baker,
                            Cleveland, and Lapham, all masters of whaling vessels, with large
                            experience in the Okhotsk Sea, bearing on the above point and showing
                            the loss incurred by the detention.</p>
                        <p>The other items for which claims are made will also be found among the
                            inclosed papers.</p>
                        <p>It will also be seen that Captain Scullun, having informed the Russian
                            authorities at Vladivostok that he intended to prefer a claim for
                            damages, was requested by them to send in a claim, which he did, but the
                            next day he was ordered by the Russian admiral to go to sea, and was
                            towed to the mouth of the harbor by a Government tug.</p>
                        <p>An extract, in copy, from Captain Scullun’s log book, covering the period
                            from the 23d of September to the 1st of October, 1892, inclusive, is
                            herewith inclosed, and a copy also of the letter from Captain Scullun to
                            the Russian admiral at Vladivostok submitting his claim.</p>
                        <p>In presenting this claim I am instructed by my Government to express its
                            hope that an adequate indemnity will be allowed the claimants.</p>
                        <p>I avail myself of this occasion to return to your excellency the
                            assurance of my most distinguished consideration.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Chargé d’Affaires</hi>: The Imperial Ministry of
                            Foreign Affairs has had the honor to receive the letter you had the
                            goodness to address to it on September 27/October 9, of the current
                            year, requesting information regarding the matter of the seizure for
                            unlawful hunting in Russian waters, of the following-named American
                            vessels: The <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, arrested on
                            September 10, 1892; the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>,
                            August 2, 1891, and the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, July 15,
                            1892.</p>
                        <p>I hasten to communicate to you in my turn the following answer:</p>
                        <p>1. As regards the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, I believe I
                            must refer to the ministerial note of June 12, 1893, No. 2187, in which
                            was exposed the point of view of our marine ministry on the matter of
                            the request of indemnity presented by the captain of the American vessel
                            in question, and which amounted to $49,500. Putting aside first of all
                            from this total, as being absolutely exaggerated, the sum of $45,000,
                            representing, <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0061"/>according to the
                            statement of the claimant, the price of the whales which he could have
                            killed during the time of his detention, the Marine Ministry has,
                            moreover, raised objections against another point of the claim. It was
                            the one indicated under the title of minor expenses—charges for
                            telegraph, hire of the boats and cabs, and remuneration of the clerks.
                            The captain requesting an indemnity of $3,400 on this account; the
                            Marine Ministry found that sum much too high and required that the
                            claimant, if he considers that he has a right to it, should produce at
                            least vouchers confirming this part of the claim.</p>
                        <p>I must inform you, Mr. Chargé d’Affaires, that the documents transferred
                            by the legation of the United States in its subsequent note of June 2,
                            1894, do not offer the character of vouchers to the claim in question.
                            We find, indeed, in the Appendix No. 1 particularly a simple
                            reproduction of the primitive request of the captain with regard to
                            these $3,400, but without indorsing this request with any proof, nor
                            even specifying it in detail, which naturally deprives it of its value
                            from the legal point of view. Consequently, before it will be able to
                            decide in regard to the claim of the captain of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, it is reasonable to expect the production of
                            formal evidence, already claimed in the above-mentioned ministerial
                            note.</p>
                        <p>2. As to the case regarding the American schooner <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis</hi>, the Imperial Ministry of Marine, with which the
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not fail to enter into communication on
                            this subject, in consequence of the note of the United States Legation
                            of June 30/July 11, 1894, has made known that it has taken the necessary
                            measures to dispatch to St. Petersburg certain documents, which have
                            remained in Petropavlovsk, the examination of which was indispensable,
                            with a view to arriving at a decision. I have, however, renewed our
                            request to the Ministry of Marine in order to hasten the solution of
                            this case, and I shall not fail to inform you of the result of our
                            proceedings.</p>
                        <p>3. Regarding the case of the American schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                                White</hi>, the Ministry of Marine has sent us the communication,
                            the tenor of which is as follows, and which serves as an answer to the
                            allegations of the captain of the said vessel, reproduced in the note of
                            the legation of December 12/24, 1894:</p>
                        <p>The Ministry of Marine insists that the assertion of the captain that he
                            was captured at the point of intersection of 54° 18’ latitude north and
                            167° 15’ longitude west is found to be contradicted by the protocol of
                            the capture. Moreover, the captain acknowledged himself, in a memorandum
                            made in his own hand on the protocol, that it was at this last point
                            that he found himself on the day of the arrest. And what proves that the
                            captain understood what he signed and did not suffer in this respect any
                            pressure, is that he accompanied his signature with observations
                            relative to other points of the protocol—as, for example, to the point
                            in regard to the absence of signal lights on the schooner, which he did
                            not find correct. It results, therefore, according to the protocol, that
                            the vessel was arrested at a distance of 23 miles from the nearest
                            Russian coast, and not 80 miles, as is assured hereby by Captain
                            Furman.</p>
                        <p>The Ministry of Marine states, moreover, that at the moment of the arrest
                            the journal of the vessel was found not kept for two days, and the visit
                            discovered instruments for fishing seals, as well as five seals freshly
                            killed and not yet skinned.</p>
                        <p>As to the assertions of Captain Furman relative to the conditions under
                            which he arrived in our waters and sailed the previous days, they are
                            contradicted by the journal of the schooner, which shows that during the
                            fifteen days which preceded the capture the vessel remained in the
                            neighborhood of the Commodor Islands—as, for example, on the 18(30)
                            June—when Captain Furman pretends to have hunted at 40 miles from the
                            southern shores of Agatou Island, it is proved in reality that he was at
                            a distance of 11 miles from the isle of Medny (Copper).</p>
                        <p>Similarly with regard to the declarations of the captain, as well as of
                            the Pilot Ronning and Mr. Wolfgang, concerning the treatment that they
                            had undergone at the same time as the rest of the crew, the inquest
                            established that the treatment, far from giving place to complaints,
                            provoked, on the contrary, from the part of the several persons in
                            question, thanks addressed to the commander of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Zabiaca</hi>. At Petropavlovsk the crew in question, as well as the
                            others belonging to other captured vessels, were, in want of other
                            premises belonging to the State and to be disposed of in the town,
                            boarded in buildings dependent on the administration of the local
                            police, and each man received the alimentary allowance prescribed by the
                            law.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it has been established that the captain and the crew of the <hi
                                rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> were allowed to keep their own
                            clothes as they did not belong to the outfit of the schooner, and that
                            the return to their country on board the <hi rend="italic">Majestic</hi>
                            of the said crew, together with the others who were in the same case,
                            was executed by order of the commander of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Zabiaca.</hi></p>
                        <p>It follows from all these statements that the capture in question was
                            made under perfectly regular conditions.</p>

                            long been the frequent subject of voluminous correspondence between the
                            Imperial Government and this embassy in the attempt to reach a
                            settlement of the, damages incurred by the vessels and their
                            employees.</p>
                        <p>Actuated by an earnest desire to definitely settle these cases at an
                            early date, my Government has authorized me to offer, on behalf of the
                            various claimants, terms of settlement which would be accepted by it in
                            their behalf by way of compromise, and which I now have the honor to
                            submit in the hope that, recognizing the friendly spirit of the
                            proposition, the Imperial Government will respond by an acceptance of
                            the terms submitted and agree to thus dispose of these vexatious
                            questions.</p>
                        <p>It is, however, my duty to say that this offer of compromise is submitted
                            solely for the purpose of obtaining a prompt settlement of these claims,
                            and that, should the terms offered not be acceptable to the Imperial
                            Government, or in case a compromise is not effected, nothing herein is
                            to be considered as in any way prejudicing the rights of the claimants,
                            nor especially their rights to recover the full amounts of their claims
                            by arbitration or negotiation.</p>

                            dated January 27 (February 8), of the current year, on the subject of

                            honor to communicate to the Embassy of the United States in its notes of

                            its voyage in 1892, upon which it was seized. It sailed from San

                            the 5th of November, 1892.</p>

                        <p>8. What are the two papers I now hand you?—A. A chart of the North
                            Pacific Ocean covering the east coast of Asia from Bering Strait to the
                            Philippine Islands.</p>

                                rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> at the time it was seized?—A.
                            The vessel was seized in latitude 46° 30’ north, and longitude 146° 35’
                            east, as stated by Captain Scullun, and as appears in the log book. I
                            have marked upon the chart this position by a cross with my initials.
                            The place is about 90 miles distant from the nearest land in a
                            southeasterly direction, and about 125 miles from the nearest land in a
                            westerly direction.</p>
                        <p>10. How long have you been in the whaling business?—A. Nearly fifty
                            years, and as manager of whaling enterprises for about forty years.</p>
                        <p>11. How many whaling vessels have you had under your charge at one
                            time?—A. Fourteen or fifteen.</p>
                        <p>12. Has your experience covered all kinds and classes of whaling?—A. It
                            has.</p>
                        <p>13. And in all oceans?—A. Yes; except the Antarctic.</p>
                        <p>14. Has the management of this business been carried on by you
                            personally?—A. I have always personally managed it.</p>
                        <p>15. Will you please state, Mr. Wing, what, in your opinion, was the value
                            of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, with its outfits and
                            equipment, as it was at the time and place of seizure?—A. Upward of
                            140,000.</p>
                        <p>16. Will you please state how you arrive at this valuation?—A. I take the
                            value of the vessel and outfits as it was in January, 1890, at the time
                            when we rebuilt it completely from the water’s edge externally, and
                            internally below the water’s edge, making it perfect, at $10,000 before
                            the rebuilding. At that time we expended for the rebuilding and for the
                            outfit account, $23,064.54, as appears by the account current from our
                            books, a copy of which I hereto annex. Of this amount of $23,064.54, I
                            have taken $11,500 as the cost of the rebuilding, that is, of the
                            permanent addition to the vessel, leaving $11,564.54 as the outfit
                            account for that voyage. This makes a value of $21,500 of the vessel,
                            with the remains of its old outfit for its voyage of the season of 1890.
                            I then take the average outfit for this voyage and the three subsequent
                            voyages, as appear in the accounts taken from our books, and hereunto
                            annex the four outfit accounts, being marked “Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7.”
                            These four accounts show as follows: <table rows="5" cols="2">

                        <p rend="flushleft">being an average outfit of $10,810.54. This, added to
                            the $21,500, makes $32,210.54. To this must be added 8 per cent for one
                            season’s insurance, and interest for ten months, 5 per cent, making 13
                            per cent, or $4,200.37, to ascertain the actual cost value based upon
                            its original value, for which I am confident it could have been sold,
                            but which I would not have taken for it at the time we commenced the
                            rebuilding. To this should be added 12½ per cent for the increased value
                            arising from the consummation of the enterprise, the preparation and
                            outfitting of the vessel, the directing and management of the
                            enterprise, and the added value from the arrival of the vessel at the
                            place of service. This last item has always been taken into account in
                            all the cases of which I have had knowledge, such as the <hi
                                rend="italic">Alabama</hi> claims and the claims made before the
                            Chilean Commission, etc. This 12½ per cent would amount to $4,563.86,
                            which, added to the $36,510.91, gives a value of the vessel at the time
                            it was seized, as it then was, of $41,074.77. If on the date of its
                            seizure I had known its situation I certainly should not have taken
                            $40,000 for it.</p>
                        <p>17. Were you, in 1892, familiar with the price of oil and bone in the
                                market?—<pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0065"/>A. Thoroughly. It was
                            my business to keep run of it and know its condition, and I did so. I
                            had oil and bone on hand for sale.</p>
                        <p>18. What, in your judgment, was the fair market price for Northern whale
                            oil, such as the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> was taking, on
                            the date of the seizure of the vessel, the 10th September, 1892?—A. $13
                            a barrel.</p>
                        <p>19. Did this price vary during the fall and winter?—A. Very slightly, if
                            any. It was substantially something better than 40 cents a gallon, which
                            equals $13 a barrel, there being 31½ gallons to the barrel.</p>
                        <p>20. What, in your opinion, was the market value of the bone which the <hi
                                rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> was taking at the time of its
                            seizure?—A. During the month of August this bone was $5 a pound, sales
                            being made from $4.90 to $5.10 per pound. In the month of September
                            sales were made, the price in some cases not being quoted, but through
                            this month and the month of October the price fell to about $4.25. The
                            price declined during those two months to about $4.25, sales being made
                            at that figure, and in the month of November there was a further decline
                            to about $4.</p>
                        <p>21. In the ordinary course of business, if the <hi rend="italic">Cape
                                Horn Pigeon</hi> had not been seized when would her catch have
                            reached the market?—A. On her arrival at San Francisco, about the last
                            of October or the first of November, then her catch would have been
                            marketable.</p>
                        <p>22. In your experience is oil and bone ever sold to arrive?—A. Yes.</p>
                        <p>23. Would it have been possible for you to have sold in the market the
                            catch of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> subject to
                            arrival?—A. Yes; subject to the condition not to exceed a certain
                            quantity.</p>
                        <p>24. Would such a sale have commanded the going market price?—A.
                            Substantially.</p>
                        <p>25. Please examine the paper handed you and state what it is.—A. It is
                            the copy of the account with the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>
                            of expenses paid by us on account of the seizure and this claim to the
                            9th of January, 1899.</p>
                        <p>26. Have these sums actually been paid?—A. They have.</p>
                        <p>(Account annexed, marked “Exhibit 8, W. F. C”)</p>
                        <p>27. Since January, 1899, have you incurred any other expenses?—A. We
                            have. Probably $200 or $300, which have not been paid.</p>
                        <p>28. Are there any other outstanding liabilities on this account already
                            incurred?—A. There is an unsettled account for services and assistance
                            rendered to Captain Scullen at Vladivostok, which we have never settled,
                            awaiting the determination of the claim.</p>
                        <p>29. Do you know of any notice ever issued by the Russian Government in
                            relation to the closure of the Okhotsk and Bering seas to whalemen?—A. I
                            do not. I never heard of any such order. The only order or notice of
                            which I ever knew was a notice given to Captain Spencer, of the British
                            whaling bark <hi rend="italic">Fair away</hi>, the 1st of September,
                            1875, which was printed in the New Bedford Whalemen’s Shipping List of
                            the 7th of December, 1875, a copy of which I annex to this
                            deposition.</p>
                        <p>(Exhibit annexed, marked, “9, W. F. C.”)</p>
                        <p>30. Did Captain Scullun know of this notice?—A. He did.</p>
                        <p>31. What did this notice prohibit?—A. Whale fishery in the gulfs and bays
                            of Bering and Okhotsk seas within 3 miles of the coast and islands.</p>
                        <p>32. Was it in consequence of this notice that Captain Scullun, as he
                            says, sought to secure a license to carry on the whale fishery in the
                            gulfs and bays within 3 miles of the land?—A. It was.</p>

                            officer. Last night the crew was landed ashore from the schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">Marie</hi>, and left without food or shelter, and
                            finally was taken in by a Chinaman, who let them sleep in his
                            storehouse. Cabled the report of the seizure of the ship to owners at 4
                            p.m., and to the United States minister at St. Petersburg. Wrote to the
                            captain of the <hi rend="italic">Marion</hi> protesting against the
                            seizure of the ship, and asking his assistance and advice in the matter.
                            Was this day asked for my log book by the officer in charge of my ship.
                            He told me the admiral of the port wished to see it. The crew are still
                            with the Chinaman, who is feeding them. Sick man still in hospital. So
                            ends this day.</p>

                            found my log book on board and took charge of the same. The men are
                            complaining of want of food and proper shelter, but I can do nothing, as
                            they are in the hands of the Russian authorities, who do nothing for
                            them. Made out another protest in behalf of myself and officers and
                            crew, setting forth a full statement of the facts of the seizure, which
                            I took on board the <hi rend="italic">Marion</hi>. This was signed by
                            myself and officers and witnessed by T. A. Herber, surgeon, and W. M.
                            Crose, ensign, as the captain was not on board at this time. The captain
                            of the <hi rend="italic">Marion</hi> informed me that he could not act
                            in this matter, as it was now in the hands of the United States minister
                            to Russia, as I had cabled a report of the seizure to him. Waiting for
                            instructions from him and owners. So ends this day.</p>

                                    gulfs or bays, nor approach nearer than 3 miles to the coasts
                                    and islands belonging to us in the seas of Bering and Ochotsk,
                                    for the whale fishery in the gulfs, bays, and straits, and
                                    within a distance of three miles from the coasts and islands
                                    mentioned is granted exclusively to Russians.</item>
                                <item>“2. Foreigners can not land on our coasts or islands without
                                    the permission of the chief of the place, neither for supplies
                                    or wood nor to melt down the fat of whales. This permission
                                    should be obtained from the governor-general of the Primorskara
                                    Ablast at Vladivostock or Petropavlovski.</item>
                                <item>“3. Captains of foreign vessels are forbidden under any
                                    circumstances to leave their sailors in any uninhabited place
                                    within Russian territories as a punishment for breaches of
                                    discipline. For this purpose, and for repairs, for victualling,
                                    and for other necessaries, Petropavlovski, the port of
                                    Kamschatka, is open to foreign vessels. During their anchorage
                                    in that port they are forbidden to carry on the whale fishery,
                                    and they should submit themselves to and carry out all the
                                    regulations and laws of that port.”</item>

                        <p>Captain Spencer reports that the water was alive with whales, and he
                            urgently solicited the privilege of remaining twenty days, but the
                            commander of the war steamer replied that his orders were peremptory,
                            and he had no discretion in the matter—that licenses to whale in the
                            Ochotsk would be granted to foreign applicants for $250 at
                            Petropavlovski. Under the circumstances Captain Spencer had no
                            alternative other than to recall his boats, which had lowered for a
                            chase, and leave the ground.</p>

                        <p>We declare that we sailed from the port of San Francisco on December 7,
                            1891; bound on a whaling voyage, and that we cruised in the Yellow Sea
                            and Japan Sea until the beginning of July, when we called at the Russian
                            port of Vladivostock, in eastern Siberia, on our way to the Okotchk Sea,
                            for the purpose of laying in a stock of fresh provisions and to give
                            liberty to our crew.</p>
                        <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0096"/>
                        <p>Up to this time we had caught no whales, and while in port permission was
                            asked of the Russian authorities by Captain Scullun to enter the bays
                            along the Siberian coast to hunt for whales, but this permission was
                            refused.</p>
                        <p>We sailed from the port of Vladivostock on the 6th of July for the
                            Okotchk Sea, and on the 12th of August caught our first whale about 120
                            miles from Sagalien Island and about 40 miles off Yetarup Island. Our
                            second whale was taken on the 31st of August, the position of the ship
                            then being about 150 miles from Sagalien Island and about 80 miles off
                            Yetarup Island.</p>
                        <p>We further declare that about 4 a.m. on the morning of the 10th of the
                            present month, while cruising for whales in latitude 46° 30’ and
                            longitude 146° 35’, and being then about 126 miles from Sagalien Island
                            and Yetarup Island being about 84 miles distant, we were boarded by a
                            sealing schooner called the <hi rend="italic">Marie</hi>, which had been
                            confiscated by the Russian authorities, and was then manned by Russian
                            sailors and commanded by a Russian naval officer.</p>
                        <p>The said Russian naval officer came on board of our vessel and demanded
                            the ship’s papers from the captain, and informed him that he had seized
                            the ship for whaling in the Okotchk Sea, and that this was contrary to
                            the Russian law, as the Okotchk was a closed one. The captain protested
                            against the seizure of the ship, and told the officer that he had never
                            been informed that the Okotchk Sea was closed, nor had he ever been
                            warned not to enter it. No attention was paid to the protest, however,
                            and the said officer, with another officer and twelve armed Russian
                            sailors, there and then took possession the ship.</p>
                        <p>We furthermore declare that the said officer never asked to see the log
                            book, and that while in conversation with the captain he expressed
                            doubts as to his legal right to seize the ship, but said that he was
                            acting under instructions from his admiral, and that if any mistake was
                            made his Government would rectify it.</p>
                        <p>We further declare that the said officer then ordered all hands,
                            excepting the captain and the steward and a boy, to proceed on board of
                            the schooner <hi rend="italic">Marie</hi> and to take her to
                            Vladivostock.</p>
                        <p>We proceeded on board of the said schooner and brought her to
                            Vladivostock and arrived on the 15th instant. On the 18th instant the
                                <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> arrived in the harbor flying
                            the Russian naval flag. At about 5 p.m. a steam launch came alongside of
                            the <hi rend="italic">Marie</hi> and ordered us to take our effects and
                            get into her, and we were then landed on the beach without food or
                            shelter, and had it not been for a Chinaman, who took us in and allowed
                            us to sleep in a storehouse, we should have had to sleep in the
                            streets.</p>
                        <p>We were told when we landed from the schooner that quarters and food
                            would be supplied to us in the gaol, but although we have applied there
                            several times we can learn nothing.</p>
                        <p>We furthermore declare that we believe the seizure of the ship to be
                            unjust and illegal, as the vessel has not visited the bays, nor have we
                            fished inside the limit of 3 marine leagues, as the log book can
                            testify.</p>

                        <p>We, the undersigned, master, officers, and crew of the bark <hi
                                rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, of New Bedford, Massachusetts,
                            U. S. A., hereby declare and make statement as follows:</p>
                        <p>The said bark sailed from the port of San Francisco on the 7th of
                            December, 1891, on a cruise for whales, the ship being solely and
                            exclusively fitted for that purpose, <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83"
                                facs="0097"/>and all of us having agreed to go on shares in the oil
                            and bone caught during the cruise, which was to terminate at said port
                            this autumn.</p>
                        <p>Sailing across the Pacific Ocean, the ship cruised in the Yellow and
                            Japan Sea, and called at the port of Vladivostock in the beginning of
                            July for provisions and water. Leaving that port on the 6th July we
                            proceeded to the Okotchk Sea, passing the Laparouse Straits on the 13th
                            July, nearest land on Sagalien Island, Cape Crillon bearing N. by E. and
                            Cape Siretoko bearing due N., the former being 20 miles and the latter
                            cape 30 miles distant. Since that date until the date of our seizure we
                            cruised between latitudes 47° 34’ and 44° 47’, and distant from land 30
                            to 100 miles, catching two whales.</p>
                        <p>On the 10th day of September at 4 a.m., the ship lying-to under small
                            sails, and being then in latitude 46° 30’ and longitude 146° 35’, the
                            nearest part of Sagalien Island being 126 miles and Yetarup Island being
                            about 84 miles distant, a boat from a schooner came alongside, and a
                            Russian naval officer came on board and demanded the ship’s papers and
                            the captain’s presence on board of the schooner. The captain accompanied
                            the officer accordingly, and soon returned on board of our ship with two
                            Russian naval officers and armed Russian sailors, who then took
                            possession of the ship and sent all of us on board of the schooner with
                            the exception of the captain, steward, and a boy, ordering us to proceed
                            to Vladivostock, which we did, arriving there on September 15th.</p>
                        <p>We were left on board of the schooner lying in the harbor until the
                            arrival of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, on the 18th
                            instant, with our captain on board. On the evening of that date we were
                            taken on shore and landed on the beach without food and shelter.</p>
                        <p>The above statement we declare to be true, and are ready at any time to
                            confirm the same by oath before any authority or court.</p>
                        <p>We further declare the seizure of our ship to be illegal, believing it to
                            be an act not sanctioned by international law, and, in our opinion,
                            unwarranted and unjustified, and we therefore believe that we are
                            entitled to compensation and indemnity, which we hereby declare that we
                            shall demand from the Government concerned.</p>

                            20th instant, having heard that the seizure of my ship was made on
                            suspicion of my having aided vessels engaged in sealing in the Okotchk
                            Sea, I beg to state again that the Russian officer (Lieutenant Coule)
                            who seized my ship stated distinctly at the time of seizure that I was
                            taken for whaling in the Okotchk Sea, and my officers and crew declare
                            that he specially stated and declared the same to them when they were
                            transferred to the schooner <hi rend="italic">Marie</hi> from my
                            ship.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, I declare that on the passage down to this port he again
                            explicitly stated that he made the seizure on account of whaling in the
                            Okotchk, and said that if I had not had two whales on board he would
                            have released me and simply warned me to leave the sea.</p>

                        <p>I have the honor to address you with reference to the illegal seizure of
                            the American bark <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, of New
                            Bedford, by the Russian authorities.</p>
                        <p>I sailed from San Francisco in command of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                                Pigeon</hi> on the 7th of December last on a whaling voyage, and
                            cruised in the Yellow Sea and Japan Sea until the beginning of July,
                            when I visited this port on my way north to the Okotchk Sea, and applied
                            to the authorities here for permission to enter the bays along the coast
                            of Siberia to hunt for whales; but this was refused.</p>
                        <p>I then proceeded on my way to the Okotchk Sea, and up to the time of my
                            seizure had taken two whales. On the 10th of this month, while cruising
                            for whales in latitude 46° 30’ and longitude 146° 35’, and being then
                            126 miles from Sagalien Island, and Yeterup Island being 84 miles
                            distant, we were boarded by a boat from a sealing schooner called the
                                <hi rend="italic">Marie</hi>, which had been confiscated by the
                            Russian authorities, and was then manned by Russian sailors and
                            commanded by a Russian naval officer.</p>
                        <p>The said officer came on board and demanded my papers, and then informed
                            me that he had seized the ship for whaling in the Okotchk Sea, and that
                            the same was contrary to the Russian law, as this was a closed sea.</p>
                        <p>I protested against the seizure of my ship, and told the officer that I
                            had never heard of the Okotchk being a closed sea. No attention was paid
                            to my protest, however, and said officer and his armed crew then took
                            possession of my ship, and ordered my officers and crew to go on board
                            of the schooner and to take her to Vladivost ck, which they did,
                            arriving here on the 15th instant.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday evening they were ordered on shore, and left without food or
                            shelter. Some of the men’s effects are still on board, but they are not
                            allowed to go and get them.</p>
                        <p>I have been on board of the Russian man-o’-war and to the various
                            officials on shore, but can get no satisfaction or information from any
                            of them.</p>
                        <p>My log book is in the possession of the authorities, or I should submit
                            it to you for examination.</p>
                        <p>I submit that the seizure of my vessel was illegal and unjustified and
                            without precedent. I have visited the Okotchk Sea five consecutive
                            seasons, but have never heard of any objection before, nor have I ever
                            been warned not to go, although I have visited this port four different
                            times.</p>
                        <p>I have always been careful not to infringe the Russian law in any
                            respect, and have carefully abstained from entering the bays or whaling
                            within the 5-mile limit.</p>
                        <p>As there are no United States consular authorities at this port, I must
                            request your assistance and advice in this matter, and would ask you to
                            address the proper authorities with a view to having some decision
                            arrived at as speedily as possible.</p>
                        <p>I have this day cabled a report of my seizure to the United States
                            minister at St. Petersburg, a copy of which I inclose.</p>
                        <p>I remain, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            referring to the note which General Clay, envoy extraordinary and
                            minister plenipotentiary of the United States of America, had the
                            goodness to address to the chancellor of the Empire, dated March 4 (16)
                            last, has the honor to inform him that he has just been put in
                            possession of information which, according to the desire of the Federal
                            Government, the Imperial cabinet had hastened to request from the
                            ministry of marine, concerning the incident which occurred in the Sea of
                            Okhotsk between an American whaler and a vessel of the Imperial
                            navy.</p>
                        <p>Here is what appears from this information:</p>
                        <p>The schooner <hi rend="italic">Aleoute</hi>, under the command of
                            Lieutenant Etoline, had been sent on a mission from Nicolaievsk to Oudsk
                            to revictual that country. He was obliged by the great quantity of
                            floating ice to enter the Gulf of Tougoursk; there he encountered on
                            July 14, at about 20 miles south of the Strait of Chantarsk, near the
                            eastern coast, the American whaler <hi rend="italic">Java</hi> occupied
                            in melting the fat of a whale which it had just captured. Considering
                            that, according to the laws in force, foreign whalers are interdicted
                            from fishing in the Russian bays and gulfs at a distance less than 3
                            miles from shore, where the right of fishing is reserved exclusively to
                            Russian subjects, Lieutenant Etoline requested the captain of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Java</hi> to leave the Gulf of Tougoursk, which he
                            thereupon did.</p>
                        <p>The same day the <hi rend="italic">Aleoute</hi> set sail for the Bay of
                            Mangou, where she arrived the day following the American whaler <hi
                                rend="italic">Caroline Foot</hi>, the captain of which, accompanied
                            by the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Java</hi>, presented himself
                            before Lieutenant Etoline and declared that he had no right to interdict
                            his fishing for whales wherever he thought fit. Lieutenant Etoline
                            replied that there were established rules in regard to the matter, and
                            that if they insisted on infringing them he would find himself obliged
                            to prevent them from so doing.</p>
                        <p>The captain of the schooner <hi rend="italic">Caroline Foot</hi> having
                            stated that he came into the Gulf of Tougoursk on account of injuries,
                            Lieutenant Etoline offered him every assistance in his power, and on his
                            request delivered him 7 poods of biscuits from the stores of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleoute</hi>, after which the two vessels went to
                            sea.</p>
                        <p>The 19th of July, that is to say, four days after, the schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleoute</hi> encountered a whale, at which the
                            commander fired a practice shot. At this moment he perceived at about 16
                            miles distance an unknown sail and a little after three boats, of which
                            the nearest was at least 3 miles away, in the direction in which the
                            shot had been fired. That night all these disappeared.</p>
                        <p>This incident is entered in the log book of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aleoute</hi> in the following terms:</p>
                        <p>“July 19, at 9 o’clock at night, at anchor in the Bay of Mongou; fired a
                            trial shot at a whale.”</p>
                        <p>From these data General Clay may easily convince himself that the
                            incident in question must have been greatly exaggerated and perverted to
                            make it to be represented as a grievance on the part of the American
                            whaler in regard to the commander of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Aleoute.</hi></p>
                        <p>Following the statements exchanged between them of the pretention of
                            right on the part of the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Java</hi> to
                            fish wherever he found it convenient and of the necessity under which
                            Lieutenant Etoline found himself to remind him of the existence of laws
                            governing the right of fishing in the territorial waters of a foreign
                            State, it is possible that the commander of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Java</hi> may have in fact taken as a menace directed against him
                            the practice shot fired from the <hi rend="italic">Aleoute.</hi></p>
                        <p>But it is incontestable that the commander of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aleoute</hi> was within his rights when he reminded the American
                            captains of the laws in force and of the obligation he was under to
                            cause them to be respected. He certainly did not pass the limits of his
                            right in firing, four days after, a cannon shot at a whale floating in
                            Russian waters. He had not the least intention of giving to the American
                            whalers useless <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0102"/>notice, since
                            they went away without difficulty, and the distance which separated the
                                <hi rend="italic">Aleoue</hi> from the vessel and boats at that
                            moment in sight excluded all such idea.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant Etoline proceeded in regard to them conformably to the good
                            relations between the two countries, since he offered his assistance in
                            repairing their injuries and provided them with supplies. Finally the
                            commander of the <hi rend="italic">Aleoute</hi> did not believe it his
                            duty to inform the Russian authorities of this incident, since it seemed
                            to him insignificant, and since for his part his conscience was clear
                            that he had not passed the limits of his rights nor failed in his
                            duties.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned flatters himself with the hope that the Federal
                            Government, being informed of these details, will consider the incident
                            closed.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile he seizes the occasion to renew to General Clay the assurance
                            of his most distinguished considerations.</p>

                                >Vostok</hi> in the Sea of Okhotsk in 1875. The screw propeller
                            schooner <hi rend="italic">Vostok</hi> left June 4, 1875, from
                            Vladivostok for the purpose of cruising along the shores of the Sea of

                            fishery. The cruise of this schooner was to guarantee the fisheries of
                            our whaling ships from the vast gulfs of the Sea of Okhotsk with the
                            engagement not to fish within 3 miles distance from our shores. At the

                            providing for the settlement of claims presented by Great Britain
                            against the United States in virtue of the convention of February 29,
                            1892. I transmit herewith, for greater convenience, a copy of the
                            convention of February 8, 1896, Article I of which reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>“The high contracting parties agree that all claims on account of
                            injuries sustained by persons in whose behalf Great Britain is entitled
                            to claim compensation from the United States, and arising by virtue of
                            the treaty aforesaid, the award and the findings of the said tribunal of
                            arbitration, as also the additional claims specified in the fifth
                            paragraph of the preamble hereto, shall be referred to two
                            commissioners, one of whom shall be appointed by the President of the
                            United States and the other by Her Britannic Majesty, and each of whom
                            shall be learned in the law. Appended to this convention is a list of
                            the claims intended to be referred.”</p>
                        <p>In virtue of this provision the President appointed the Hon. William L.
                            Putnam, of Maine, the commissioner of the United States.</p>
                        <p>After determining where the meetings of the commission shall take place
                            (see Article II), the convention (Article III) provides as follows:</p>
                        <p>“The said commissioners shall determine the liability of the United
                            States, if any, in respect of each claim, and assess the amount of
                            compensation, if any, to be paid on account thereof—so far as they shall
                            be able to agree thereon—and their decision shall be accepted by the two
                            Governments as final.</p>
                        <p>“They shall be authorized to hear and examine, on oath or affirmation,
                            which each of said commissioners is hereby empowered to administer or
                            receive, every question of fact not found by the tribunal of
                            arbitration, and to receive all suitable authentic testimony concerning
                            the same; and the Government of the United States shall have the right
                            to raise the question of its liability before the commissioners in any
                            case where it shall be proved that the vessel was wholly or in part the
                            actual property of a citizen of the United States.</p>
                        <p>“The said commission, when sitting at San Francisco or Victoria, shall
                            have and exercise all such powers for the procurement or enforcement of
                            testimony as may hereafter be provided by appropriate legislation.”</p>
                        <p>It also provides in Article V that in the cases, if any, in which the
                            commissioners shall fail to agree, they shall transmit to each
                            Government a joint report stating in detail the points on which they
                            differ and the grounds on which their opinions have been formed; and any
                            such difference shall be referred for final adjustment to an umpire, “to

                        <p>With this brief explanatory statement, I now transmit a copy of the
                            report or award of the commissioners, Mr. Putnam, and Mr. George E.
                            King, the commissioner appointed by Her Britannic Majesty. It is dated
                            December 17, 1897.</p>

                            the same thing with reference to the personal claims. It reads as

                        <p>It will be perceived that the commissioners say in their report, under
                            the head of personal claims:</p>
                        <p>“Her Majesty also presented for our consideration the following claims,
                            that is to say: In behalf of the <hi rend="italic">Black Diamond</hi>,
                            warned by the collector at Unalaska, on July 1, 1886, and also on behalf
                            of James Gaudin, master of the <hi rend="italic">Ada</hi>, as to each of
                            which we determine and award that we have no jurisdiction, and we
                            dismiss the same.”</p>
                        <p>Subsequently the commissioners recommend in regard to these two claims as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“Respecting the claims mentioned in the award of the commissioners as
                            having been presented on behalf of Great Britain and dismissed as not
                            being within our jurisdiction, namely, the claims of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Black Diamond</hi>, arising in the year 1886, and the
                            personal claim of James Gaudin, the commissioners, in pursuance of the
                            communication to them from the Secretary of State for the United States
                            and Her Britannic Majesty’s ambassador at Washington, dated at
                            Washington, January 26, 1897, and appearing in the protocol of February
                            2, 1897, beg to report as follows:</p>
                        <p>“We find that damages were sustained by the owners, master, officers, and
                            crew of the <hi rend="italic">Black Diamond</hi> in connection with the
                            notice given by the collector of customs at Unalaska on July 1, 1886, to
                            the amount of $5,000, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum
                            from September 10, A. D. 1887.</p>
                        <p>“And as to the personal claims of James Gaudin, master of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Ada</hi> in 1887, we report that the amount of damages
                            sustained by him was $1,000, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per
                            annum from September 10, 1887.”</p>
                        <p>A copy of the communication of the then Secretary of State and the
                            British ambassador, referred to by the commissioners, is appended
                            hereto.</p>
                        <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0105"/>
                        <p>I am of opinion that the amount of damages assessed by the commissioners
                            respecting the last-named claims should be included in the sum
                            appropriated by Congress to satisfy the award under the convention of
                            February 8, 1896. This Government would then be enabled to reach an
                            agreement with that of Great Britain for the final discharge of the
                            claims in question.</p>
                        <p>The amount to satisfy the claims of the <hi rend="italic">Black
                                Diamond</hi> is as follows: $8,080.83 being the principal, $5,000
                            and interest, $3,080.83, at 6 per cent per annum from September 10,
                            1887, to December 17, 1897. The amount to liquidate the personal claim
                            of James Gaudin, master of the <hi rend="italic">Ada</hi>, is as
                            follows: $1,616.16 being principal, $1,000, and interest, $616.16, at
                            the rate of 6 per cent per annum from September 10, 1887, to December
                            17, 1897.</p>
                        <p>Including these claims, the total sum necessary to be appropriated to
                            satisfy the award would be $473,151.26.</p>
                        <p>Should you coincide with my views, I respectfully recommend that this
                            report and a copy of the award of the commissioners be promptly laid
                            before Congress, with an urgent request for early and favorable
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>Upon this subject Article VIII of the convention of 1896 says:</p>
                        <p>“The amount awarded to Great Britain under this convention on account of
                            any claimant shall be paid by the Government of the United States to the
                            Government of Her Britannic Majesty within six months after the amount
                            thereof shall have been finally ascertained.”</p>
                        <p>Respectfully submitted.</p>

                            at the city of Washington on the 8th day of February, 1896, which

                            urged by it, did, by Article VIII of the said treaty, agree that either
                            party might submit to the arbitrators any questions of fact involved in
                            said claims, and ask for a finding thereon, the question of the

                            certain findings of fact which were agreed to as proved by the agent of
                            the United States, and the arbitrators did unanimously find the facts so
                            set forth to be true, as appears by the award of the tribunal rendered
                            on the 15th day of August, 1893;</p>
                        <p>And whereas in view of the said findings of fact and of the decision of

                            made, for any injuries for which, in the contemplation of the treaty

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Chargé d’ Affaires</hi>: In continuation of the
                            exchange of communications which has taken place between us on the
                            subject of a notification published by our consul at Yokohama relative
                            to fishing, hunting, and commerce in the Russian waters of the Pacific,
                            and in reply to the note which you have had the goodness to address me,
                            dated March 15/27, I am now in a position to give you the following
                            information:</p>
                        <p>A notification of the tenor of that annexed to your note of March 15 was
                            in fact published by our consul at Yokohama, and our consul-general at
                            San Francisco is also authorized to publish it.</p>
                        <p>This measure related only to prohibited industries and contraband trade;
                            the restrictions which it makes known extend absolutely to the
                            territorial waters of Russia. It was necessitated by the many abuses
                            reported during these last years which fell heavily upon the population
                            of our coasts and islands, whose sole means of existence is hunting and
                            fishing; the abuses are equally prejudicial to the interests of the
                            company to which the Imperial Government has conceded the monopoly of
                            the exploitation of the Commodore and Seal islands.</p>
                        <p>Outside of the new regulation, the essential point of which is the
                            obligation imposed upon captains of vessels who wish to fish and hunt in
                            the Russian waters of the <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0113"

                            from the Government of Eastern Siberia, the right of fishing, hunting,
                            and trading by foreigners in our territorial waters is regulated by
                            Articles 560, et sequitur, of Heading XIII, part 2, of the code of
                            laws.</p>
                        <p>In informing you of the foregoing I have the honor, Mr. Chargé
                            d’Affaires, to reiterate to you the assurance of my most distinguished
                            consideration.</p>

                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was an American schooner,

                        port of San Francisco, in the State of California. She was owned, officered,
                        and manned by citizens of the United States of America.</p>
                    <p>She sailed from San Francisco on the 7th day of March, 1891, with her
                        clearance and ship’s papers in proper and lawful form, with a full
                        complement of officers and men, destined for a cruise in the North Pacific
                        Ocean on a hunting and fishing expedition, with Alexander McLean as master,
                        Joseph McDonald as mate, 1 second mate, 1 cook, 1 cabin boy, 6 hunters, and
                        14 able-bodied seamen, well and sufficiently manned, victualed, and
                        furnished with all things necessary for a vessel in the merchant service,
                        and particularly for the voyage she was about to undertake.</p>
                    <p>In support of these allegations the following documents are hereto annexed
                        and submitted in evidence, marked respectively as herein stated: <list>

                        </list></p>
                    <p>Proceeding on her voyage, she arrived at Sand Point, Alaska, on June 27,
                        1891, where she came to anchor and took in fresh water and supplies. On the
                        following day she proceeded on her voyage.</p>
                    <p>On July 4, 1891, she reached latitude 52° 10′ north, longitude 165° west;
                        July 9, latitude 50° 10′ north, longitude 170° west; July 13, latitude 51°
                        10′ north, longitude 170° east; July 20, latitude 51° 35′ north, longitude

                        July 28, latitude 50° 20′ north, longitude 170° 20′ east: July 30, latitude
                        52° 40′ north, longitude 169° 20′ east; July 31, latitude 53° 10′ north,
                        longitude 169° east; August 1, latitude 54° north, longitude 168° 10′ east;
                        August 2, latitude 55° 35′ north, longitude 169° 21′ east, where she was
                        seized early in the morning of that day by the Russian cruiser <hi
                            rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, the said <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                            Lewis</hi> being at the time of the seizure about 20 miles distant from
                        and to the east of Copper Island, the nearest land.</p>
                    <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0118"/>
                    <p>The position of the schooner on the day of the seizure is stated in the log
                        book or journal of the said vessel, which is hereto annexed, marked “Exhibit
                        D,” and the same is attested by her crew. By the record contained in the
                        said log book the course of the schooner can be traced during her whole
                        voyage, which is graphically illustrated in the plotting of the course of
                        the vessel, according to the data given in said log book, upon the sailing
                        chart hereto annexed, marked “Exhibit E.”</p>
                    <p>An examination of these documents shows that the <hi rend="italic">James
                            Hamilton Lewis</hi> never in the course of this voyage entered Russian
                        territorial waters.</p>
                    <p>A statement upon the last page of the log book shows where she had killed all
                        the seals she had taken during the voyage, and it shows, further, that none
                        of the seals taken by her had been caught within Russian jurisdiction. All
                        had been taken on the high seas and had been shot with shotguns, as is the
                        common practice in so-called pelagic sealing or sealing upon the high seas.
                        The greater part of the seals taken by the vessel were females, as is shown
                        by the depositions of Thomas F. Morgan and John Malowansky, submitted before
                        the Paris tribunal of arbitration under the treaty between the United States
                        and Great Britain, concluded at Washington February 29, 1892, and published
                        in the official account of the proceedings by the Government of the United
                        States. A copy of the said official publication of the said proceedings,
                        Volume III, Appendix II to the case of the United States, is hereto appended
                        and submitted in evidence, marked “Exhibit F,” reference upon the point in
                        question being made on page 65, lines 14 to 20, and page 197, lines 38 to
                        42.</p>
                    <p>There were also among the catch of the vessel some young seals or pups, which
                        had been taken from the bellies of their dead mothers. The skins from these
                        young seals or pups form a separate article of commerce in sealskin market,
                        as is shown on page 503, lines 5 to 8, of Exhibit F.</p>
                    <p>On August 2, 1891, having on board 424 sealskins, the captain of the <hi
                            rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> deemed it necessary to make land
                        in order to test his chronometer, and he accordingly headed for Copper
                        Island.</p>
                    <p>Having approached sufficiently near to land for his purpose, he put his
                        vessel about, intending to make for waters more favorable to the pursuit of
                        the vessel’s calling, outside the Bering Sea in the Pacific Ocean and in the
                        track of the seals leaving the seal islands for their feeding grounds, and
                        also on his way homeward. Upon coming about, however, he was brought to by a
                        shot from the Russian cruiser <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>. Supposing that
                        the commander of the Russian vessel desired to speak with him, the captain
                        of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> hoisted the American flag
                        to indicate his nationality and that of his vessel, as is customary, and
                        came to, awaiting the arrival of a boat from the Russian cruiser.</p>
                    <p>On the arrival of the boat a Russian naval officer came on board the schooner
                        and demanded the official log book of the vessel, which was given him by
                        Captain McLean, as well as all other documents necessary to establish the
                        nationality and identity of the vessel. Every facility was given to the
                        Russian officer in his examination of the vessel, the captain having nothing
                        to conceal, but apparently his search was not conducted with great
                        thoroughness, for he failed to find 424 sealskins, which were on board and
                        easily discoverable.</p>
                    <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0119"/>
                    <p>The officer having made the examination, left the <hi rend="italic">James
                            Hamilton Lewis</hi>, taking with him the official log book of the
                        vessel, which he refused to give up.</p>
                    <p>Soon afterwards the officer returned with an armed crew and ordered Captain
                        McLean to leave his vessel and go on board the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>
                        as a prisoner, with all his ship’s company except seven. This command the
                        captain, well knowing that he had violated no law within Russian
                        jurisdiction and that he was subject to no orders from Russian officials,
                        refused to obey, and he thereupon put his vessel on her course, steering
                        east.</p>
                    <p>Upon this the commander of the Russian cruiser commenced a pursuit, and,
                        overhauling the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, by force of
                        arms and by violence captured her, overpowering the crew and making them and
                        the captain prisoners.</p>
                    <p>Captain McLean was taken as a prisoner on board the Russian cruiser and there
                        informed that his vessel was confiscated, and he thereupon entered a protest
                        against the seizure, a copy of which protest is to be found duly entered in
                        his log book or journal of the voyage.</p>
                    <p>In this protest Captain McLean stated that his vessel was illegally seized
                        and without right upon the high seas and not within 20 miles of land; that
                        neither the captain nor any member of the ship’s company had touched land
                        since they left Sand Point, Alaska, on June 28, 1891; that all seals on
                        board had been taken on the high seas and killed with shotguns; that the
                        skins of the two pups were taken from animals unborn which had been found in
                        the bellies of their mothers, and that no seals had been taken within forty
                        hours previous to the seizure.</p>
                    <p>At the time of the seizure and thereafter the captain of the <hi
                            rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was compelled under duress to
                        sign papers in the Russian language, of the contents of which he could have
                        no knowledge, not understanding Russian.</p>
                    <p>On August 3, 1891, the schooner and her crew were taken to Bering Islands,
                        and from thence to Petropavlovsk, and from thence to Vladivostock, all in
                        the Russian dominions. The vessel with her cargo and equipment and the
                        personal property of the crew was confiscated, and her captain, officers,
                        and crew held as prisoners and subjected to indignity and harsh treatment
                        and the crew put to hard labor. They were miserably lodged in an unwholesome
                        and vermin-infested building and inadequately fed, and in consequence of
                        this treatment they all suffered permanent injury to their health, became
                        emaciated in form, depressed in spirit, and undermined in constitution, and
                        finally two of them contracted smallpox, from which disease one of them
                        died.</p>
                    <p>All the facts regarding the said seizure are duly set forth in the documents
                        attached to the note of the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary
                        of the United States of America at St. Petersburg to the Imperial Russian

                                pretention of control thereof. Those portions of the sea which are
                                connected with the ocean are admitted to be free and accessible to
                                all the world even when they are surrounded by the possessions of a
                                single State. Certain restrictions of this principle admitted in
                                practice can only be justified by the necessity of safeguarding the

                            <p>Consequently, from the present point of view, the sovereignty of a

                                which would deprive them of their character of open seas. Thus
                                Sweden was in the wrong in claiming sole possession of the Baltic.
                                This sea communicating with the ocean, as it does, ought always to

                    <p>The sworn statement of the captain and several of the officers and crew of
                        the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, as well as the log book of
                        the vessel, show that all the seals taken by her during the voyage in
                        question were taken on the high seas. This evidence is supported by a study
                        of the habits of seals in the Bering Sea as set forth in the’ portions of
                        the appendix to the case of the United States in the arbitration before the
                        Paris tribunal upon the Bering Sea questions relating to the habits <pb
                            n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0124"/>of the seals, the character of
                        skins taken from seals caught in pelagic sealing, and the testimony of
                        Thomas Morgan on page 65 and of John Malowansky on page 97 of the volume. It
                        is to be noted in regard to the testimony of these deponents before the
                        Paris tribunal, that one was the agent of the lessees of the Pribilof
                        Islands, belonging to the United States, and the other the lessees of the
                        Commander Islands, belonging to Russia, and that the testimony of each is in
                        accord that a very large preponderance of the skins of the seals taken by
                        the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> were those of females. Now,
                        the whole tenor of the evidence presented to the Paris tribunal on the
                        subject of the habits of seals is to the effect that the male seals seldom
                        leave the islands, while the female seals frequently go to great distances
                        in search of food; and these distances extend to 30, 40, and even 200 miles
                        from land. The evidence regarding the character of the seals taken in
                        pelagic sealing is that from 70 to 95 per cent of those taken on the high
                        seas are females. Finally, the evidence of Mr. Morgan and of Mr. Malowansky
                        shows that from 80 to 95 per cent of the seal skins seized on the <hi
                            rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> by the Russian cruiser <hi
                            rend="italic">Aleut</hi> in 1891 were those of female seals. Thus,
                        therefore, the catch of this vessel was preeminently a pelagic one—that is
                        to say, caught on the high seas.</p>
                    <p>The deposition of Herman Liebes, presented to the Paris tribunal in the case
                        of the United States, and printed on pages 512 to 514 of volume 3 of the
                        publication of the United States Government of the proceedings, shows that
                        this deponent had offered special inducements to the pelagic hunters to
                        bring in male skins, but that each and all of the men approached on the
                        subject stated that it was impossible to obtain male seals in any quantity
                        on the high seas. It is clear, therefore, that it was to the interest of the
                        captain of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> to obtain male
                        seals. This, however, he could only do by taking them on or near the
                        islands. Had he been hunting near the islands he would certainly have taken
                        pains to secure male seals, as he could easily have done. Why should he run
                        all the risks incident to hunting in forbidden waters for what he could
                        procure as well or better in safety oh the open sea? That he did not procure
                        male seals, but on the contrary had an unusually large percentage of female
                        skins in his catch is of itself proof, therefore, that he was not fishing
                        near land, and this is substantiated by the evidence of the log book.</p>
                    <p>It has been claimed by the Russian Government that the skins of two “pups,”
                        or young seals, found on board the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                            Lewis</hi> could only have been taken on land.</p>
                    <p>The testimony submitted by the United States before the Paris tribunal shows
                        incontestibly that young seals are very frequently taken from the bellies of
                        their mothers, and not unfrequently alive. See the following pages of the

                        at the time of her capture, namely, that the animals had been taken out of
                        the bellies of their mothers, is entirely reasonable and in accord with the
                        well known facts in regard to sealing on the high seas, that young seals are

                        in his report that she was not more than 6 miles from Copper Island when
                        first seen and at a distance which he has variously given as 11 and 12 miles
                        therefrom when overhauled. The statement of the captain of the <hi

                        20 miles from Copper Island, the nearest land.</p>
                    <p>In default of evidence to show that she was nearer than 6 miles from Russian
                        land when seen, it must be accepted that she was not and that she was

                    <p>In the memorandum of the Russian ministry of marine, communicated to the
                        embassy of the United States in the note of the ministry of foreign affairs,
                        dated October 19, 1898, the claim is set up that the <hi rend="italic">James
                            Hamilton Lewis</hi> was about 5 miles from land when sighted, and that
                        she was seized at 11 miles from land instead of 12, as first stated by
                        Captain Brandt of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>. It is to be noted that
                        this memorandum was sent in reply to the note of the embassy of July
                        23–August 4, 1898, in which the physical impossibility of the <hi
                            rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> having been 3 miles from land
                        when sighted and 12 miles therefrom when overhauled is set forth. It is to
                        be noted that these changes exactly fill the physical conditions marked out
                        as possible in the embassy’s note, namely, giving the sailing vessel thirty
                        minutes, which is the speed mentioned in the embassy’s note as having been
                        attained by a racing yacht; but it must be borne in mind that this is not a
                        speed attainable by fishing and sealing schooners. The speed mentioned is
                        that attained under favorable conditions by a racing yacht with her bottom
                        freshly cleaned for the purpose. The Encyclopedia Britannica, in its article
                        on yachting, states that the yacht <hi rend="italic">Enchantress</hi> made
                        50 miles in four hours eighteen minutes in 1895. This was then the fastest
                        recorded time for an English yacht, and it is at the rate of a mile in five
                        and five-eighths minutes; and Exhibit R shows the recorded performances of
                        some of the fastest racing yachts in the world, and the best of these
                        demonstrates a rate of speed of four and seven-tenths minutes per mile,
                        while the best time made in the celebrated race between the <hi
                            rend="italic">Vigilant</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Valkyrie</hi> was
                        six and eight-tenths minutes to the mile. It is wholly without the range of
                        probability that the sealing schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                            Lewis</hi> was able to make a mile in anything like that time. If her
                        speed is put at a mile in eight or even nine minutes, it will be much more
                        within the probabilities. This, even allowing her to have gone about within
                        five minutes from the time when she was first sighted, which seems hardly
                        credible, and conceding the point as to her having been only 11 miles from
                        land when overhauled, would make her more than 6⅔ miles from Copper Island
                        when sighted by the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The arguments presented by the imperial ministry of marine, in the memorandum
                        above referred to, can hardly be accepted as sound international law. In
                        section 1 the assertion is made that the presence in Russian waters of a
                        vessel presumed to be engaged in illicit hunting justifies her pursuit into
                        nonjurisdictional waters and her arrest there. This is exactly parallel with
                        the principle of the British “Hovering act,” in regard to which Phillimore
                        says: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                municipal law can be lawfully made beyond the limits of territorial
                                waters, though in these hovering cases judgments have been given in

                                not have been sustained if the foreign state whose subjects’

                                The great improvements recently effected in artillery seem to make
                                desirable that this distance should be increased, but it must be so
                                by the general consent of nations or by specified treaty with

                    <p>This high opinion seems to cover the whole argument contained in this portion
                        of the memorandum except the attempt to apply the principle of an
                        international agreement made subsequently to the seizure of the property of
                        the citizens of a foreign State in its justification. This of course can not
                        for a moment be admitted. No law can be retroactive in its force. The
                        agreement between the United States and Russia for the protection of the
                        seal fisheries forms no basis for justification of the seizure and
                        confiscation of a vessel engaged in a pursuit which was previous to this
                        agreement, however unfortunate from an economical point of view, perfectly
                        legitimate at the time.</p>
                    <p>The second section of the memorandum is devoted to a justification of the
                        suspicion that the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> had been or
                        intended to be poaching within Russian jurisdiction. The allegations set
                        forth to justify these suspicions are as follows: Going about on being
                        perceived; persistent refusal to permit a search; incorrect information as
                        to the object of his course and as to the composition of his crew; haste to
                        set to rights what was inside the vessel; fact of concealing 424 skins the
                        results of hunting; presence on board of utensils used in hunting fur seals,
                        as well as two skins of young seals which could only have been killed on
                        shore; refusal to produce the authentic documents of the vessel; vague
                        declarations as to previous hunt on the high seas, etc. Not one of these
                        allegations is basis for a suspicion of guilt, nor is the whole assemblage
                        of them.</p>
                    <p>“<hi rend="italic">Going about on being perceived</hi>”—The vessel having
                        approached sufficiently near to the coast to answer the captain’s purpose,
                        and, according to the Russian statement itself, as near as was wise in view
                        of territorial limits, he put about. That at about that time the <hi
                            rend="italic">Aleut</hi> started in pursuit is a mere coincidence.</p>
                    <p>“<hi rend="italic">Persistent refusal to permit a search.</hi>”—There has
                        been no evidence to show any such. On the contrary, all the testimony on
                        both sides indicates that the captain brought his vessel to at once on being
                        signaled to do so, and that he gave every assistance in facilitating a
                        search. It may, however, be questioned by what right the commander of the
                            <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> proceeded to make a search under the
                        conditions existing, and whether the captain of the <hi rend="italic">James
                            Hamilton Lewis</hi> would not have been justified in refusing to permit
                        a search of his vessel. As to the purpose of his cruise and the composition
                        of his crew, they were matters subject perhaps to the municipal laws of the
                        United States, but not of Russia. One is at a loss to understand what is
                        meant by “haste to set things to rights within the vessel.” There has been a
                        statement that something was thrown overboard from the vessel, but what, no
                        one has undertaken to say, and the fact is denied by the captain and
                        crew.</p>
                    <p>“<hi rend="italic">Pact of concealing 424 skins</hi>.”—There is no evidence
                        of this, and it is submitted that it would not be easy to conceal such a
                        mass of salted skins. It seems more probable that there was no very close
                        scrutiny during the first search.</p>
                    <p>“<hi rend="italic">Presence on board of utensils used in hunting
                        seals.</hi>”—This is true. The avowed object of the cruise of the <hi
                            rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was the <pb n="112"
                            xml:id="pg_112" facs="0128"/>hunting of seals and for this purpose she
                        was fully equipped. But she was equipped for hunting seals on the high seas,
                        not on land, and the list of utensils specified as being found upon her are
                        just those used in pelagic sealing; namely, shot guns and bamboo spears for
                        taking wounded seals. There is, however, no mention of weapons for killing
                        seals on land; this is done with clubs, not guns. The presence of the skins
                        of two young seals has already been fully accounted for, reasonably and
                        conclusively.</p>
                    <p>“<hi rend="italic">Refusal to produce the authentic documents of the
                            vessel.</hi>”—The captain did produce, and at once, all that could be
                        required of him on the high seas, namely, the evidence of his nationality
                        and identity.</p>
                    <p>The remainder of the memorandum is taken up with an attempt to refute the
                        evidence of the log book. The claim that it is invalid as evidence, because
                        it was not submitted to the ministry of marine until six years and ten
                        months after the seizure, can not be admitted in refutation. Had a court of
                        admiralty been held upon the seizure the log book would have been produced
                        in that court. That such a court was not held is no fault of the claimants’,
                        whose agent, the captain, repeatedly demanded one. The confiscation of a
                        foreign vessel by administrative process, especially when seized upon the
                        high seas, is not in accordance with international rights, and the
                        concurrence of various ministries of the Russian Government in regard to the
                        sale of the vessel in no sense takes the place of a prize court.</p>
                    <p>The memorandum concludes with the startling statement that “admitting the
                        authenticity of the log-book it does not invalidate the incontestable facts
                        on which was based the decision taken by the Russian maritime authorities.”
                        That is to say, that direct evidence proving an alibi does not refute mere
                        suspicions of guilt unsupported by a single piece of affirmative
                        evidence.</p>
                    <p>Russia’s claim to a jurisdiction of 5 miles over its marginal waters can not
                        be accepted in justification of the seizure. Were the <hi rend="italic"
                            >James Hamilton Lewis</hi> first seen at any distance between 3 and 5
                        miles from Russian land this claim of jurisdiction would not be applicable
                        to the case, for Russia has never by any proclamation or other act given
                        notice to the world of any such claim to marine jurisdiction in the Bering
                        Sea. On the contrary, as shown by the publication of the ministry of marine
                        for 1875, p. 91, submitted in the evidence, the Russian Government sent out
                        a vessel in that year to warn foreign fishing and whaling vessels not to
                        practice their calling within 3 miles of Russian territory.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> would, therefore, have been
                        justified in taking seals at 6 miles from Copper Island. But in point of
                        fact she was not, nor had she taken any seals for forty hours before the
                        seizure.</p>
                    <p>And even had the vessel in question been within Russian territorial waters
                        when seen, the purpose for which she had approached Russian land was one,
                        for which she could not be interdicted the use of such waters. She had come
                        in toward land for the purpose of verifying her observations before starting
                        on her homeward voyage. The right of innocent passage by fishing and
                        merchant vessels in territorial waters is incontestable.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>In all cases in which territorial waters are so placed that a passage

                            connecting unappropriated waters, they are subject to the right of

                            nations, which was seen to be wanting to the alleged right of the
                            navigation of rivers, may fairly be said to have been given to that of
                            the sea. Even the earlier and more uncompromising advocates of the right
                            of appropriation reserved a general right of innocent navigation; for
                            more than two hundred and fifty years no European territorial marine
                            waters, which could be used as a thoroughfare, or into which vessels
                            could accidentally stray or be driven, have been closed to commercial
                            navigation; and during the present century no such waters have been
                            closed in any part of the civilized world. The right must, therefore, be
                            considered to be established in the most complete manner. (Hall.

                    <p>The Russian Government has, in the memorandum of the ministry of marine,
                        which accompanied the note of the ministry of foreign affairs to the
                        legation of the United States at St. Petersburg, dated May 18–30, 1896,
                        attempted to justify the seizure of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                            Lewis</hi> on the ground that being a sealing vessel her captain
                        resisting arrest and not having exhibited a log book showing the position of
                        the vessel from day to day but on the other hand giving a statement of the
                        occupation in which the vessel was engaged incompatible with the facts as
                        revealed, and of her having been put about when the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Aleut</hi> made for her, she had been in all probability engaged in
                        hunting seals within Russian territory. This is a chain of circumstances in
                        no wise incriminating the vessel, her master, or crew.</p>
                    <p>As a matter of fact, the evidence of the commander of the Russian cruiser
                        itself shows that upon the usual signal the master of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >James Hamilton Lewis</hi> brought his vessel to and hoisted the
                        American flag, and that upon the arrival of an officer from the Russian
                        cruiser to make a visit and search, he exhibited such documents as clearly
                        indicated the nationality and identity of his vessel. If the right of visit
                        and search upon a fishing vessel in time of peace upon the high seas be
                        conceded, it must on the other hand be admitted that that right had been
                        fully complied with by the exhibition of the papers in question showing the
                        vessel to be sailing under the flag of a friendly State and in no way
                        connected with piracy or any other act cognizable by the Russian Government.
                        Had the Russian Government been in a position to produce any direct evidence
                        of any depredation in Russian waters, or to show any corpus delicti, that
                        any seals were taken in Russian waters by this or some unknown vessel, then
                        there might have been ground for a continuation of the search, and by
                        investigation either connecting the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                            Lewis</hi> with such depredation or establishing her innocence.</p>
                    <p>The captain was perfectly aware of his entire innocence of wrong, and, while
                        being a peaceable man, he was willing to waive any dispute as to the right
                        of search on the part of a Russian war ship upon the high sea. He therefore
                        exhibited such documents as served to show his nationality and identity,
                        including his official log book. He did not deem it necessary to exhibit his
                        private log book, showing the position of his vessel from day to day. This
                        he was the less disposed to do upon seeing his official log book promptly
                        confiscated. His private log book was the evidence on which he might prove,
                        in case of the confiscation of his vessel, that she had not been within
                        Russian territorial waters. It is to be noted, in order to remove the
                        suspicion which the Russian officials have raised, that upon the first visit
                        and search he had exhibited the official log book and other documents to
                        prove his nationality, justly deeming these all the necessities of the case
                        could require. This official log book the Russians had refused to <pb
                            n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0130"/>return to him, and it was therefore
                        natural that upon finding his vessel seized and confiscated he should
                        jealously guard the proofs of his innocence of wrong. That the log book
                        exhibited was an entirely valid one for the purposes for which it was
                        intended by the laws of his country the Revised Statutes of the United
                        States show, and it is to be noted that entries of the position of the
                        vessel are not required by law to be made in this book, nor is it customary
                        to make them therein.</p>
                    <p>Chapter VII, on Navigation, of the Revised Statutes of the United States

                    <p>Having complied with all that the law of nations could under the
                        circumstances require of him as regards any right of search Russia may have
                        possessed, the captain did not deem it incumbent on him to accept any
                        orders, to consider himself under arrest, or to go on board the Russian
                        cruiser and give himself up. He simply continued his voyage until he was
                        compelled by force of arms to submit to the arrest and confiscation. The
                        Russian Government has claimed that his failure to surrender his ship was an
                        act of resistance. He made no resistance; he had submitted to search, and he
                        knew that nothing <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0131"/>incriminating had
                        been found, and as in duty bound to his owners he continued his voyage until
                        compelled by force to submit to arrest.</p>
                    <p>The evidence adduced by the Russian Government simply shows that this vessel
                        came into the neighborhood of Copper Island, where, by Russian
                        acknowledgment, she had a perfect right to come, and that she had taken a
                        number of seals, which, so far as Russia is concerned, she had a right to
                        take provided they were not taken in Russian jurisdiction, and that the
                        master evinced a disposition to escape arrest and to evade inquiries. There
                        was no evasion of search, and the evasion of inquiry is only circumstantial
                        evidence of guilt, when an obligation to submit to investigation and to
                        answer questions truly is first established. If the master of the <hi
                            rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was overhauled and submitted to
                        interrogation, which the interrogator had no lawful authority to make, his
                        reticence and his indisposition to make a full disclosure can not be given
                        the construction put upon them by the Russian Government. It is to be borne
                        in mind that the master denies these allegations; but, supposing them to be
                        true, they do not even tend to connect the master with any unlawful act in
                        Russian jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>There is not a particle of affirmative evidence in support of the contention
                        that the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> or her crew ever
                        entered Russian waters, and every evidential fact alleged against her by
                        Russia is entirely consistent with the lawful pursuit of her calling upon
                        the high seas.</p>
                    <p>Russia has taken an American vessel upon the high seas at least 12 miles from
                        any Russian territory and confiscated her and her equipment. She has
                        arrested and imprisoned the master and crew of this vessel, and after they
                        were released left them to make their way home penniless as best they
                        might.</p>
                    <p>Such an act could only be justified upon proof of infraction of Russian law.
                        The Russian Government has furnished no evidence whatever of any such
                        infraction. It has simply shown what has never been denied, that the <hi
                            rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was engaged in sealing in the
                        waters of the North Pacific Ocean, but there is no evidence to show that the
                        seals taken by her were captured where Russia had the right to control the
                        seal fishing. On the contrary, all the evidence goes to show that the vessel
                        was hunting seals on the high seas far from any land.</p>
                    <p>The Russian Government has seen fit to throw doubt on the authenticity of the
                        log book of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, herewith
                        submitted in the evidence, on the ground that it was only produced long
                        after the seizure. It is to be borne in mind that the master of the vessel
                        repeatedly asked for a trial while in Vladivostok, but that this was denied
                        him and, as the Russian Government has itself admitted, the vessel was
                        confiscated with her equipment and cargo on the administrative process. This
                        it is contended is in contravention of the rights of the owners under the
                        principles of international law. They were entitled to have their rights
                        submitted to a court of admiralty. Had the Russian authorities seen fit to
                        grant to the master a trial the log book would have been produced in court,
                        It was the property of the master, and his duty to his owners to whom he was
                        responsible forbade his risking its confiscation under the summary process
                        adopted in taking his vessel by presenting it to his captors. Since the
                        presentation of the case to the Imperial Russian Government through the <pb
                            n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0132"/>medium of the diplomatic channels
                        of the United States the log book has been at the disposition of the
                        Imperial Government at any time and, indeed, as the correspondence shows,
                        the document has been repeatedly offered to the Russian Government for its
                        inspection. The delay in its presentation is therefore due to the Russian
                        Government itself, and such delay can in no wise be brought up as evidence
                        of a fictitious character as regards this piece of evidence.</p>
                    <p>Similarly the testimony of the master and crew as to their treatment during
                        the period of their detention has been thrown aside by the Russian
                        Government, stating that they are mere assertions unsupported by proofs, and
                        that if the members of the crew suffered ill treatment they should have
                        complained at Vladivostock.</p>
                    <p>In view of the summary proceedings in confiscating the vessel, the ignoring
                        of their protest against its seizure, and the persistent refusal of a trial,
                        it is not easy to see what these men had reason to believe that they would
                        gain by making any complaint to the Russian officials. It would be an easy
                        method of disposing of testimony unfavorable to the case of a litigant to
                        throw it aside as fictitious. All of this testimony, including the log book,
                        is submitted under oath and must be accepted as valid until disproved.</p>
                    <p>As regards the authenticity of the log book, it bears upon its face every
                        evidence of genuineness. The several entries are all made seriatim without
                        hiatus, ending with a copy of the protest of the master and the statement of
                        the crew, which is signed by every surviving member thereof. As the crew
                        separated after leaving Vladivostok, and as their signatures are all made
                        with the same ink, it is unreasonable to suppose that they did not sign at
                        the time of the seizure or during detention at Vladivostok.</p>
                    <p>But even if the evidence of the log book be rejected the fact still remains
                        that the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was seized wholly
                        without Russian jurisdiction and without a scintilla of proof that she had
                        ever been within it. She was not even within 6 miles of Russian land when
                        sighted and was coming toward it; therefore she could not have been nearer
                        to it within the knowledge of the Russian officials; though had she been she
                        had the right of innocent passage therein.</p>
                    <p>No evidence of depredation within Russian territory or territorial waters on
                        the part of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> or anyone
                        belonging to her or by anyone else has been shown.</p>
                    <p>She had certain seal skins upon, her which, sailing upon the high seas, she
                        had a right to have. No attempt has been made to prove that they were the
                        skins of seals taken in Russian waters, or even that they were skins of
                        seals of the Russian herd, although this could have been easily established
                        by the experts in the fur-seal business had it been so.</p>
                    <p>The vessel was arrested upon the merest suspicion, which has not only been
                        proven to have been justifiable, but which the evidence herein submitted
                        proves to have been wholly unfounded.</p>

                    <p>The third item, that for loss of catch, is one for absolutely direct damages
                        arising out of seizure. In the case of the United States vessel <hi
                            rend="italic">Betsey</hi>, unlawfully detained by British authorities,
                        the majority of the board of arbitration decided in favor of allowing to the
                        claimant, not only the value of the vessel and her cargo, but also the
                        profits which would have been derived from the sale of her cargo had she
                        been allowed to continue her voyage. The claims of the owners of the <hi
                            rend="italic">Neptune</hi> were similarly decided in 1795.</p>
                    <p>In the case of the American brig <hi rend="italic">Williams</hi>, seized by
                        the Mexican Government in 1829, the umpire awarded passage money which would
                        have been received if the brig had been permitted to continue her voyage to
                        her immediate destination, where she expected to receive a cargo of
                        passengers.</p>
                    <p>The damages claimed for loss of catch of a sealing vessel are in no sense a
                        claim for indirect damages or for speculative profits. In the present case
                        they represent the direct loss sustained by the owners, officers, and crew
                        of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, owing to her arrest and
                        confiscation while in pursuit of her lawful calling upon the high seas. They
                        are such damages as are usually allowed in analogous cases for losses
                        suffered, as measured by the value of the services of the vessel, her
                        outfit, and crew.</p>
                    <p>The rule of damages is well settled that in a fishing voyage the loss of the
                        services of a fishing vessel is to be compensated upon the value of the
                        vessel’s use during the voyage interrupted. It is the measure of damage
                        suffered by the parties in interest from the deprivation of the use of their
                        property. It is the same rule of damages as that applied in the case of the
                        seizure of a whaling ship. In the case of the <hi rend="italic">Costa Rica
                            Packet</hi>, the distinguished arbitrator admitted the principle of the
                        loss of catch of a whaling vessel as the measure of damage owing to the
                        detention of the vessel.</p>
                    <p>In the case of the <hi rend="italic">Hope On</hi>, detained by the Chilean
                        Government in in 1883 at Talcahuano, the commission of arbitration in
                        rendering its award, said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The principle is well established in cases like the present, that the
                                loss of the use of the vessel is the proper measure of damages, and
                                the loss of such use is the loss of her probable catch, during her
                                enforced absence from the fishing grounds. (G. B. Borden <hi

                    <p>The Bering Sea Commission, in its awards in cases analogous to the present,
                        clearly adopted this rule in measuring the damages sustained by sealing
                        vessels owing to seizure.</p>
                    <p>The loss of the vessel itself is not the only direct injury sustained by
                        these claimants owing to the confiscation of their vessel. The loss of <pb
                            n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0134"/>the use and service of their
                        schooner and her outfit during the season for the purpose for which she was
                        equipped is also to be taken into consideration. This is an injury sustained
                        not alone by the owners, but by the officers and crew as well, who were
                        thereby deprived of the means of earning their living. No one has the right
                        to deprive another of the means of gaining his sustenance in any lawful
                        calling which he may see fit to engage in. Equally, no one has the right by
                        a summary act to divert the earning capacity of the invested capital of
                        another. If the laborer is worthy of his hire, so also is invested capital
                        entitled to its legitimate profit.</p>
                    <p>The damages sustained by these claimants can not be measured by the value of
                        their vessel and its outfit alone. They had not done wrong to Russia and
                        they were entitled to go peaceably on their way, employing their vessel and
                        their own services in the lawful calling in which they were engaged. When
                        the Russian Government, or its agents, took on itself to deprive them of
                        this right it became responsible for all the consequences of its act. To
                        restore to these parties, at the present time, their vessel or its valve
                        would not be at all to put them back in the position in which they stood at
                        the time of the seizure. Neither would the addition of interest on such
                        payment compensate the parties for their loss. The owners had not embarked
                        their capital in a hazardous undertaking upon the ocean to gain simply such
                        interest as their money might earn at home by its investment in securities.
                        In every well-regulated business undertaking in which capital is involved,
                        the interest upon the capital is deducted from the gross proceeds before
                        profits are declared. As it is now impossible to put the parties back where
                        they were at the time of the seizure, the only just basis of compensation
                        for the injuries sustained by them owing to the seizure is upon a fair
                        estimate of the probable catch added to the value of the vessel and its
                        outfit, together with interest upon the whole. As upon a sealing voyage, the
                        crew are compensated by lay in lieu of wages, such a basis discharges the
                        indemnity due both to them and to the owners.</p>

                        the United States, Mr. Justice Gray, in delivering the opinion of the court,
                        said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Both the questions of law presented by the record relate to the

                                rules of law governing this question are well settled, and the only
                                difficulty is in applying them to the peculiar facts of the
                                case.</p>
                            <p>In order to make full compensation and indemnity for what has been

                                while laid up for repairs. When there is a market price for such use
                                the price is the test of the sum to be recovered. When there is no
                                market price, evidence of the profits that she would have earned if
                                not disabled is competent. (United States Reports, vol. 105, pp.

                        Supreme Court of the United States, Mr. Justice Nelson, in delivering the
                        opinion of the court, said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>As to the question of damages, the jury were instructed, if they
                                found for the plaintiffs, to give damages that would remunerate them
                                for the loss necessarily incurred in raising the boat and repairing
                                her, and also for the use of the boat during the time necessary to
                                make the repairs and fit her for business.</p>
                            <p>By the use of the boat, we understand what she would produce to the
                                plaintiffs by the hiring or chartering of her to run upon the river
                                in the business in which she had been usually engaged.</p>
                            <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0135"/>
                            <p>The general rule in regulating damages in cases of collision is to
                                allow the injured party an indemnity to the extent of the loss
                                sustained. This rule is obvious enough, but there is a good deal of
                                difficulty in stating the grounds upon which to arrive in all cases
                                at the proper measure of that indemnity.</p>
                            <p>The expenses of raising the boat and of repairs may of course be
                                readily ascertained, and in respect to repairs no deduction is to be
                                made, as in insurance cases, for the new materials in place of the
                                old. The difficulty lies in estimating the damage sustained by the
                                loss of service while she is undergoing the repairs.</p>
                            <p>That an allowance short of some compensation for this loss would fail
                                to be an indemnity for the injury is apparent. This question was
                                directly before the court of admiralty in England, in the case of
                                the <hi rend="italic">Gazelle</hi>, decided by Dr. Lushington, in
                                1844, 2 W. Robinson, 279. That was a case of collision, and in
                                deciding it the court observed “that the party who had suffered the
                                injury is clearly entitled to an adequate compensation for any loss
                                he may sustain for the detention of the vessel during the period
                                which is necessary for the completion of the repairs and furnishing
                                the new articles.</p>
                            <p>In fixing the amount of the damages to be paid for the detention the
                                court allowed the gross freight, deducting so much as would, in
                                ordinary cases, be disbursed on account of the ship’s expenses in
                                earning it.</p>
                            <p>This rule may afford a very fair indemnity in cases where the repairs
                                are completed within the period usually occupied in the vovage in
                                which the freight is to be earned. But if a longer period is
                                required it obviously falls short of an adequate allowance. It looks
                                to the capacity of the vessel to earn freight for the benefit of the
                                owner and consequent loss while deprived of her service. In other
                                words, to the amount she would earn him on hire.</p>

                        An examination of the awards made in certain cases before the Bering Sea
                        Commission leaves no room for doubt that, in <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120"
                            facs="0136"/>those cases at least, the commission adopted the rule as
                        contended for by the English Government and as herein stated. In the awards
                        upon all these claims it is perfectly clear that the loss of catch was
                        allowed in measuring the damages. If there were any doubt of this, it is
                        relieved by such cases as No. 14, the <hi rend="italic">Triumph</hi>, where
                        the sole claim was for loss of catch. In the case of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Triumph</hi>, No. 14, not No. 11 for the same vessel, the award was
                        $15,500, the original claim was for $19,674, of which $250 was for legal and
                        other expenses, $19,424 being for balance of estimated catch of 2,500 skins
                        at $8 each. It was admitted that the <hi rend="italic">Triumph</hi> had
                        transshipped part of her season’s catch before entering Bering Sea on or
                        about July 4, a considerable part of the season had already elapsed and it
                        was reasonable to suppose that she had taken a fifth part of her probable
                        catch before entering Bering Sea, thus 2,000 skins would remain to be taken
                        to make up the season’s work of 2,500 skins. She had on board 72 skins when
                        taken, leaving 1,928 skins to be taken to make up 2,000. One thousand nine
                        hundred and twenty-eight skins at $8 would amount to $15,424, and the award
                        was for $15,450, as has been said.</p>

                        <p>Thomas F. Morgan, being duly sworn, says: I am 44 years of age, and
                            reside in the town of Groton, Conn. In 1868 I shipped as second mate of
                            the bark <hi rend="italic">Peru</hi>, owned by the firm of Williams
                            &amp; Haven, of the city of New London, Conn., which vessel was
                            commanded by my father, Capt. Ebenezer Morgan, and sailed on that bark
                            from Honolulu about the 27th day of February, 1868, for the purpose of
                            catching seals on the islands in Bering Sea, Williams &amp; Haven having
                            for many years been engaged in seal fisheries, and being; so far as I
                            know, the largest firm in the United States engaged in that business. We
                            sailed to the port of Sitka and there applied to the commander, Gen.
                            Jefferson C. Davis, for permission to land the cargo of the bark on the
                            Pribilof Islands, and take seals on those islands. At the end of the
                            season I remained on the island of St. Paul, one of the said Pribilof
                            Islands, until August, <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0142"/>1869, as
                            a representative of Williams &amp; Haven’s interests in and about the
                            said island. In the last-mentioned year I returned to this country, and
                            at the request of the Alaska Commercial Company, of which Williams &amp;
                            Haven were stockholders, I was employed in the year 1874 to return to
                            the Pribilof Islands as a representative of the said Alaska Commercial
                            Company.</p>
                        <p>In pursuance of such request I returned to the islands as agent of said
                            last mentioned company in charge of the island of St. George, which,
                            with the islands of St. Paul, Otter, and Walrus, constitute the group
                            known as the Pribilof Islands, I arrived at said island some time in
                            May, 1874; took up my residence there, and remained in my capacity of
                            agent in and about that island during each sealing season thereafter
                            until the year 1887. At the expiration of the sealing season of 1887 I
                            returned to the United States, and in 1891 was engaged by the Russian
                            Sealskin Company, of St. Petersburg, as chief agent of that company, to
                            proceed to the islands of Komandorski, consisting of Copper and Bering
                            islands, commonly called the Commander Islands, which said company had a
                            lease of the said Commander Islands as well as of the island of Tuleni
                            or Robben, in the Okhotsk Sea, to kill seals and other fur-bearing
                            animals on those islands on the payment of a royalty to the Russian
                            Government. During the years above mentioned I have superintended the
                            killing of, on the average, 18,000 seals a year, and in the last year of
                            my employment by the Russian Sealskin Company I killed or superintended
                            the killing of 30,000 seals. The skinning, curing of skins, packing of
                            skins, and shipping of the skins from the islands of all the seals the
                            killing of which I superintended has been under my immediate
                            supervision, and a considerable part of the work thereof has been done
                            by me personally.</p>
                        <p>That during my employment on said Pribilof Islands I carefully studied
                            the habits of the fur seal and the statements hereafter made as to the
                            habits of said animals are based on my own observation, and also from
                            the fact that these statements have been corroborated by natives and
                            residents on said islands whom I know to be familiar with every phase of
                            seal life.</p>
                        <p>The Alaska fur seal breeds, I am thoroughly convinced, only upon the
                            Pribilof Islands; that I have been on the Alaska coast and also along
                            the Aleutian Islands; that at no point have I ever observed seals to
                            haul out on land except at the Pribilof Islands, nor have I been able to
                            obtain any authentic information which causes me to believe such is the
                            case.</p>
                        <p>The Alaska fur seal is migratory, leaving the Pribilof Islands in the
                            early winter, going southward into the Pacific and returning again in
                            May, June, and July to said islands. I have observed certain bull seals
                            return year after year to the same place on the rookeries, and I have
                            been informed by natives that have lived on the islands that this is a
                            well-known fact and has been observed by them so often that they stated
                            it as an absolute fact.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the cause the seals chose these islands for their home is
                            because of the isolation of these Pribilof Islands and because the
                            climatic condition of said Pribilof Islands is particularly favorable to
                            seal life. During the time the seals are upon land the weather is damp
                            and cool, the islands being almost continually enveloped in fogs, the
                            average temperature being about 41° F. during the summer.</p>
                        <p>The pup seals are born on the breeding rookeries on St. Paul and St.
                            George islands during the months of June and July. When first born a pup
                            can only live upon land, is not amphibious, and is unable to swim. If it
                            is washed off into the sea by the surf it is drowned, as I have often
                            seen. If a pup was born in the water it could not possibly live, and I
                            have never heard of such a case. A further fact in this connection is
                            that the females never come to the islands accompanied by a pup. After
                            birth a pup at once begins to suckle its mother, who leaves its
                            offspring only to go into the water for food, which I believe, from my
                            observation, consists mainly of fish, squids, and crustaceans. In her
                            search for food the female, in my opinion, goes 40 miles or even farther
                            from the islands. The pup does not appear to recognize its mother,
                            attempting to draw milk from any cow it comes in contact with; but a
                            mother will at once recognize her own pup and will allow no other to
                            nurse her. This I know from often observing a cow fight off other pups
                            who approached her and search out her own pup from among them, which I
                            think she recognizes by its smell and its cry.</p>
                        <p>When the pups are about 6 or 8 weeks old they begin to herd together in
                            groups called “pods;” these by degrees work down toward the shore, and
                            after several trials and failures at last find the use of their flippers
                            and learn to swim; from this time, the 1st of August or thereabouts, the
                            pup goes into the water at intervals, but remains most of the time on
                            the rookeries until about November, the time which the pup spends in the
                            water depending a great deal on the weather. Toward the first or middle
                            of November the pups leave the islands; they instinctively turn
                            southward toward the Aleutian Islands.</p>
                        <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0143"/>
                        <p>The time of their departure depends a good deal on the state of the
                            weather; if the winter is open, they may be found much later upon the
                            islands, and if particularly warm seals may be found during the whole
                            winter upon and about the islands. Probably, too, they are induced to
                            leave the islands in pursuit of food. In my opinion if the islands were
                            a little warmer in winter and not surrounded by ice, the seals would
                            remain there the year round, as they evidently consider the Pribilof
                            group their home.</p>
                        <p>From the islands the pup, with his fellows, goes southward, passing
                            through the passes between the Aleutian Islands, and holds its course
                            still south till lost sight of in the ocean. From this time until the
                            herd reappears off the California coast their course is a matter of
                            belief; but from information of sea captains of coasting vessels who
                            have sailed during the winter, seals during December and the first part
                            of January are found heading southeastwardly toward the Californian
                            coast. In January and February they begin to appear along that coast;
                            then turning northward they proceed along the coast, reaching Vancouver
                            Island about March, the southern Alaska coast in April and May, and in
                            June the herd reenters Bering Sea and proceeds again to their island
                            home. It is impossible to state the course or exact time of migration
                            with complete accuracy, but this course here designated I believe to be
                            approximately correct.</p>
                        <p>The pups which left the island the year before have now become
                            “yearlings,” the males and females herding together indiscriminately and
                            not coming on shore until some time in August or September; they also
                            leave the islands a little earlier than the first year and make the same
                            course of migration as before. On their second return to the island as
                            “two-year-olds” the sexes separate, the females going on the breeding
                            rookeries, where they are fertilized by the bulls, and the males hauling
                            up with the nonbreeding males, called “bachelors,” on the so-called
                            “hauling grounds.” The “two-year-olds” again migrate southward over the
                            same course as formerly. On their return to the islands the female goes
                            again to the breeding rookeries and there brings forth her first pup.
                            From this time forward she increases the seal herd by one pup annually,
                            and the male of the same age is on the hauling grounds and is now
                            considered of a tillable age.</p>
                        <p>The fourth and fifth migrations are practically the same as the third.
                            After the fifth or sixth migration the male seal, now called a bull,
                            returns to the islands about the 1st of May, and hauls up on the
                            breeding rookeries, provided he is able to maintain himself there, which
                            takes many bloody conflicts. There he gathers about him as many females
                            as he is able. From the time of his landing until the close of the
                            rutting season, or about the 1st of August, he remains continuously on
                            the breeding grounds, never eating, and sleeping very little, if at all.
                            About August 1 he again takes to the water, after having fertilized all
                            the cows in his harem, very lean and lank, and his harem becomes
                            disorganized, the pups gathering into pods, the females going and coming
                            from the water, and the bachelors mingling with the cows and pups.</p>
                        <p>The bachelors while on the islands, in my opinion, feed very little, and
                            practically it is only the female seals which feed while located on the
                            islands. The speed of a seal when swimming is very great, covering, I
                            should say, from 10 to 15 miles an hour. Therefore a female can easily
                            go to the feeding grounds and return to the islands in a day; and that,
                            so far as I am able to ascertain, the foregoing facts are practically
                            corroborated by all those who have had the opportunity to study or
                            observe seal life on the Pribilof Islands and in Bering Sea.</p>
                        <p>On my first arrival in the Pribilof Islands, in 1868, several other
                            vessels, representatives of different interests, were there for the
                            purpose of killing seals; and the natives of these islands, called
                            Aleuts, were nearly all employed by one or other of the vessels in the
                            business of killing seals. I noticed that the natives always
                            remonstrated whenever any female was killed, and stated that that was
                            forbidden, and I am informed that it always had been forbidden by the
                            Russian Government. All the seals killed by me or under my
                            superintendence on the islands have been male seals, except in the case
                            of accident. My knowledge of the catch of 1868 enables me to state that
                            the destruction of seals from all sources in that year was about
                            240,000. This is the maximum figure. Despite the lowering of the
                            standard weight of skins, care was taken annually on St. George that the
                            residue of available male breeders was sufficient for the needs of the
                            rookeries, and instructions to that effect were given to the assistants
                            by the superintendent of the Alaska Commercial Company. In this we were
                            aided by the inaccessible character of some of the hauling grounds.</p>
                        <p>From the year 1874 till 1885 we were able to get from St. George and St.
                            Paul islands annually 100,000 male seals within the period known as the
                            sealing season of six weeks, from the 10th of June to the 1st of August,
                            and still leave a large percentage <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126"
                                facs="0144"/>of marketable seals. In 1885, and in every year
                            thereafter until I left, in 1887, there was a marked decrease in the
                            number of marketable skins that could be obtained in each year during
                            the sealing season. We were able down to the last year (1887) to get our
                            total catch of 100,000 seals, but in order to get that number we had to
                            take what in previous years we would have rejected, namely, undersized
                            skins, i. e., the skins of young seals. Prior to 1887 we had endeavored
                            to take no skins weighing less than 8 pounds, but in order to make up
                            our quota in the last-mentioned year we had to take skins weighing as
                            little as 6½ pounds to the number of several thousand.</p>
                        <p>In the years 1885, 1886, and 1887 my attention was attracted not only to
                            a diminution in the number of killable seals appearing on the island,
                            but to a decrease in the females as well. Up to the year 1884 the
                            breeding space in the rookeries had increased, and from that year down
                            to 1887, when I left the island, the acreage covered by the rookeries
                            which were occupied by seals constantly diminished. Naturally the cause
                            of this diminution was a matter of interest and inquiry. It was not
                            evident that it was from causes incident to the taking of seals upon the
                            island. The greatest care was exercised in the driving. Under precisely
                            similar conditions the herd had increased in former years. The number of
                            skins originally apportioned to St. George Island were reduced at an
                            early date, and only increased in proportion to the rookeries’
                            expansion. No disturbance of the rookeries was permitted, even the
                            presence of dogs and use of firearms being prohibited during the
                            presence of the seals; but facts came under my observation that soon led
                            me to what I believe to be the true cause of destruction—for instance,
                            during the period of my residence on St. George Island down to the year
                            1884 there were always a number of dead pups, the number of which I can
                            not give exactly, as it varied from year to year and was dependent upon
                            accidents or the destructiveness of storms. Young seals do not know how
                            to swim from birth, nor do they learn how for six weeks or two months
                            after birth, and therefore are at the mercy of the waves during stormy
                            weather. But from the year 1884 down to the period when I left St.
                            George Island there was a marked increase in the number of dead pup
                            seals, amounting, perhaps, to a trebling of the numbers observed in
                            former years, so that I would estimate the number of dead pups in the
                            year 1887 at about five or seven thousand as a maximum.</p>
                        <p>I also noticed during my last two or three years, among the number of
                            dead pups, an increase of at least 70 per cent of those which were
                            emaciated and poor, and in my judgment they died from want of
                            nourishment, their mothers having been killed while away from the island
                            feeding, because it is a fact that pups drowned or killed by accidents
                            were almost invariably fat. Learning further, through the London sales,
                            of the increase in the pelagic sealing, it became my firm conviction
                            that the constant increase in the number of dead pups and the decrease
                            in the number of marketable seals and breeding females found on the
                            islands during the years 1885, 1886, and 1887 were caused by the
                            destruction of female seals in the open sea, either before or after
                            giving birth to the pups. The mother seals go to feeding grounds distant
                            from the islands, and I can only account for the number of starved pups
                            by supposing that their mothers are killed while feeding.</p>
                        <p>As I understand the fact to be, most of the seals killed in the open sea
                            are females. My reasons for this conclusion are (1) that from my
                            knowledge of the seal I know that the females when heavy with young, as
                            they are during the early part of the season when on their way to the
                            rookeries, where they are delivered during the months of June and July,
                            are much heavier in the water and much less able to escape, because they
                            are capable of remaining under water to escape for a very much less
                            period of time than when they are not heavy with young, or than the male
                            seal would be; and (2) because I have personally inspected skins taken
                            upon the three schooners <hi rend="italic">Onward, Caroline</hi>, and
                                <hi rend="italic">Thornton</hi>, which skins, taken in Bering Sea,
                            were landed in Unalaska, and were then personally inspected by me in the
                            month of May, 1887. The total number of skins so examined by me was
                            about 2,000, and of that number at least 80 per cent were the skins of
                            females. I have also examined the skins taken by the United States
                            revenue cutter <hi rend="italic">Rush</hi> from one of the North Pacific
                            islands, where they had been deposited by what is known as a poaching
                            schooner, and taken to Unalaska, which numbered about 400 skins, and of
                            that 400 skins at least 80 per cent were the skins of female seals. I
                            have also examined the skins seized from the <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis</hi> in the year 1891 by the Russian gunboat <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleute</hi>, numbering 416, of which at least 90 per
                            cent were the skins of female seals, and from my long observation of
                            seals and seal skins I am able to tell the difference between the skin
                            of a male and the skin of a female seal.</p>
                        <p>From my knowledge of the aquatic habits of the seal and the difficulty of
                            accurate shooting when the object is in the water, I am of the opinion
                            that a large number of seals are also killed by vessels engaged in the
                            business of taking seals in the open seas which are not caught. I am
                            unable to form any estimate of the number of seals shot or speared from
                            vessels, which are lost, but in the last two or three years, of my <pb
                                n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0145"/>residence at St. George Island
                            in taking 15,000 seals I found approximately 3 pounds of lead, in the
                            form of slugs, bullets, and buckshot, which I personally took from the
                            bodies of male seals, some of which were so badly wounded that they
                            would have died; and I have personally examined the log of the schooner
                                <hi rend="italic">Angel Dollie</hi>, in which it was stated that the
                            hunters from that vessel got about one seal out of every ten seals shot
                            at; also that on one occasion they fired 250 rounds and got 20 seals; on
                            another occasion, 100 cartridges and got 6 seals, and which log also
                            stated that the captain personally shot and killed 7 seals of which he
                            got only 1.</p>
                        <p>Deponent further says that he thinks that the decrease in the number of
                            seals found in the rookeries and the increase in the number of dead pups
                            are caused directly by the open-sea sealing, commonly called poaching,
                            and that the prohibition of such poaching is necessary to the
                            preservation of the herds, and that from what he has himself seen he
                            thinks if such poaching be not prohibited the herds will be practically
                            exterminated within five years. One cause of destruction is raiding,
                            which has been done upon the shores of the islands. A half dozen such
                            raids are known to me personally; but while it is not possible for me to
                            state with certainty the skins actually secured by such raids, I believe
                            that, although such raiding is detrimental, its injurious effect, as
                            compared with the disastrous results of pelagic sealing, is
                            insignificant.</p>

                        <p>William H. Williams, being duly sworn, deposes and says: I reside at
                            Wellington, Ohio, and am 55 years of age; that I am the United States
                            Treasury agent in charge of the Seal Islands in Bering Sea; that in
                            pursuance of Department instructions to me of May 27, 1891, I made a
                            careful examination during the sealing season of the habits, numbers,
                            and conditions of the seals and seal rookeries with a view of reporting
                            to the Department, from observation and such knowledge on the subject as
                            I might obtain, whether or not, in my opinion, the seals are diminishing
                            on the Pribilof Islands, and if so, the causes therefor; that as a
                            result of such investigation I found, from the statements made to me by
                            the natives on said islands, Government agents, employees of the
                            lessees, some of whom had been on said islands for many years, that a
                            decrease in number of seals had been gradually going on since 1885, and
                            that in the last three years the decrease had been very rapid.</p>
                        <p>A careful and frequent examination of the hauling grounds and breeding
                            rookeries by myself and assistant agents during the months of June,
                            July, and August showed that the seals had greatly diminished in number,
                            and we found large vacant spaces on all the rookeries which in former
                            years, during these months, had been covered by thousands of seals; that
                            prior to 1888 the lessees had been able to take 100,000 skins from male
                            seals, but I am clearly of the opinion that not more than one-third of
                            that number of merchantable skins could have been taken during the year
                            1891. Furthermore, I made careful inquiry of the people on the islands,
                            both native and white, and of those who were or had been employed as
                            masters or mates on sealing vessels, and others interested one way or
                            another in the capture of fur-seals for food or for profit, and failed
                            to find any of them but who admitted that the number of seals in the
                            Bering Sea was much less now than a few years since, and nearly all of
                            them gave it as their opinion that the decrease in number was due to
                            pelagic hunting, or, as they more frequently expressed it, the killing
                            of females in the water. It was freely admitted by the pelagic hunters
                            with whom I conversed that but a very small per cent of their catch was
                            males, and I found their statements in this respect verified by the
                            dealers who bought or handled the skins and placed them on the market.
                            They are known to the trade as the “Northwest coast catch,” and I am
                            credibly informed that a portion of the skin on the belly of the female
                            heavy with pup or giving suck to her young is worthless, and that this
                            is one of the chief causes why they are sold so much less than prime
                            skins in the London market. They also further stated that the two most
                            profitable periods for them to catch seal was in the spring of the year,
                            when the females were heavy with pup and frequently found asleep on the
                            water, and in the summer, after the mother seal had given birth to her
                            young and gone out into the sea to feed, at which time she was easily
                            approached.</p>
                        <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0146"/>
                        <p>The investigation further disclosed the fact that of the large number of
                            seals killed by pelagic hunters only a portion of them are secured, and
                            while all admitted that some were lost they differed considerably as to
                            the number. In one instance a hunter claimed that he secured nearly all
                            that he killed, and in another instance it was said that only one out of
                            fifteen was secured. A great majority of the hunters, when closely
                            questioned, admitted the losing of a large proportion shot at, and I am
                            of the opinion that the wide difference in their statement was due to
                            two facts: First, some hunters are more skilful than others; and,
                            second, some base their estimate on what they know to have been actually
                            killed, while others estimate from the number shot at; that the mother
                            seals, while rearing their young on the Pribilof Islands during the
                            months of July, August, September, and October of each year, leave the
                            islands and go out to sea to feed, returning at intervals to give
                            nourishment to their young. That they traveled long distances in pursuit
                            of food at these times is a wellknown fact and substantiated by the
                            statements of reputable persons who have been on sealing vessels and
                            seen them killed 200 miles or more from the islands, and who say they
                            have seen the decks of vessels slippery with milk flowing from the
                            carcasses of the dead females.</p>
                        <p>That thousands of the female seals were captured by the pelagic hunters
                            in Bering Sea during the season of 1891, the most of which had to be
                            secured quite a distance from the rookeries, owing to the presence of
                            armed vessels patrolling the sea for miles around the islands, and that
                            the slaughter of the seals was mostly of females, was confirmed by the
                            thousands of dead pups lying on the rookeries starved to death by the
                            destruction of their mothers.</p>
                        <p>It is a fact that none but male seals are ever driven and killed on the
                            islands, and great care is taken to preserve a sufficient number each
                            year to supply the breeding rookeries.</p>
                        <p>During the season of 1891 nearly every mature female coming upon the
                            rookeries gave birth to a young seal, and there was great abundance of
                            males of sufficient age to again go upon the breeding grounds that year,
                            as was shown by the inability of large numbers of them to secure more,
                            than one to five cows each, while quite a number could secure none at
                            all. My investigation confirms what has been so often said by others who
                            have reported upon this subject, and that is that the Pribilof Islands
                            are the greatest breeding grounds of the fur seals, and that they can be
                            reared in great numbers on said islands, and at the same time, under
                            wise and judicious restrictions, a certain number of male seals can be
                            killed from year to year without injury to the breeding herds, and their
                            skins disposed of for commercial purposes, thereby building up and
                            perpetuating this great industry indefinitely, and thus adding to the
                            wealth, happiness, and comfort of the civilized world; while on the
                            other hand, if the pelagic hunting of this animal is to continue, and
                            the barbarous practice of killing the mother seal with her unborn young,
                            or when she is rearing it, is to go on, it will be but a very short time
                            before the fur seal will practically become extinct, and this valuable
                            industry will pass out of existence.</p>

                        <p>Kerriek Artomanoff, being duly sworn, deposes and says: I am a native
                            Aleut, and reside on St. Paul Island, Pribilof Group, Alaska; I was born
                            at Northeast Point, on St. Paul Island, and am 67 years of age. I have
                            worked on the sealing grounds for the last fifty years, and am well
                            acquainted with the methods adopted by the Russian and American
                            Governments in taking of fur-seal skins and in protecting and preserving
                            the herds on the island. In 1870, when the Alaska Commercial Company
                            obtained the lease of the islands, I was made chief, and held the
                            position for seventeen years.</p>
                        <p>It was my duty as chief to take charge of and conduct the drives with my
                            people from the hauling to the killing grounds. The methods used by the
                            Alaska Commercial Company and the American Government for the care and
                            preservation of the seals were much better than those used by the
                            Russian Government. In old Russian times <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129"
                                facs="0147"/>we used to drive seals from Northeast Point to the
                            village, a distance of nearly 13 miles, and we used to drive 5 or 6
                            miles from other hauling grounds; but when the Americans got the islands
                            they soon after shortened all the drives to less than 3 miles.</p>
                        <p>From 1870 to 1884 the seals were swarming on the hauling grounds and the
                            rookeries, and for many years they spread out more and more. All of a
                            sudden, in 1884, we noticed there was not so many seals, and they have
                            been decreasing very rapidly ever since. My people wondered why this was
                            so, and no one could tell why, until we learned that hunters in
                            schooners were shooting and destroying them in the sea. Then we knew
                            what the trouble was, for we knew the seals they killed and destroyed
                            must be cows, for most all the males remain on or near the islands until
                            they go away in the fall or fore part of the winter. We also noticed
                            dead pups on the rookeries, that had been starved to death. These dead
                            pups have increased from year to year since 1887, and in 1891 the
                            rookeries were covered with dead pups. In my sixty-seven years’
                            residence on the island I never before saw anything like it. None of our
                            people have ever known of any sickness among the pups or seals, and have
                            never seen any dead pups on the rookeries, except a few killed by the
                            old bulls when fighting, or by drowning when the surf washed them off.
                            If they had not killed the seals in the sea there would be as many on
                            the rookeries as there was ten years ago. There was not more than
                            one-fourth as many seals in 1891 as there was in 1880.</p>
                        <p>The fur seal goes away from the island in the fall or winter, and he
                            returns in May or June, and I believe he will haul up in the same place
                            each year, for I particularly noticed some that I could tell that hauled
                            up in the same place for a number of years; and when we make drives
                            those we do not kill but let go into the water are all back where we
                            took them from in a few hours. The pups are born between the middle of
                            June and the middle of July, and can not swim until they are six or
                            seven weeks old; and if born in the water they would die. I have seen
                            the surf wash some of the young pups into the sea, and they drowned in a
                            very short time. In four or five days after it is born the mother seal
                            leaves her pup and goes away to the sea to feed, and when the pup is two
                            or three weeks old the mother often stays away for five or six days at a
                            time. The mother seals know their own pups by smelling them, and no seal
                            will allow any but her own pup to suck her. When the pups grow to be six
                            or eight weeks old they form in “pods” and work down to the shore, and
                            they try the water at the edge until they learn to swim. They will
                            remain on the island until November, and if not too cold will stay till
                            December. I have seen them swimming around the island late in January.
                            All the seals, when they leave the island, go off south, but I think
                            they would stay around here all winter if the weather was not so
                            cold.</p>
                        <p>When they come back to the islands they come from the south, and I think
                            they come from the North Pacific Ocean over the same track that they
                            went. The females go upon the rookeries as soon as they arrive here, but
                            the yearlings do not come on land till the last of July, and yearling
                            males and females herd together. I think they stay in the water most of
                            the time the first year, but after that they come regularly to the
                            hauling grounds and rookeries, but do not come as early in the season as
                            they do after they are two years old. Male seals from two to six years
                            old do not go on the breeding rookeries, but haul out by themselves. The
                            female seal gives birth to but one pup every year, and she has her first
                            pup when she is three years old. The male seal establishes himself on
                            the breeding rookery by May or June when he is seven or eight years old,
                            and he fights for his cows and does not leave the place he has selected
                            until August or September. Our people like the meat of the seal, and we
                            eat no other meat so long as we can get it.</p>
                        <p>The pup seals are our chicken meat, and we used to be allowed to kill
                            3,000 or 4,000 male pups every year in November; but the Government
                            agent forbade us to kill any in 1891, and said we should not be allowed
                            to kill any more, and he gave us other meat in place of “pup” meat; but
                            we do not like any other meat as well as pup-seal meat. We understand
                            the danger there is in the seals being all killed off and that we will
                            have no way of earning our living. There is not one of us but what
                            believes if they had not killed them off by shooting them in the water
                            there would be as many seals on the island now as there was in 1880, and
                            we could go on forever taking 100,000 seals on the two islands; but if
                            they get less as fast as they have in the last five or six years there
                            will be none left in a little while.</p>

                        <p>John Fratis, being duly sworn, deposes and says: I am 47 years of age,
                            and was born on the Ladrone Islands. I can speak the English, Russian,
                            and Spanish languages, and I understand the Aleut as it is spoken by the
                            natives of St. Paul Island, Alaska.</p>
                        <p>I came to St. Paul Island in 1869, and married a native woman and became
                            one of the people; was made a native sealer, and have resided here ever
                            since.</p>
                        <p>From 1859 to 1869 I was employed on whaling vessels working in Bering and
                            Okhotsk seas and the Arctic Ocean. I have been along the coast of Bering
                            and Okhotsk seas, and along the coast of Alaska in the North Pacific
                            Ocean from Sitka to Unalaska, and I never saw or heard tell of any place
                            in American waters in that whole region where the Alaskan fur seals haul
                            out on land or breed, excepting on the seal islands of Bering Sea known
                            as the Pribilof Islands.</p>
                        <p>From the time I settled here, in 1869, until 1882 or 1883 there was no
                            trouble at all in taking 85,000 seals on St. Paul Island between June 1
                            and July 30, and we often got that number by July 20.</p>
                        <p>In those days we used to get plenty of seals on the Zoltoi sands near the
                            Reef rookery, and now there are none there. I have worked on the sealing
                            grounds at everything there is to do, from driving to clubbing, and
                            preparing the skins for shipment.</p>
                        <p>When Mr. Webster had charge of the killing at Northeast Point, where he
                            used to kill from 25,000 to 35,000 seals in a season, I generally did
                            the cooking there, and I cooked seal meat every day, and we all ate it,
                            and our people live on seal meat, yet I never saw a sick or a diseased
                            seal or a carcass that was unfit for food.</p>
                        <p>I have driven seals from all the rookeries and under the directions of
                            several chiefs, and I know the orders were always very strict about the
                            care we must take of the seals on the road. No drives were made in warm
                            weather; the seals were not hurried, but every once in a while they were
                            allowed to stop and rest. The men who did the driving were relieved from
                            time to time, so that no man should get too cold on the drive, and when
                            the sun came out warm the drive was always abandoned and the seals
                            allowed to go into the sea. I never saw the seals overdriven or
                            overheated, nor have I ever seen a seal die on the drive, except one or
                            two occasionally smothered.</p>
                        <p>The drivers carry their knives along, and when a seal dies they skin him,
                            and the skin is brought to the salt-house and counted in with the
                            others.</p>
                        <p>An overheated seal would not be worth skinning, and for that reason the
                            company agent is particular that the seals are not overheated. I have
                            clubbed seals, too, and at present am a regular clubber.</p>
                        <p>We know a cow seal on sight, and when we find one on the killing grounds
                            we take care she is not injured. Very few cows get into the drives
                            before the middle of August, and then we are only driving and killing a
                            few hundred a week for food.</p>
                        <p>All cows killed on the seal islands are killed accidentally, and it
                            occurs so seldom that I do not think there has been to exceed 100 since
                            I came to the island, in 1869. So carefully has this been guarded that
                            when we used to be allowed to kill pup seals in November we had to
                            examine and separate the sexes and kill none but males.</p>
                        <p>The seals came to the islands in spring, and they came from the
                            southward.</p>
                        <p>The first bulls arrive late in April or very early in May, and they are
                            coming along till June. The bachelors come in May, the older ones first,
                            and they continue coming till July, when the younger ones arrive. The
                            cows appear about the 10th of June, and they are all on the rookeries
                            about the middle of July.</p>
                        <p>The pups are born soon after the arrival of the cows, and they are
                            helpless and can not swim, and they would drown if put into water. The
                            pups have no sustenance except what the cows furnish, and no cow suckles
                            any pup but her own. The pups would suck any cow if the cow would let
                            them.</p>
                        <p>After the pup is a few days old the cow goes into the sea to feed, and at
                            first she will only stay away for a few hours, but as the pup grows
                            stronger she will stay away more and more, until she will sometimes be
                            away for a week.</p>
                        <p>I do not think the bachelors go to feed from the time they haul out until
                            they leave the islands in November, for I have observed the males killed
                            in May are fat and their stomachs full of fish, mostly codfish, while
                            the males killed in July and afterwards are poorer and poorer, and their
                            stomachs are empty. I know the bulls do not eat during their four
                            months’ stay on the islands.</p>
                        <p>In August the families, or harems, break mp, and the cows scatter all
                            over the rookeries, and the bulls begin to go away late in August and
                            all through September, <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0149"/>so that
                            very few are left in October. The cows and bachelors begin to leave in
                            October and November, but their going is regulated somewhat by the
                            weather.</p>
                        <p>Cold, stormy weather, with sudden heavy frost, will drive them off
                            sooner, so that the islands will be deserted by December 15, while warm
                            weather will keep plenty of bachelors here until late in January, when I
                            have known them to be driven and killed for food. When the seals leave
                            the island they go southward and through the passes of the Aleutian
                            Islands into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
                        <p>It was in 1884 that I first noticed a decrease in the seals, and it has
                            been a steady and a very rapid decrease ever since 1886, so that at
                            present there is not one-quarter as many seals on the island as there
                            was every year from 1869 to 1883.</p>
                        <p>I have known of one or two schooners operating in Bering Sea as early as
                            1877 or 1878, and they were on the rookeries occasionally during the
                            past ten years; but they can not damage the seal herd much by raiding
                            the rookeries, because they can not take many, even were they permitted
                            to land, which they are not by any means.</p>
                        <p>The schooners increased every year from the time I first noticed them
                            until in 1884 there was a fleet of 20 or 30, and then I began to see
                            more and more dead pups on the rookeries, until in 1891 the fleet of
                            sealing schooners numbered more than a hundred, and the rookeries were
                            covered with dead pups.</p>
                        <p>It is my opinion that the cows are killed by the hunters when they go out
                            in the sea to feed, and the pups are left to die, and do die on the
                            island.</p>
                        <p>I never knew of a time when there were not plenty of bulls for all the
                            cows, and I never saw a cow seal, except a 2-year-old, without a pup by
                            her side in the proper season. I never heard tell of an impotent bull
                            seal, nor do I believe there is such a thing, except the very old and
                            feeble, or badly wounded ones. I have seen hundreds of idle vigorous
                            bulls upon the rookeries and there were no cows for them. I saw many
                            such bulls last year.</p>
                        <p>The pups do not learn to swim until they are six to eight weeks old, and
                            after learning they seem to prefer to be on the land; and I think they
                            would not leave the islands only for the cold weather, or it may be they
                            follow the cows to sea after being weaned.</p>
                        <p>If the seals were let alone in the water we could manage them so as to
                            again build up the rookeries. We are so familiar with their habits, and
                            they are so accustomed to us, that there is no difficulty in managing
                            them so as to make them increase. They are easy to handle, the little
                            pups are not shy of us, and even when they are older in the fall they
                            can be handled much easier than sheep. I can manage seals better than I
                            can some of the sheep brought on the islands, and which I have been sent
                            to catch.</p>

                        <p>Charles J. Goff, of Clarksburg, W. Va., being duly sworn, deposes and
                            says: I am 45 years of age. During the years 1889 and 1890 I occupied
                            the position of special Treasury agent in charge of the Pribilof
                            Islands. I was located on St. Paul Island, only visiting St. George
                            Island occasionally. About the 1st June, 1889, I arrived on St. Paul
                            Island, and remained there until October 12, 1889, when I returned to
                            San Francisco for the winter. Again went to the islands in 1890,
                            arriving there about the last week in May, and remaining until August
                            12, 1890. Since that time I have never been on the islands. My principal
                            observations as to seal life upon the islands were confined to St. Paul
                            Island, as I only visited St. George Island occasionally.</p>
                        <p>During my first year on the islands the Alaska Commercial Company was the
                            lessee thereof, and during my second year the North American Commercial
                            Company. In 1889 I made careful observations of the rookeries on St.
                            Paul Island, and marked out the areas covered by the breeding grounds;
                            in 1890 I examined these <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0150"/>lines
                            made by me the former year and found a very great shrinkage in the
                            spaces covered by breeding seals.</p>
                        <p>In 1889 it was quite difficult for the lessees to obtain their full quota
                            of 100,000 skins; so difficult was it, in fact, that in order to turn
                            off a sufficient number of four and five year old males from the hauling
                            grounds for breeding purposes in the future the lessees were compelled
                            to take about 50,000 skins of seals of one or two years of age. I at
                            once reported this fact to the Secretary of the Treasury, and advised
                            the taking of a less number of skins the following year. Pursuant to
                            such report the Government fixed upon the number to be taken as 60,000,
                            and further ordered that all killing of seals upon the islands should
                            stop after the 20th day of July. I was further ordered that I should
                            notify the natives upon the Aleutian Islands that all killing of seals
                            while coming from or going to the seal islands was prohibited. These
                            rules and regulations went into effect in 1890, and pursuant thereto I
                            posted notices for the natives at various points along the Aleutian
                            chain, and saw that the orders in relation to the time of killing and
                            number allowed to be killed were executed upon the islands. As a result
                            of the enforcement of these regulations the lessees were unable to take
                            more then 21,238 seals of the killable age of from 1 to 5 years during
                            the season of 1890, so great had been the decrease of seal life in one
                            year, and it would have been impossible to obtain 60,000 skins, even if
                            the time had been unrestricted.</p>
                        <p>The Table A appended to this affidavit shows how great had been the
                            decrease on St. Paul Islands hauling grounds, bearing in mind the fact
                            that the driving and killing was done by the same persons as in former
                            years and was as diligently carried on, the weather being as favorable
                            as in 1889 for seal driving. I believe that the sole cause of the
                            decrease is pelagic sealing, which from reliable information I
                            understand to have increased greatly since 1884 or 1885. Another fact I
                            have gained from reliable sources is that the great majority of the
                            seals taken in the open sea are pregnant females or females in milk. It
                            is an unquestionable fact that the killing of these females destroys the
                            pups they are carrying or nursing. The result is that this destruction
                            of pups takes about equally from the male and female increase of the
                            herd, and when so many male pups are killed in this manner, besides the
                            100,000 taken from the islands, it necessarily affects the number of
                            killable seals. In 1889 this drain upon male seal life showed itself on
                            the islands, and this, in my opinion, accounts for the necessity of the
                            lessees taking so many young seals that year to fill out their
                            quota.</p>
                        <p>As soon as the effects of pelagic sealing were noticed by me upon the
                            islands I reported the same, and the Government at once took steps to
                            limit the killing upon the islands, so that the rookeries might have an
                            opportunity to increase their numbers to their former condition; but it
                            will be impossible to repair the depletion if pelagic sealing continues.
                            I have no doubt, as I reported, that the taking of 100,000 skins in 1889
                            affected the male life on the islands and cut into the reserve of male
                            seals necessary to preserve annually for breeding purposes in the
                            future; but this fact did not become evident until it was too late to
                            repair the fault that year. Except for the numbers destroyed by pelagic
                            sealing in the years previous to 1889 the hauling grounds would not have
                            been so depleted, and the taking of 100,000 male seals would not have
                            impaired the reserve for breeding purposes or diminished to any extent
                            the seal life on the Pribilof Islands. Even in this diminished state of
                            the rookeries in 1889 I carefully observed that in the majority of cases
                            the four and five year old males were allowed to drop out of a “drive”
                            before the bachelors have been driven any distance from the hauling
                            grounds. These seals were let go for the sole purpose of supplying
                            sufficient future breeders.</p>
                        <p>A few seals are injured by redriving (often conflicted with overdriving,
                            and sometimes so called), but the number so injured is inconsiderable,
                            and could have no appreciable effect upon seal life, though destroying
                            the virility of the male. The decrease, caused by pelagic sealing,
                            compelled whatever injurious redriving has taken place on the islands,
                            as it was often necessary to drive every two or three days from the same
                            hauling grounds, which caused many seals let go in a former “drive” to
                            be driven over again before thoroughly rested. If a “drive” was made
                            only once a week from a certain hauling ground, as had been the case
                            before pelagic sealing grew to such enormous proportions and depleted
                            the rookeries, there would be no damage at all resulting from
                            redriving.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion pelagic sealing is the cause of redriving on the islands,
                            the depletion of the rookeries, and promises to soon make the Alaska
                            fur-seal herd a thing of the past. If it continued as it is to-day, even
                            if killing on the islands was absolutely forbidden, the herd will in a
                            few years be exterminated. I am, therefore, of the opinion that pelagic
                            sealing should be absolutely prohibited both in Bering Sea and the North
                            Pacific Ocean. If this is done and a few years are allowed the seal herd
                                <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0151"/>to recover from the
                            enormous slaughter of the past seven years, the Pribilof Islands will
                            produce their 100,000 skins as heretofore for an indefinite period.</p>

                        <p>Aggie Kushen, being duly sworn, deposes and says: I was born at Simshoe,
                            Kurile Islands, and am 37 years of age. I came to St. Paul Island in
                            1867, and have resided here ever since. I can read and write in the
                            Russian and Aleut languages, and am able to interpret the one into the
                            other; and I understand the English language fairly well. At present,
                            and for several years past, I am assistant priest in the Greek Catholic
                            Church. My occupation on the island is that of a native sealer, and I
                            have been such since 1870. I have a thorough knowledge of the taking of
                            fur seals for skins in all its details as it has been done on St. Paul
                            Island since 1870. From 1870 to about 1884 the seal rookeries were
                            always filled out to their limits, and sometimes beyond them.</p>
                        <p>About 1885 a decrease was observed, and that decrease has become more
                            marked every year from 1885 to the present time. I never saw many
                            sealing schooners before 1884, but they have been coming more and more
                            every year since, and I notice that as the schooners multiply in the sea
                            the seals decrease on the rookeries. I do not mean to say that the seals
                            were injured because a few were killed on the rookeries, when men from
                            schooners landed on the islands in the night or when the fog was very
                            thick, for the numbers killed in that way never amounted to much, as it
                            is not often the raiders can land on a rookery and escape with their
                            plunder. When, in 1886, we all saw the decrease of seals upon the
                            hauling grounds and rookeries, we asked each other what was the cause of
                            it, but when we learned that white men were shooting seals in the water
                            with guns we knew what was the matter; we knew that if they killed seals
                            in the water that they must be nearly all females that were going out to
                            feed, for the males stay on the islands until they get ready to go away
                            in the fall or winter. It was among the cows that we first noticed the
                            decrease, and as we never kill the cows on the islands we knew that they
                            must be killing them in the water. We noticed idle, vigorous bulls on
                            the breeding rookeries because of the scarcity of cows, and I have
                            noticed that the cows have decreased steadily every year since 1886, but
                            more particularly so in 1888, 1889, 1890, and 1891.</p>
                        <p>There was a great number of dead pups upon the rookeries last year, whose
                            mothers, I believe, were killed at sea by sealing schooners, and I do
                            not expect to see many cows this year. I never saw a dead grown seal on
                            the island during my twentyfive years’ residence here, except odd ones
                            that had been killed in fighting for places on the rookeries.</p>
                        <p>I never heard any of the old men who have lived here for fifty years
                            before my time speak of such a thing as sickness or death among the
                            seals. We eat the flesh of the seal, and it constitutes the meat supply
                            of the natives; and seals from two to five years old have been killed by
                            them for food every week during their stay on the land ever since the
                            islands were peopled, and no one has yet found a diseased seal, either
                            young or old.</p>
                        <p>I have been told that there are persons who claim we are not careful in
                            driving seals, and that we kill them regardless of sex. These statements
                            are not true. I have taken my turn at driving seals from the hauling to
                            the killing grounds every year since 1870, and I know the driving is
                            very carefully done. When I first came here seals used to be driven from
                            Halfway Point to the village, a distance of about 6 miles; and from
                            Zapadnie to the village, a distance of nearly 5 miles. Wet, or very
                            damp, cool weather was chosen for such drives, and we started the drive
                            at about 6 o’clock at night, and driving all night reached the village
                            at from 6 to 8 o’clock next morning.</p>
                        <p>Half a mile in one hour was about the rate of speed on such drives in
                            favorable weather, and I do not know of any drives of over 2 miles where
                            we ever went at a greater speed.</p>
                        <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0152"/>
                        <p>All long drives were stopped in 1879 when the Alaska Commercial Company
                            made a killing ground and built a salt house within 2 miles of Halfway
                            Point, and made a killing ground within a mile of Zapadnie. Since these
                            changes were made no seals have been driven on St. Paul Island over 2
                            miles to a killing ground.</p>
                        <p>The seals are never driven at a greater speed than 1 mile in three hours;
                            and the men who do the driving have to relieve each other on the road,
                            because they travel so slowly they get very cold.</p>
                        <p>In a very large drive a small seal may be smothered, but that does not
                            injure the skin, which is taken and salted and counted to the lessees;
                            and the greatest number I ever saw die on the drive was 20 out of a
                            drive of about 9,000 seals, and the 20 skins were good and were accepted
                            as “first class.” The bull seal arrives at the island early in May, and
                            takes his place on the breeding rookery, and he stays there until August
                            or September without food. About the middle of May the young males begin
                            to haul out, but are driven off by the bulls, who would tear them to
                            pieces if they went on the breeding rookeries. Consequently the
                            bachelors haul out by themselves, and are easily surrounded and driven
                            into the killing ground without disturbing the breeding rookery.</p>
                        <p>The cows begin to haul out in June, and take their places on the breeding
                            rookeries beside the bulls, where the young pups are born in from one to
                            three days after the arrival of the cows.</p>
                        <p>When the cow goes into the sea for food, her stay there becomes longer
                            and longer as the season advances, until at times she will be away for
                            three or four days at a time.</p>
                        <p>The pups when first born can not swim, and will drown if they are put
                            into water.</p>
                        <p>I have seen many pups drowned when washed off the edge of the rookery by
                            the surf. They do not go into the water until they are six or eight
                            weeks old, and then they will keep in shallow water and close to the
                            shore for several days more.</p>
                        <p>They seem to like to stay on land until late in the season. Every native
                            knows a female seal at sight, and, as the law against killing a female
                            is strict and so rigidly enforced, and as the clubbers are the most
                            experienced and most careful men on the island, it is very seldom that
                            any female seal is clubbed. Our people have great respect for law, and
                            are always ready to obey any rules laid down by the proper authority,
                            and they have been raised in the firm belief that it is wrong to kill a
                            cow seal. No one knows better than the natives that our prosperity is in
                            the protection of the seals. They are our food supply, and our earnings
                            from taking the skins enable us to live comfortably. Should the company
                            desire us to kill female seals, every native in the village would be
                            interested in having the Government officer know it. The instructions we
                            have always received from the company was to be careful in driving, and
                            to never kill a female seal.</p>
                        <p>During the month of August the families break up and the seals scatter
                            around, and some of the cows mingle with the young males and are driven
                            along with them when we make a drive for food, and sometimes one or two
                            are killed accidentally. It is so seldom that this occurs I do not think
                            that there has been more than about 10 cows per year killed on St. Paul
                            Island since 1870.</p>
                        <p>The skins taken from seals killed for food are salted and counted to the
                            lessees on the quota of the following year, so that nothing may be
                            wasted. When we were allowed to kill pups in November for food and
                            clothing, we always picked out the males, because we were not allowed to
                            kill female pups, and now we are not allowed to kill any pups at all.
                            When the seals leave the island they go to the southward, and when they
                            come back in the spring they come from that direction. The bulls begin
                            to leave the island about the middle of August, and most of them are
                            gone by the middle of September. The cows and bachelors leave in
                            November, and the pups follow or go with the cows. When the weather is
                            good, a number of seals will cling to the beach or remain in the water
                            around the rookeries until December, and sometimes until late in
                            January. I have noticed more and more dead pups on the rookeries every
                            year since 1888, and in 1891 they were so close together in places I
                            could not step among them without stepping on a dead pup. I saw many of
                            them cut open and examined by the doctor (Dr. Ackerly) and their
                            stomachs were empty. All of the dead pups were poor and thin and
                            starved.</p>
                        <p>I believe they all died of starvation, because their mothers had been
                            shot at sea when they went out to feed. I never saw a full fat pup or
                            one who had a mother to feed him dead, except a few that were drowned in
                            the surf. No cow will suckle any pup but her own, and I have often
                            watched a cow driving pups from her until she found her own. She knows
                            her pup by smelling it.</p>
                        <p>There are not one-fourth as many seals now as there were in 1882, and our
                            people are very much alarmed to know what is to become of them after the
                            seals are killed <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0153"/>off. If the
                            seals decrease as fast as they have during the past five or six years,
                            there will be none left in a very short time for us to live upon.</p>

                        <p>Before me, F. H. Newcomb, a first lieutenant in the United States
                            Revenue-Marine Service, and executive officer of the U. S. revenue

                            take testimony and administer oaths, personally appeared Anton
                            Melovedoff, who, being by me first duly sworn according to law,
                            testified as follows, to wit:</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>Q. To what do you attribute the decrease in the number of seals on the
                            rookeries?—A. To the great number of cows killed by poachers, and
                            consequently less pups are born on the rookeries.</p>
                        <p>Q. How do you know that cows have been killed by poachers?—A. I have
                            handled and seen a great number of skins captured by the revenue cutters
                            from the poaching vessels, and there were very few male skins among
                            them; also have seen among them a great number of unborn pups. Twice
                            upon the rookeries I have seen cows killed and left there by the
                            poachers.</p>
                        <p>Q. Why is it, in your opinion, that more female than male seals are
                            killed by the poachers?—A. Because, first, in the passage of the seals
                            to the islands in the early season the females travel in groups and the
                            males scatter; secondly, after arriving at the islands the males remain
                            on or about the hauling grounds, while the females, having their pups to
                            nurse, go out into sea to obtain food.</p>
                        <p>Q. How do you tell the skin of a female from that of a male?—A. By the
                            nipples and general appearance.</p>
                        <p>Q. Have you ever known the lessees to take female skins?—A. No. Any
                            employee killing a female either intentionally or accidentally would be
                            liable to a fine.</p>
                        <p>Q. Did you see any dead pups on the rookeries the past season?—A. Yes; I
                            saw lots of them.</p>

                        <p>Also J. C. Redpath, who, having been duly sworn by me, as hereinafter
                            certified, testified as follows:</p>
                        <p>Q. State your age, place of residence, and occupation.—A. I am 47 years
                            of age, and have been a resident of the seal islands for the past
                            seventeen years; formerly local agent of the Alaska Commercial Company,
                            now of the North American Commercial Company, and during that time have
                            been engaged in the taking of seal.</p>
                        <p>Q. Have you noticed any perceptible difference in the number of seals on
                            the rookeries from one year to another? If so, what changes have you
                            observed?—A. Within the last four or five years I have observed a
                            decided decrease in the number of seals on the rookeries.</p>
                        <p>Q. In what proportion have the seals decreased within the time
                            mentioned?—A. As far as my judgment goes, I should say at least
                            one-half.</p>
                        <p>Q. How do you account for it?—A. By the numbers, principally females,
                            that are killed in the waters by marauders.</p>
                        <p>Q. How do you know that the marauders kill females principally?—A. I know
                            that the females, after giving birth to their young on the rookeries,
                            frequent the open sea in search of food, whereas the males frequent the
                            hauling grounds of waters immediately around it. At various times I have
                            seen skins which were seized by the cutters from the poachers, and they
                            were substantially female skins.</p>
                        <p>Q. Have you noticed any dead pups on the rookeries this past season, and
                            in what proportion to former years?—A. I have seen an unusual number of
                            dead pups this year on the breeding grounds; I may say twice as many as
                            formerly.</p>
                        <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0154"/>
                        <p>Q. How do you account for it?—A. From the fact of their mothers having
                            been killed by marauders. It is a well-known fact that the mothers
                            suckle none but their own pups; consequently the motherless die from
                            want of nourishment.</p>
                        <p>Q. What is the general condition of a healthy pup seal receiving constant
                            attention from its mother?—A. I know him to be completely gorged with
                            milk and his body to be enveloped in fat.</p>
                        <p>Q. What effect, in your opinion, does the increase in the number of
                            poaching vessels in Bering Sea have upon seal life?—A. Since the number
                            of sealing vessels has increased the number of seals coming to the
                            islands has correspondingly decreased.</p>

                        <p>Anton Melovedoff, being duly sworn, deposes and says: I am 38 years of
                            age, and I was born on Kadiak Island, Alaska. I came to St. Paul Island
                            in 1864 the first time and in 1869 the second time. I have resided here
                            since 1869, and I have been constantly employed among the Alaskan fur
                            seals in all that time. I have had a large and varied experience in all
                            the details of the business as it has been carried on on St. Paul
                            Island, and I have done service in all the departments, from the work of
                            a boy to that of first chief of the island. I can read and write the
                            English, Russian, and Aleut languages and I can interpret them into one
                            another. I have read a considerable amount of the controversies on the
                            seal question since the seals began to decrease so rapidly on the
                            rookeries, and I have observed the rookeries and their daily condition
                            since I became first chief in 1884, which office I resigned in 1891.</p>
                        <p>In the Russian times, before 1868, the seals were always driven across
                            the island of St. Paul from North East Point to the village salt house,
                            a distance of 12½ miles; but when the Alaska Commercial Company leased
                            the islands they stopped long driving and built salt houses near to the
                            hauling grounds, so that by 1879 no seals were driven more than 2
                            miles.</p>
                        <p>Noone ever said in those days that seals were made impotent by driving,
                            although long drives had been made for at least fifty years. I have
                            never known or heard tell of a time when there was not bulls enough and
                            to spare on the breeding rookeries. I never saw a cow of 3 years old or
                            over in August without a pup by her side. The only cows on a breeding
                            rookery without pups are the virgin cows who have come there for the
                            first time. I never went on to a rookery in the breeding season when I
                            could not have counted plenty of idle vigorous bulls who had no
                            cows.</p>
                        <p>I have heard it said that the seals are slaughtered indiscriminately on
                            the seal islands, and that the natives take no care of the seals. The
                            contrary of this is true. Rules could hardly be made any more stringent
                            than the rules laid down by the Government and company officers for the
                            care and management of the seals, and no people could be more careful in
                            obeying them in letter and spirit than what ours are.</p>
                        <p>The killing of females is a crime on St. Paul Island, and our church
                            teaches that it is a sin to kill one, and our people know that the death
                            of a cow seal means one pup less for meat in years to come. Never, since
                            I came here in 1869, have I known of a cow to be killed unless by
                            accident, and I think there has not been 10 cows killed out of every
                            85,000 seals killed every year from 1870 to 1889.</p>
                        <p>When I first went on a drive I remember how the chiefs talked to me about
                            being careful of how I went on the hauling grounds; how I must not
                            disturb the breeding rookeries, and that I must walk as slow as I could
                            when driving, and stop and let the seals rest occasionally.</p>
                        <p>I believe the same instructions were given at all times by the chiefs to
                            our people, and I think they have been generally very faithfully obeyed.
                            The bulls and cows being on the breeding rookeries all through June and
                            July, while the killing of the bachelors for skins is taking place,
                            there is no reason why a cow should be driven or killed in the two
                            months named, and it is a very rare case to see a cow on the killing
                            grounds at this time and still rarer to have one killed.</p>
                        <p>After the killing season is ended and the breeding season is over, the
                            cows do mix up with the bachelors on the hauling grounds, and they are
                            often driven when we make a drive of seals to kill for food, and
                            sometimes one or two are clubbed by accident. With this exception there
                            are no cows or females ever killed on the seal islands.</p>
                        <p>I was first chief from 1884 to 1891, all through the years of the
                            decrease and controversy, and it has been my duty to inspect the
                            rookeries and seals from time to time and to report the condition of
                            both to the Government and company agents. <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137"
                                facs="0155"/>It has been my duty to thoroughly inform myself of the
                            number of male seals—bachelors—on each rookery and to select the grounds
                            to be driven from every killing day throughout each killing season, and
                            I believe I never allowed the seals to be overdriven or the drives to be
                            made too often. I remember seeing an occasional, sealing schooner in
                            Bering Sea as long ago as 1878, but it was in 1884 they came in large
                            numbers. At first it was supposed they intended to raid the rookeries,
                            and we armed a number of men and kept guard every night, and we drove
                            off any boats we found coming to a rookery. Sometimes in a dense fog or
                            very dark night they landed and killed a few hundred seals, but the
                            numbers taken in this manner are too small to be considered.</p>
                        <p>About 1886 I noticed that the lines of former years were not filled with
                            cows, and every succeeding year since then has shown a more marked
                            decrease. In 1889 the bachelors were so few on the hauling grounds that
                            the standard weight of skins was lowered to 5 pounds, and hundreds were
                            taken at only 4 pounds in order to fill the quota of 100,000.</p>
                        <p>It was noticed by everyone on the island at this time that as the seals
                            decreased on the rookeries from year to year the number of dead pups
                            increased, until in 1891 the rookeries were covered with them. From 1884
                            the schooners kept on increasing, until in 1891 there was more than one
                            hundred. These schooners care very little about coming to the islands to
                            take seals on the land, for they only have to hover around the fishing
                            banks from 50 to 200 miles away and take all the seals they want. It is
                            to these banks the cow seals go to feed after the birth of their young,
                            and it is here they are shot and killed, and the pups are left to starve
                            and die on the rookeries.</p>
                        <p>Last year I seen thousands of such pups, and I saw many of them opened,
                            and in all cases there was not a sign of food in their stomachs. I never
                            seen a pup that had a mother living to suckle it look poor or sick or
                            starved; nor did I ever see or hear of a sick or diseased seal, although
                            I have eaten the flesh of the fur seal all my life, and it is and has
                            ever been the staple meat ration of our people.</p>
                        <p>Seal meat is cooked at the company house every day while seals are to be
                            had, and it is eaten by all the white men on the island. Men talk of
                            epidemics among seals and of impotent bulls on the rookeries, but those
                            who have spent a lifetime on the seal islands, and whose business and
                            duty it has been to guard and observe them, have no knowledge of the
                            existence of either. An impotent bull dare not attempt to go on a
                            rookery, even had he a desire to do so. Excepting the extremely old and
                            feeble, I have never seen a bull that was impotent.</p>
                        <p>The seals come to the islands every year from the southward, through the
                            passes of the Aleutian Islands; and the bulls reach the islands late in
                            April or early in May, and they continue to haul out till June. They
                            select their stations on the rookeries, and I believe they generally
                            return to the spot they occupied the previous year, and they stay there
                            till August or September without food or water and without much rest or
                            sleep. The cows begin to haul out early in June, and they continue to
                            haul out till about the middle of July, and the pups are born soon after
                            the cows land on, the rookeries. When the pup is born it is utterly
                            helpless and would drown if put into water. Those born nearest the water
                            are often drowned in the surf when the sea is rough in stormy weather.
                            When the pup is a few days old the cow goes into the sea to feed, and as
                            the pup grows older the cow will stay longer and longer, until sometimes
                            she will be away for a week. When the cows return they go to their own
                            pups, nor will a cow suckle any pup but her own. The pups would suck any
                            cow that would let them, for they do not seem to know one cow from
                            another. At 7 or 8 weeks old the pups learn to swim by first paddling in
                            the shallow water, but after learning to swim they appear to prefer to
                            stay on land until the cold weather drives them off in November.</p>
                        <p>Until 1891 we were allowed to kill several thousand pup seals for food in
                            November, about the time they were ready to leave the island. We
                            generally killed ten or twelve for every person on the island, and when
                            we killed them they were always found to be full of milk.</p>
                        <p>The bachelors commence to haul out in May, and they haul out to late in
                            July, the older ones coming early and the younger ones later, and I have
                            found that the seals killed in May and early June were fat, and that
                            their stomachs were full of food, principally codfish, and that later in
                            the season they were poor and had nothing in their stomachs. My opinion,
                            therefore, is that none but the mother seals go out in the sea to eat
                            during the time the herds are on the islands, and this accounts for the
                            great number of cows shot by the sealing schooners in Bering Sea during
                            July, August, and September. I was visiting in San Francisco in the
                            winter of 1890–91, and I worked in a fur store during several months of
                            my stay there, and I was called on to handle and inspect thousands of
                            the skins taken by schooners in Bering Sea, and they were nearly all
                            cow-seal skins.</p>
                        <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0156"/>
                        <p>I know of no other explanation than this: The cows are shot and killed
                            when they go into the sea to feed, and the pups die on the rookeries.
                            This, I think, is the true solution of the vexed question, “What has
                            become of the seals?” When the season ends and the compact family
                            organization breaks up, the bulls begin to leave the islands, going,
                            away slowly through September and early October before they are all
                            gone.</p>
                        <p>The bachelors, cows, and pups go in November, the older bachelors leaving
                            late in October and the pups in November. Sometimes in good, mild
                            weather bachelors are found and killed for food late in January.</p>
                        <p>The movements of the seals are governed quite considerably by the
                            weather. When they do leave the island they go southward and pass once
                            more through the passes of the Aleutian Islands and out into the North
                            Pacific Ocean.</p>
                        <p>It is usually supposed that seals are like wild animals. This is not so.
                            They are used to the natives and will not run far from them. The little
                            pups will come to them, and even in the fall, when they are older, we
                            can take them up in our hands and see whether they are males or females.
                            We can drive the seals about in little or large bands just as we want
                            them to go, and they are easy to manage. We protect and take good care
                            of the seals, and if they were not killed in the sea we could make them
                            increase upon the islands so that they would be as many as before.</p>

                        <p>J. C. Redpath, being duly sworn, deposes and says: I am an American
                            citizen, a native of Connecticut, and I am 48 years of age. At present I
                            am a resident of St. Paul Island, Alaska. I have resided on the seal
                            islands of St. George and St. Paul since my first coming to Alaska in
                            1875. My present occupation is that of local agent on St. Paul Island
                            for the present lessees, the North American Commercial Company. I have a
                            practical knowledge of and am thoroughly conversant with the habits and
                            conditions of the fur seal as it exists on the Pribilof Islands of St.
                            George and St. Paul, and also of the methods adopted and practiced in
                            the taking of the skins, and of the several efforts made by the former
                            and present lessees, as experience taught them, to increase the herd and
                            to build up the rookeries and perpetuate seal life. I have had a
                            personal experience of seventeen seasons on the killing grounds in
                            different situations, from that of seal clubber to foreman, several
                            years of which I have been the resident local agent. My position as
                            local agent has led me to make a careful study of the seal question, and
                            it is my duty to report, from time to time, to the general agent of the
                            lessees the result of my observations.</p>
                        <p>The Alaskan fur seal is a native of the Pribilof Islands, and, unless
                            prevented, will return to those islands every year with the regularity
                            of the seasons. All the peculiarities of nature that surround the
                            Pribilof group of islands, such as low and even temperature, fog, mist,
                            and perpetually clouded sky, seem to indicate their fitness and
                            adaptability as a home for the Alaskan fur seal; and with an instinct
                            bordering on reason they have selected these lonely and barren islands
                            as the choicest spots of earth upon which to assemble and dwell together
                            during their six months’ stay on land; and annually they journey across
                            thousands of miles of ocean and pass hundreds of islands, without pause
                            or rest, until they come to the place of their birth. And it is a
                            well-established fact that upon no other land in the world do the
                            Alaskan fur seal haul out of water.</p>
                        <p>Early in May the bulls approach the islands, and, after cautiously and
                            carefully reconnoitering the surroundings, haul out and select their
                            stations on the rookeries, where they patiently await the coming of the
                            cows. When they first appear upon the rookeries the bulls are fat and
                            sleek and very aggressive, but after a stay of from three to four months
                            without food they crawl away from the rookeries in a very lean
                            condition. In my opinion the bull seal returns to the spot he occupied
                            the preceding <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0157"/>years, and I know
                            of several instances, where he could be distinguished by the loss of an
                            eye or a nipper, in which he actually did return for a series of years
                            to the same spot.</p>
                        <p>The mother seals or cows commence to haul out about June 10, and nearly
                            all of them are on the rookeries by July 15, and I believe they bring
                            forth their young almost immediately after reaching their places on the
                            rookeries. When the pup is from four to six days old the mother goes
                            into the water for food, and as time passes her stay becomes longer,
                            until finally she will be away from her pup for several days at a time
                            and sometimes for a whole week. During these longer migrations she often
                            goes 200 miles from the rookery, and I have been informed by men who
                            were engaged in the trade of pelagic hunting that they had taken
                            “mothers in milk” at a distance of over 200 miles from the Seal
                            Islands.</p>
                        <p>No cow will nurse any pup but her own, and I have often watched the pups
                            attempt to suck cows, but they were always driven off; and this fact
                            convinces me that the cow recognizes her own pup and that the pup does
                            not know its dam. At birth and for several weeks after the pup is
                            utterly helpless and entirely dependent on its dam for sustenance, and
                            should anything prevent her return during this period it dies on the
                            rookery. This has been demonstrated beyond a doubt since the sealing
                            vessels have operated largely in Bering Sea during the months of July,
                            August, and September, and which, killing the cows at the feeding
                            grounds, left the pups to die on the islands.</p>
                        <p>At about five weeks old the pups begin to run about and congregate in
                            bunches or “pods,” and at six to eight weeks old they go into the
                            shallow water and gradually learn to swim.</p>
                        <p>They are not amphibious when born, nor can they swim for several weeks
                            thereafter, and were they put into the water would perish beyond a
                            doubt, as has been well established by the drowning of pups caught by
                            the surf in stormy weather. After learning to swim the pups still draw
                            their sustenance from the cows, and I have noticed at the annual killing
                            of pups for food in November that their stomachs were always full of
                            milk and nothing else, although the cows had left the island some days
                            before. I have no knowledge of the pups obtaining sustenance of any kind
                            except that furnished by the cows, nor have I ever seen anything but
                            milk in a dead pup’s stomach. The young males, from two to five years
                            old, whose skins are taken by the lessees, begin to haul out on land in
                            May and they continue to haul out till July. They herd by themselves
                            during the months of May, June, and July, and they do this because,
                            during the breeding season, they dare not approach the breeding
                            rookeries or the bulls would destroy them. Being thus debarred from a
                            position on the breeding rookeries or from intermingling with the cows,
                            they herd together on the hauling grounds, where they are easily
                            approached and surrounded by the natives, who drive them to the killing
                            grounds without disturbing the breeding rookeries.</p>
                        <p>Young males killed in May and June, when examined, are found to be in
                            prime condition, and their stomachs are filled with fish—principally
                            codfish—but those killed later in the season are found to be poor and
                            lean and their stomachs empty, which shows that the males rarely leave
                            the islands for food during the summer months.</p>
                        <p>Statute law forbids the killing of the female seal, and nature regulates
                            the matter so that there is no danger of their being driven or killed
                            during the regular killing season, which takes place in June and July,
                            when all the “killing for skins” is done, and after all my experience
                            here I am free to say that a small fraction of 1 per cent would
                            represent all the females killed on the islands since they became the
                            property of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The compact family arrangement so tenaciously adhered to during the
                            breeding season becomes relaxed in August, and the females scatter, and
                            a few of them mix up with the young males, and when the natives make a
                            drive for food it occasionally happens that a female will accompany the
                            males, and sometimes one or two may be accidentally killed. I use the
                            word “accidentally” advisedly, because there is no good reason why the
                            natives or the lessees should kill a female seal designedly, as the skin
                            is of no more use or value (if so much) nor its flesh as good for food
                            as is that of the male; and, excepting accidents, it is a fact that no
                            female seals are or ever were killed on the Pribilof Islands since
                            American rules and regulations were established there.</p>
                        <p>The regular killing season for skins under the lease begins on June 1 and
                            ends practically on the last of July, and during this period the
                            first-class Alaskan fur-seal skins are taken. The seals are driven from
                            the hauling to the killing grounds by experienced natives under the
                            orders of the native chief, and the constant aim and object of all
                            concerned is to exercise the greatest care in driving, so that the
                            animals may not be injured or abused in any manner.</p>

                        <p>As the regulations require the lessees to pay for every skin taken from
                            seals killed by the orders of their local agents, and as the skin of an
                            over-heated seal is valueless, it is only reasonable to suppose that
                            they would be the last men living to encourage or to allow their
                            employees to overdrive or in any manner injure the seals. I know that
                            the orders given to me, as local agent, were always the most positive
                            and emphatic kind on this point, and they were always obeyed to the
                            letter. Instead of overdriving or neglecting the seals the lessees have
                            endeavored to do everything in their power to shorten the distances
                            between the hauling and killing grounds, or between the hauling grounds
                            and the salt house.</p>
                        <p>Before the Alaska Commercial Company leased the Seal Islands in 1870, it
                            was a common practice to drive seals from North East Point to the
                            village on St. Paul Island, a distance of 12 miles, and from Zapadnie to
                            the village on St. George Island, a distance of 6 miles, across a very
                            rough and rugged country.</p>
                        <p>From Halfway Point and from Zapadnie, on St. Paul Island, seals were
                            driven, respectively, 5 and 6 miles.</p>
                        <p>When the Alaska Commercial Company took control of the islands the drive
                            from North East Point was prohibited and a salt house and other
                            necessary buildings erected within 2 miles of the killing ground, and
                            all the skins taken there were salted and stored and shipped from North
                            East Point. In 1879 a killing ground was made, and a salt house built at
                            Halfway Point, within 2 miles of the hauling grounds, and all skins
                            taken at the point are salted there. At Zapadnie, the same year, a
                            killing ground was made within a mile of the hauling ground, and the
                            skins taken there are taken to the village salt houses in boats, or,
                            when the weather is unfavorable, by team and wagon.,</p>
                        <p>Since 1878 there has not been a drive made on St. Paul Island to exceed 2
                            miles. At Zapadnie, St. George, a salt house was built about 1875 and
                            the 6-mile drive prohibited, and a trail made at great expense across
                            the island, over which the skins are taken on pack saddles to the
                            village. Since 1874 no seals have been driven on St. George Island to
                            exceed 2½ miles.</p>
                        <p>Although the seals are comparatively tame after being on the land for a
                            short time and do not get scared so easily as is commonly supposed, the
                            rules and regulations of the Treasury Department are very strict on the
                            question of absolute protection to the seals on the islands, and the
                            Treasury agents have always most rigidly enforced them.</p>
                        <p>It is unlawful to fire a gun on the islands from the time the first seal
                            appears in the spring until the last one leaves at the end of the
                            season; and in order to properly enforce this law the firearms are taken
                            from the natives and locked up in the Government house, in care of the
                            Treasury agents.</p>
                        <p>No person is allowed to go near a rookery unless by special order of the
                            Treasury agent; and, when driving from the hauling grounds, the natives
                            are forbidden to smoke or make any unusual noise or to do anything that
                            might disturb or frighten the seals. All driving is done when the
                            weather is cool and moist, and when the condition of the weather demands
                            it the drives are made in the cool of the night, and in no case are
                            seals driven at a higher rate of speed than about half a mile an hour.
                            So carefully is the driving done that it has been found necessary to
                            divide the native drivers into several “watches” which relieve each
                            other on the road, because, the pace being so slow, the men get
                            cold.</p>
                        <p>From 1875 to 1883 it was no uncommon thing for the lessees to take the
                            annual quota of 100,000 skins between June 1 and July 20, and yet there
                            was no sign of any decrease, but rather an expansion of most of the
                            rookeries.</p>
                        <p>I do not pretend to be able to say how many seals there are, or ever
                            were, on the rookeries; nor do I believe anybody else can tell, for the
                            rookeries are so broken and filled with rocks it is impossible to
                            estimate the number of seals upon them with any approach to accuracy.
                            The lines of expansion and contraction are plain enough, and can be seen
                            and understood by the whole community.</p>
                        <p>Until 1884 sealing schooners were seen but very seldom near the islands
                            or in Bering Sea, and the few seals taken by the hunters who raided the
                            rookeries occasionally are too paltry to be seriously considered,
                            because the raids were so few and the facilities for taking many seals
                            off so utterly insignificant. In 1884 the sealing schooners became
                            numerous. I believe there were about 30 in the sea that year, and they
                            have increased very rapidly every year since, until now they are said to
                            be about 120. As the schooners increased the seals decreased, and the
                            lines of contraction on the rookeries were noticed to draw nearer and
                            nearer to the beach, and the killable seals became fewer in number and
                            harder to find. In 1886 the decrease was so plain that the natives and
                            all the agents on the islands saw it and were startled, and theories of
                            all sorts were advanced in an attempt to account for a cause.</p>
                        <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0159"/>
                        <p>A dearth of bulls on the breeding rookeries was a pet theory of one or
                            two transient visitors, but it only needed a thorough investigation of
                            the condition of the rookeries to convince the most skeptical that there
                            were plenty of bulls, and to spare, and that hardly a cow could be found
                            on the rookeries without a pup at her side.</p>
                        <p>For five years I have given this particular subject my most earnest
                            attention, and every succeeding year’s experience has convinced me that
                            there is not, and never was, a dearth of bulls. The theory of impotency
                            of the young bulls because of overdriving when young is not worthy of
                            consideration by any sane or honest man who has ever seen a bull seal on
                            a breeding rookery; and as I have already answered the question of
                            overdriving, I will only add here that no young bull ever goes upon a
                            breeding rookery until he is able to fight his way in, and an impotent
                            bull has no desire to fight, nor could he win a position on the rookery
                            were he to attempt it. The man is not alive who ever saw a 6 or 7 year
                            old bull seal impotent.</p>
                        <p>Another theory, equally untrue, was that an epidemic had seized the herd;
                            but investigations of the closest kind have never revealed the death, on
                            the islands, of a full-grown seal from unknown causes. Let it be
                            remembered that the flesh of the seal is the staple diet of the natives
                            and that it is eaten daily by most of the white employees as well; and
                            yet it is true that a sign of taint or disease has never been found on a
                            seal carcass in the memory of man. It was not until so many thousands of
                            dead pups were found upon the rookeries that the problem was solved.</p>
                        <p>The truth is that when the cows go out to the feeding grounds to feed
                            they are shot and killed by the pelagic hunter, and the pups, deprived
                            of sustenance, die upon the rookeries. Excepting a few pups killed by
                            the surf occasionally, it has been demonstrated that all the pups found
                            dead are poor and starved, and when examined their stomachs are found to
                            be without a sign of food of any sort. In 1891 the rookeries on St. Paul
                            Island were covered, in places, with dead pups, all of which had every
                            symptom of having died of hunger, and on opening several of them the
                            stomachs were found to be empty.</p>
                        <p>The resident physician, Dr. Ackerly, examined many of them and found in
                            every instance that starvation was the cause of death. The lowest
                            estimates made at the time, placing the number of dead pups on the
                            rookeries at 25,000, is too high.</p>
                        <p>It has been said that man can do nothing to facilitate the propagation of
                            the fur seal. My experience does not support this. The reservation of
                            females and the killing of the surplus males, so that each bull can have
                            a reasonable number of cows, is more advantage to the growth of the
                            rookeries than when in a state of nature bulls killed each other in
                            their efforts to secure a single cow.</p>
                        <p>The same care can be and is exercised in the handling and management of
                            the seal herd as is bestowed by a ranchman upon his bands of ranging
                            stock, and is productive of like results. The seals have become so
                            accustomed to the natives that the presence of the latter does not
                            disturb them. The pups are easily handled by the natives, and formerly,
                            when used as an article of food, thousands of pups were actually picked
                            up and examined, in accordance with Government requirement, to avoid the
                            killing of a female. So easily are the seals controlled that when a
                            drive of “bachelors” is made to the killing grounds a guard of two or
                            three small boys is sufficient to keep them from straying, and from the
                            general band any number from one upward can be readily cut out. It is
                            possible in the future, as it has been in the past, to reserve
                            unmolested suitable areas to serve as breeding grounds; to set aside
                            each year a proper number of young males for future service upon the
                            rookeries, and by the application of the ordinary stock-breeding
                            principles not only to perpetuate but to rapidly increase the seal
                            herd.</p>
                        <p>To one who has spent so many years among the seals as I have, and who has
                            taken so much interest in them, it does appear to be wrong that they
                            should be allowed to be so ruthlessly and indiscriminatety slaughtered
                            by pelagic hunters, who secure only about one-fourth of all they kill.
                            There is no doubt in my mind that unless immediate protection be given
                            to the Alaskan fur seal the species will be practically destroyed in a
                            very few years, and in order to protect them pelagic hunting must be
                            absolutely prohibited.</p>
                        <p>N. B.—The foregoing is substantially the same testimony that I gave to
                            the Commissioners who visited the islands in 1891.</p>

                        <p>W. B. Taylor, of Omaha, Nebr., being duly sworn, deposes and says: I am
                            41 years of age, secretary and treasurer of the Globe Loan and Trust
                            Company, of Omaha, Nebr., and am not and never have been in any way
                            connected with any company engaged in the seal-skin industry. In the
                            year 1881 I was assistant treasury agent for the Seal Islands. I arrived
                            on the islands in the latter part of May of that year, and after a
                            week’s stay on St. Paul Island was detailed to St. George, remaining
                            there until the latter part of August. Since then I have not been on the
                            islands. While on St. George I was on the killing grounds every day
                            during the season and visited the rookeries almost daily, both in
                            connection with my official duties and for the purpose of studying seal
                            life. From carefully observing the grounds formerly occupied by breeding
                            seals, as pointed out to me by the natives, and from statements made me
                            by those on the island, I believe there were more seals on the islands
                            in 1881 than in any year previous to that time. I believe that the
                            increase and decrease of seal life can be certainly told from accurate
                            measurements of the breeding grounds, because the seals herd together as
                            closely as possible, whether there are few or many of them. But the
                            number of seals can not be estimated with even approximate accuracy,
                            because of the roughness and unevenness of the ground, and because
                            during the height of the season a majority of the females (called cows)
                            are out at sea feeding, being often obliged to go 30 or more miles from
                            the islands for this purpose, and not returning till late at night. I
                            think the number of seals heretofore estimated has been largely
                            exaggerated, and no dependence can be placed on any estimate as to their
                            number.</p>
                        <p>During the year I was on the island of St. George I did not see to exceed
                            25 dead pups on the rookeries, and the bodies of these were not
                            emaciated, but had evidently been killed by the old bulls climbing over
                            them in their combats. From my observations I am convinced a pup must be
                            six or eight weeks old before it can swim, and that a female generally
                            teaches her own pup the use of his flippers. Birth in the water would
                            mean immediate death to the pup, both because of the fact last stated
                            and from the further fact that for a day or two after birth a pup is
                            entirely helpless. In my judgment, then, a seal pup for the first few
                            weeks of its life is a land quadruped, and in no sense an amphibian. I
                            believe that a seal is naturally a land animal, as all copulation,
                            birth, and nursing takes place on shore; and the only reason I think the
                            seals seek the water is because they are compelled so to do in order to
                            obtain food. This is verified from the fact that the seals remain on
                            land as long as possible until the need of food and severity of the
                            weather compel them to take to the sea. A female when she returns from
                            the feeding grounds will always select her own pup from all those on the
                            rookeries, and will give suck to no other. It is therefore my opinion
                            that if a mother seal is killed the pup will certainly die of
                            starvation.</p>
                        <p>I made a very particular examination and study of the methods employed by
                            the natives in driving and killing the young males or bachelors, and, in
                            my opinion, these methods are the very best that could be adopted, and I
                            can conceive of no other way which could be employed and preserve seal
                            life so effectually. In starting to drive, the bachelors are driven from
                            the hauling grounds, which are separated from the breeding grounds.
                            Great care was always taken not to disturb the breeders; no one was ever
                            allowed to go on the breeding grounds during the rutting season, all
                            observations as to the habits being made from overhanging cliffs or some
                            elevation in the vicinity of the harems. I never saw but one female
                            killed out of the 20,000 taken on St. George Island in 1881, and that
                            was accidental. A drive is always made between 2 and 6 o’clock in the
                            morning, when the weather is cool and there is less liability of
                            overheating the seals. Seals are driven as slowly as possible, and still
                            keep them in motion. I do not think that there were 50 seals killed
                            during the season by overheating and smothering, and in all cases the
                            skins of these were taken and counted with the other skins transported
                            to the salt houses. I never saw or heard of the generative organs of a
                            male seal being injured by redriving, and it seems to me to be utterly
                            absurd that anyone could think that an animal with such wonderful
                            vitality as is possessed by the male seal could be injured or his
                            reproductive powers impaired by driving or redriving. If such a thing
                            should occur it would be at once noticeable, for the impotent bull would
                            certainly haul up with the bachelors, having no inclination and vigor to
                            maintain himself on the rookeries.</p>
                        <p>It is my opinion that a bull is able to serve from 3 to 5 cows a day, and
                            certainly over 100 in a season. I have seen over 40 cows at one time in
                            a harem, and the bull <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0161"/>who
                            possessed this harem was continually striving to obtain more cows. There
                            was but one raid on the rookeries while I was there, and that took place
                            on Otter Island, about 60 skins being taken. After that raid the
                            Government kept a man on Otter Island during the entire summer to
                            protect it from marauders. Raids on the islands never affected seal life
                            to any extent. Since my residence on the Pribilof Islands I have kept a
                            very careful watch of the progress of events there, and have interviewed
                            a great many connected with the seal industry. I am of the conviction
                            that the reported decrease in seal life on these islands can be
                            attributed to no other cause save pelagic sealing. While I was located
                            at St. George Island in 1881 pelagic sealing was then, and previous to
                            that time had been, of very little consequence, having very slight
                            effect upon seal life. Not more than 4 or 5 vessels were engaged in
                            pelagic sealing in 1881 in the waters of Bering Sea, and prior to that
                            time a still fewer number were so engaged. But since 1881 this industry
                            has grown yearly, until now about 100 vessels are destroying the seals
                            in great numbers, and, as I am informed and believe, the great majority
                            of those killed are females. Then, too, large numbers are killed in this
                            way which are never recovered or reported. It is therefore, in my
                            opinion, necessary that the seals should be protected, and all killing
                            in the water prohibited in all waters which the seal herd frequents, and
                            especially in Bering Sea and while the herd are en route to and from the
                            islands through the Aleutian passes.</p>

                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I examined the skins taken from sealing vessels seized in 1887 and 1889,
                            over 12,000 skins, and of these at least two-thirds or three-fourths
                            were the skins of females. Of the females taken in the Pacific Ocean and
                            early in the season in Bering Sea nearly all are heavy with young, and
                            the death of the female necessarily causes the death of the unborn pup
                            seal; in fact, I have seen on nearly every vessel seized the pelts of
                            unborn pups which had been taken from their mothers. Of the females
                            taken in Bering Sea nearly all are in milk, and I have seen the milk
                            come from the carcasses of dead females lying on the decks of sealing
                            vessels which were more than 100 miles from the Pribilof Islands. From
                            this fact and from the further fact that I have seen seals in the water
                            over 150 miles from the islands during the summer, I am convinced that
                            the female, after giving birth to her young on the rookeries, goes at
                            least 150 miles, in many cases, from the islands in search of food. It
                            is impossible to distinguish a male from a female seal in the water,
                            except in the case of a very old bull, when his size distinguishes him.
                            Therefore, open-sea sealing is entirely indiscriminate as to sex or age.
                            I consider it necessary for the preservation of the seal herd which
                            resorts to the Pribilof Islands, and for the prevention of their early
                            extermination, that pelagic sealing should cease in all waters which
                            they frequent.</p>
                        <p>I do not know and I never heard of any other place along the American
                            coast or islands where the fur seals haul up, and it is my opinion that
                            the fur-seal pup of the Alaskan hero is born nowhere else but on the
                            Pribilof Islands. It is my belief that a pup born in the water would
                            drown, for I am convinced, from statements made me by the natives and
                            those thoroughly familiar with seal habits, that a pup for the first
                            weeks of its life is unable to swim. It is my opinion that should
                            pelagic sealing be prohibited in a zone 30, 40, or 50 miles about the
                            Pribilof Islands it would be utterly useless as a protection to seal
                            life, because female seals go much farther than that in search of food,
                            and because fogs are so prevalent about those islands that it would be
                            impossible to enforce any such prohibition.</p>

                            been engaged in catching seal three seasons. Last season I commanded the
                            sealing schooner <hi rend="italic">Sitka</hi>, of Sitka. Took seal along
                            the coast as far as Yakutat. First seal were seen and caught last year
                            off Sitka Sound and last year off Salisbury Sound in April and May. The
                            seal are working to westward all the time. Have always used a shotgun to
                            take seal. About 60 per cent of the seal shot with shotgun are lost. A
                            much larger per cent are lost when rifle is used. The seals taken by me
                            have been females mostly with pup. Have never killed a bull in my life.
                            A few yearlings are taken, all of which are females. The sex of the seal
                            can not be told in the water. Hunters use no discrimination, and
                            everything in the shape of a seal that comes near the boat is killed.
                            When seal are asleep lying with their heads on the water and are killed,
                            they most always float, but if shot as they put their heads out of water
                            they sink almost immediately. Always shoot a seal in the head when it is
                            possible to do so.</p>
                        <p>Never heard of nor seen pups born in the water or on the coast of Alaska
                            outside of Pribilof Islands. Have never seen or heard of seals hauling
                            up on the coast elsewhere than on the Pribilof Islands. They very seldom
                            come nearer this coast than 20 miles when advancing north toward Bering
                            Sea. I think if sealing was stopped in Bering Sea that seal would become
                            more plentiful along the coast, and if it is not stopped the herd will
                            soon be destroyed.</p>

                        <p>Niels Bonde, being duly sworn, deposes and says: I am 24 years of age;
                            residence, Victoria, British Columbia; occupation, seaman. I went
                            sealing as deck hand in the British schooner <hi rend="italic"
                            >Kate</hi>, Captain Moss, master, in 1887. We had twenty canoes and
                            Indian hunters who used spears, except in calm weather, when they would
                            use shotguns. We sailed from Victoria the 15th of March, sealing off
                            Barclay Sound, between there and Cape Cook, and caught 522 seals. Came
                            back to Victoria in May, discharged our skins, and then went to Bering
                            Sea, arriving there in July. We came out of the Bering Sea the latter
                            part of August, and had caught about 1,700 seals between the Pribilof
                            Islands and Unalaska; we caught them from 10 to 100 or more miles off
                            St. George Island. The largest catch we had that year in any one day was
                            266 seals. We only took 8 canoes and 1 boat into Bering Sea.</p>
                        <p>In 1888 I left Victoria on the 11th of April as mate and interpreter on
                            the British schooner <hi rend="italic">Arannah</hi>, H. F. Siewart,
                            master, and carried 16 canoes while sealing on the coast, and Indian
                            hunters with spears, but in calm weather they used shotguns. We caught
                            about 100 seals on the coast, and then in the latter part of May left
                            for the Commander Islands, on the Russian side of the Bering Sea, and
                            was seized on the 1st of July by the Russian authorities.</p>
                        <p>I left Victoria on the 28th of May, 1889, in the British schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">Kate</hi>, as deck hand, with 10 canoes and Indian
                            hunters with spears and shotguns. The Indians used spears chiefly. We
                            went directly to the Shumagin Island, where we took in water and
                            provisions, and went into Bering Sea through Unamak Pass, and sealed in
                            those waters till some time in August, when we were ordered out by the
                            revenue cutter and went to Victoria. We caught a little over 800 seals
                            in the Bering Sea that year.</p>
                        <p>In 1890 I left Victoria on the 17th of January in the British schooner
                                <hi rend="italic">Pioneer</hi>, Morgan, master. I shipped as a deck
                            hand. We had 5 boats and white hunters, who used shotguns and rifles. We
                            commenced sealing off the California coast, near Cape Blanco, and worked
                            our way up the coast to Barclay Sound, and caught about 400 seals and
                            put them aboard another vessel and then sealed along the coast to Bering
                            Sea, and caught on our way up and in the sea about 1,600 more, and left
                            Bering Sea for Victoria the latter part of August.</p>
                        <p>The seals caught along the coast after the 1st of April are mostly
                            pregnant females, and those caught in Bering Sea were females that had
                            given birth to their young. I often noticed the milk flowing out of
                            their breasts when being skinned, and have seen them killed more than
                            100 miles from the Seal Islands. I have seen live pups cut out of their
                            mothers and live around on the decks for a week. On the <hi
                                rend="italic">Pioneer</hi> we had a couple of good hunters who would
                            get almost all they shot at, while some of our hunters would lose a good
                            many that they would kill and wound. A green hunter will not get more
                            than 1 out of 5, and I have known one hunter on our vessel who shot 80
                            shots and got only 4 seals. Indian hunters that use spears seldom lose
                            any that are struck, and there is no wounded to go away and die. I can
                            not say positively as to the decrease in numbers, but I know they are
                            much more shy now than when I commenced sealing.</p>
                        <p>I know of no place where seals haul up on the coast, nor do I believe
                            there is any.</p>

                        <p>Henry Brown, being duly sworn, deposes and says: I am 42 years of age,
                            and reside in Victoria, British Columbia. I am by occupation a seaman.
                            On or about February 21, 1890, I shipped as an able seaman, but did
                            service as a boat steerer on the sealing schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >Minnie</hi>, which cleared from Victoria. She carried 12 canoes and
                            a stern boat. Each canoe was manned by two Indians, who used spears
                            principally. The stern boat was manned by white men, who used rifles and
                            shotguns, principally shotguns. <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0164"
                            />I acted as steererman in the stern boat. We hunted seals all along the
                            coast from Grays Harbor to the passes leading into Bering Sea. The first
                            seals seen were about 30 miles south and west of Cape Flattery. We then
                            followed the herd northward, capturing about 1,000 seals on the coast,
                            which we transferred to the American steam schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >Mischief</hi> at sea, about 15 miles from Sand Point. We then
                            proceeded to the Bering Sea, entering through the Unamak Pass about the
                            middle of July. We captured over 1,200 seals all the way from 24 to 100
                            miles away from the Pribilof Islands. We then returned to Sand Point,
                            and arrived back at Victoria about the last of November.</p>
                        <p>On January 19, 1891, I shipped at Victoria as an able seaman, and took
                            the boatsteerer’s billet on the sealing schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >Mascot</hi>, Lawrence, master. She carried 1 stern boat and 10
                            canoes. The canoes were manned by Indians, who used spears in hunting
                            the seals, and the stern boat, in which I was steerer, was manned by 3
                            white men. The hunter used a shotgun. We sealed all along the coast from
                            Cape Flattery up to Cape Cook, on Vancouver Island, and captured 9
                            seals. The only one taken by the stern boat was a female with a pup in
                            her. The pup was thrown into the ocean. On the 22d of May we arrived
                            back in Victoria.</p>
                        <p>On the 25th of February, 1892, I shipped at Victoria, British Columbia,
                            on the sealing schooner <hi rend="italic">May Belle</hi>, Smith, master.
                            I shipped as an able seaman, and did service in the stern boat as boat
                            steerer. She also carried 10 canoes, each being manned by 2 Indians, who
                            used the spear in hunting. We sealed along the coast from Destruction
                            Island as far north as Triangle Island, off the Vancouver shore, and
                            captured but one female seal. On the 18th of April I left the <hi
                                rend="italic">May Belle</hi> at Clayaquot Sound and returned to
                            Victoria on the 5th of May on the steam schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >Maud.</hi></p>
                        <p>The seal captured by us along the coast in 1890 were all gravid females.
                            I do not know the sex of those taken by our Indians on the coast in that
                            year. We did not capture any gravid seals in the Bering Sea. Nearly all
                            the seals taken in Bering Sea were cows in milk. We captured a few young
                            seals in the sea of both sexes.</p>
                        <p>In 1890 our hunter in the stern boat secured 60 seals, and lost over 200
                            seals that he wounded. The Indians make a sure work of it, and secure
                            nearly every seal that they spear. They do not make so much noise in
                            approaching a sleeping seal as the white hunters do. When an Indian in a
                            canoe is approaching a bunch of seals asleep on the water he does not
                            remove his paddle from the water, but dexterously and noiselessly moves
                            it in the water, because the least sound would awaken the seals. The
                            hunter who uses a gun not only disturbs the seal he shoots, but awakens
                            and disturbs the others, who then make their escape.</p>
                        <p>In 1891 I noticed that there was a considerable decrease in the number of
                            seals seen in the water; also that they were more shy and wakeful as
                            compared with my observations in 1890. A cow seal that’s heavy with pup
                            is sluggish and sleeps more soundly than the males, and for that reason
                            they are more readily approached. I have never known a black pup to be
                            captured on the coast. Seals do not haul out upon the land along the
                            coast, nor give birth to their young on the kelp or in the water. I have
                            never heard the Indians or white sealers say there is a place on the
                            coast where seals haul out and breed. A great many seals that are shot
                            would sink before we could secure them. Sometimes the water above the
                            sinking seal would be so discolored by the blood that it was impossible
                            to see it and secure it with the gaffhook, which all sealing boats carry
                            for that purpose. If pelagic sealing is continued, especially with guns,
                            in a few years the seal herd will become commercially destroyed. Nearly
                            every seal captured causes the death of either an unborn pup or the
                            death of a young pup by starvation on the islands. All pelagic sealing
                            should be prohibited after April 1 of each year until such time as the
                            young pups are able to subsist without nourishment from their mothers.
                            It is practically impossible to distinguish the age or sex of seals in
                            the water while approaching them while at a reasonable gunshot distance
                            from them excepting in the case of old bulls. Old bulls and male seals
                            appear to enter Bering Sea before the cows leave the coast. Our last
                            catch of seals on the coast were almost exclusively gravid females.</p>

                        <p>Thomas Brown, being duly sworn, deposes and says: My age is 31 years; my
                            residence is Victoria, British Columbia; occupation, seaman. I went
                            sealing in 1889 from San Francisco, Cal. (I do not remember the name of
                            the vessel); Captain Scott was master. We sealed as far south as San
                            Diego, Cal., then went along the coast to Farallone Islands, opposite
                            San Francisco. We had 5 boats, 3 men to each boat, and 1 stern boat, all
                            white men; we used shotguns and rifles; the seals were very plentiful
                            that year; most all the seals that we shot and secured were females and
                            had young pups in them, and we would sometimes skin them. If we didn’t
                            get to a seal soon after it was shot it would sink, and we lost a great
                            many; probably got about 1 out of 5 of all the seals shot. We sealed as
                            far as Queen Charlotte Islands, and got about 195 seals in the two
                            months’ sealing. We did not enter Bering Sea that year.</p>
                        <p>In 1890 I went sealing again in the schooner <hi rend="italic">Sea
                                Lion</hi>, Madison, master; had 5 boats, and 3 men to each boat; I
                            was boat puller; we were sealing about three months and got about 400
                            seals, most all females. This year the seals were wilder than the year
                            before; I think it was because they were being hunted so much. We did
                            not capture as many in proportion to the number shot as we did the year
                            previous, and did not save more than 1 out of 6 that we shot. We did not
                            enter Bering Sea and returned to Victoria in April. Our catch was fully
                            80 per cent females. I do not think that seals give birth to their young
                            on the kelp.</p>
                        <p>In 1891, in the month of February, I sailed from Victoria, British
                            Columbia, on the schooner <hi rend="italic">Thistle</hi>, Nicherson,
                            master, on a sealing voyage. We had 17 boats, and 3 men to each boat,
                            all white men. I signed as boat puller. Commenced sealing off Cape
                            Flattery, and all the seals which we caught were pregnant females. I did
                            not see as many seals as the years previous; I left the vessel in April
                            at Victoria, British Columbia. The seals upon this voyage were more shy
                            than in 1889, and more difficult to capture. During the trip of 1891 I
                            don’t think we got more than 1 seal out of 6 that we killed; many were
                            wounded, and others were shot dead and sank before the boat could get to
                            them. The seals are decreasing in number rapidly, and in order to
                            prevent the extermination of seals, the hunting of them should be
                            prohibited until after the mother seals give birth to their young.
                            Sealers should be notified of a closed season before they go to the
                            expense of fitting out.</p>

                        <p>Alfred Dardean, being duly sworn, deposes and says: I reside at Victoria,
                            British Columbia. My occupation for the last two years has been that of
                            a seaman. I went sealing in the schooner <hi rend="italic">Mollie
                                Adams</hi> (afterwards changed to <hi rend="italic">E. B.
                                Marvin</hi>) as boat puller. We left Victoria, British Columbia, on
                            the 27th of May, 1890, and commenced sealing up the coast toward Bering
                            Sea; entered Bering Sea through the Unamak Pass about July 7 and sealed
                            around the eastern part of Bering Sea until late in the fall. We caught
                            over 900 skins before entering the sea and our whole catch that year was
                            2,159 skins. Of the seals that were caught off the coast fully 90 out of
                            every 100 had young pups in them. The boats would bring the seals killed
                            on board the vessel and we would take the young pups out and skin them.
                            If the pup is a good, nice one, we would skin it and keep it for
                            ourselves. I had 8 such skins myself. Four out of 5, if caught in May or
                            June, would be alive when we cut them out of the mothers. One of them we
                            kept for pretty near three weeks alive on deck by feeding it on
                            condensed milk. One of the men finally killed it because it cried so
                            pitifully. We only got 3 seals with pups in them in the Bering Sea. Most
                            all of them were females that had given birth to their young on the
                            islands, and the milk would run out of the teats on the deck when we
                            would skin them. We caught female seals in milk more than 100 miles off
                            the Pribilof Islands.</p>
                        <p>We had 7 boats, and a stern boat and 3 men to a boat. Our hunters used
                            shotguns and were good hunters. They lost a good many seals, but I do
                            not know what <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0166"/>proportion was
                            lost to those killed. Some of the hunters would lose 4 out of every 6
                            killed. We tried to shoot them while asleep, but shot all that came in
                            our way. If we killed them too dead a great many would sink before we
                            could get them, and were lost. Sometimes we could get some of these that
                            had sunk with the gaff hook, but could not save many that way. A good
                            many are wounded and escape only to die afterwards.</p>
                        <p>Hunters talk about the seals increasing from year to year, but I know
                            they are decreasing, and if they keep on killing them the way they do
                            now there will not be any left in a few years.</p>

                        <p>Arthur Griffin, being duly sworn, deposes and says: My age is 24 years,
                            and am by occupation a seafaring man, and reside at Victoria, British
                            Columbia. On February 11, 1889, I sailed from Victoria as a boat puller
                            on the sealing schooner <hi rend="italic">Ariel</hi>, Buckman, master.
                            She carried 6 hunting boats and 1 stern boat and had a white crew who
                            use shotguns and rifles in hunting seals. We began sealing off the
                            northern coast of California and followed the sealing herd northward,
                            capturing about 700 seals in the North Pacific Ocean, two-thirds of
                            which were females with pups. The balance were young seals, both male
                            and female. We entered the Bering Sea on the 13th of July through the
                            Unamak Pass and captured between 900 and 1,000 seals therein, most of
                            which were females in milk. We returned to Victoria on 31st of August,
                            1889.</p>
                        <p>On January 10, 1890, I sailed from Victoria as a boat steerer in the
                            schooner <hi rend="italic">Sea Lion</hi>, Magason, master, and proceeded
                            to San Francisco where we fitted out for sealing. From there a month
                            later we went sealing. Our vessel carried a white crew, 5 boats, each
                            boat manned by 3 men. We captured about 300 seals from San Francisco to
                            Cape Flattery by the use of shotguns and rifles. We returned to Victoria
                            about April 1.</p>
                        <p>I went out sealing again the same year on the <hi rend="italic">E. B.
                                Marvin</hi>, McKiel, master. I shipped as a boat steerer. We had a
                            white crew and 7 boats and used shotguns and rifles while hunting the
                            seals. We captured between 900 and 1,000 on the coast, most of which
                            were females with pups. We entered the sea on July 12 through Unamak
                            Pass and captured about 800 seals in those waters, about 90 per cent of
                            which were females in milk.</p>
                        <p>A good hunter will often lose one-third of the seals he kills. A poor
                            hunter will lose two-thirds of those he shoots. On an average hunters
                            will lose 2 seals out of 3 of those they shoot. We captured females in
                            milk from 20 to 100 miles from the rookeries. Seals do not haul out upon
                            the land along the coast, nor do they give birth to their young on the
                            kelp. We seek to shoot the seals while they are asleep on the water,
                            because a seal shot while breeching is more likely to be lost. Seals
                            ought not to be killed in the water during the months of April, May,
                            June, July, and August.</p>

                            puller along the Northern Pacific coast about the 26th of June, 1891;
                            sailed from Victoria, British Columbia, in the <pb n="149"

                            south as the California coast and then hunted north to the west coast of
                            Vancouver Islands; caught 500 skins during the season; almost all of
                            them were pregnant females; out of 100 seals taken about 90 per cent
                            would be females with young pups in them. I can’t tell a male from a
                            female while in the water at a distance. On an average I think the
                            hunters will save about 1 out of 3 that they kill, but they wound many
                            more that escape and die afterwards. We entered the Bering Sea about the
                            1st of June, and caught about 200 seals in those waters. They were
                            mostly mothers that had given birth to their young, and were around the
                            fishing banks feeding. The hunters used shotguns and rifles. In the
                            Bering Sea we killed both male and female, but I do not know the
                            proportion of one to the other. I returned and was discharged at
                            Victoria, British Columbia, about the last of August.</p>
                        <p>I sailed again about February 12, 1892, in the same vessel and the same
                            master. We carried 2 boats and 3 men to each boat; all white men in the
                            boats, but we had 16 Indian canoes, with 2 Indians in each canoe, and
                            the Indians used shotguns, but did not capture any seals, and returned
                            to Victoria, British Columbia, the 1st of April, and I was discharged at
                            the custom-house at Victoria, British Columbia.</p>
                        <p>Seals were not as plentiful along the coast this year as they were in
                            1891. I think that for the proper preservation of the seals all pelagic
                            hunting should be prohibited until the mother seals have given birth to
                            their young.</p>

                        <p>James Jamieson, being first duly sworn, deposes and says: I am 23 years
                            old, and am by occupation a seaman; I reside at Victoria, British
                            Columbia. In March, 1887, I joined the British sealing schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">Mary Taylor</hi>, McKiel, master, at Victoria, British
                            Columbia. We went on a cruise for seal. I was boat puller. She carried 5
                            sealing boats, manned with 3 white men each. There were 3 Indians with
                            us part of the season. We used breech-loading shotguns and Winchester
                            rifles. We began to seal when about 20 miles off Cape Flattery. We
                            worked toward the northwest and captured between 60 and 100 seals on the
                            coast, about two-thirds of which were females with pup; the balance were
                            yearlings, consisting of male and female; after which we ran into
                            Barclay Sound for supplies, from which place we worked to the northward
                            toward the Bering Sea. We captured about 80 seals while en route to the
                            sea; about two-thirds of these were females with pup, the balance being
                            yearlings, about one-half male and one-half female.</p>
                        <p>In the latter part of January we entered the Bering Sea through the
                            Unamak Pass, and commenced sealing there. We captured about 800 seals at
                            a distance from the rookeries on the Pribilof Islands of from 20 miles
                            to 200 miles; about three-fourths of the catch in the sea was female
                            seals in milk, the balance consisting of yearlings and male seals. We
                            returned to Victoria, British Columbia, some time in August.</p>
                        <p>In January, 1888, I joined the <hi rend="italic">Mountain Chief</hi>,
                            Jacobson, master, at Victoria, British Columbia. I was mate on this
                            vessel. She carried 10 canoes, each manned by 2 Indians, who used spears
                            while hunting the seal. We began sealing along the coast and captured
                            about 85 seals, after which we sailed into Barclay Sound, when I left
                            the <hi rend="italic">Mountain Chief</hi> and joined the German schooner
                                <hi rend="italic">Adele</hi> as a cook. Hanson was captain of the
                                <hi rend="italic">Adele</hi>. We proceeded up the coast and took on
                            16 Indian sealers and 8 canoes. We then sealed along the coast toward
                            the sea, capturing about 100 seals en route. In the latter part of June
                            we entered the Bering Sea and proceeded to take seals in those waters.
                            Captured about 700 in the sea. We arrived back to Victoria on the 22d of
                            September.</p>
                        <p>In January, 1889, I shipped as a boat steerer on the British sealing
                            schooner <hi rend="italic">Theresa</hi>, Lawrence, master. She carried 6
                            boats, including the stern boat. Our crew and hunters were, white men
                            and were equipped with Winchester rifles and breechloading shotguns with
                            which to capture seals. We began sealing off the Columbia River and then
                            worked up along the coast, capturing about 380 seals before entering
                            Victoria, British Columbia, in April.</p>
                        <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0168"/>
                        <p>In January, 1890, I shipped as a boat steerer on the sealing schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">Mollie Adams</hi>, McKeil, master. She carried 6 boats
                            and a white crew, who used shotguns and rifles. We sailed as far south
                            as Cape Mendocino, when we met the herd and proceeded to take them up
                            along the coast, capturing about 400 seals, and then returned to
                            Victoria, British Columbia, where we fitted out for the west coast and
                            the Bering Sea. About the last of April I again sailed on a cruise for
                            seals on the same vessel, having the same crew. Sealed up along the
                            coast to Northeast Harbor, capturing 600 skins, which we transferred to
                            the American steamer <hi rend="italic">Mischief</hi> and shipped to
                            Victoria, British Columbia. We then sailed through the Unamak Pass into
                            the Bering Sea, when we at once began taking seals. Captured 1,000 seals
                            in that sea, and after remaining in those waters for about two months we
                            set sail for Victoria, British Columbia, on the 1st day of September,
                            and arrived at Victoria on the 21st of the same month.</p>
                        <p>In January, 1891, I shipped as a seaman on the British sealing schooner
                                <hi rend="italic">Mascot</hi>, Lawrence, master, for a cruise for
                            seals on the west coast. Our vessel carried 1 stern boat manned by white
                            men, and 8 canoes, with 2 Indians to each canoe. We began sealing off
                            Barclay Sound and caught 3 skins only, all of which were females with
                            pup. We then ran into Clayquot Sound, when I left the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Mascot</hi> and joined the British schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >Venture</hi>, Smith, master. I shipped as a seaman and hunter on
                            the British schooner <hi rend="italic">Venture</hi>. She carried an
                            Indian crew and 6 canoes. The Indians used spears and breech-loading
                            shotguns while hunting the seals. After securing our, Indian hunters we
                            went to the Bering Sea and proceeded along the coast. We captured 56
                            skins. We entered the sea through the Unamak Pass in the latter part of
                            June and commenced to catch seals. We captured 610 skins while in the
                            sea. In the latter part of July we were ordered out of the sea by the U.
                            S. S. <hi rend="italic">Thetis</hi>. We returned to Victoria. In
                            February, 1892, I joined the British sealing schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >Minnie</hi>, Tyson, master, at Dodges Cove, in Barclay Sound. I
                            shipped as cook. The <hi rend="italic">Minnie</hi> was equipped with 3
                            sealing boats, all manned with white men. We caught 5 seals along the
                            coast. We then returned to Victoria, British Columbia, about the 20th of
                            April.</p>
                        <p>In hunting along the coast I think about 80 per cent of those we caught
                            were females, and most of them were carrying their young. We seldom
                            caught any old bulls, but caught a few of the younger males. I have seen
                            the unborn young cut out of the mother seal and live for a week without
                            food. We used to skin some, but threw most of them overboard.</p>
                        <p>Nearly our whole catch in the Bering Sea after the 1st of July each year
                            were females, and nearly all of them in milk, and had evidently given
                            birth to their young but a short time before. The milk would run out on
                            the deck as we skinned them. The Indian hunters, with spears, would not
                            wound or lose but very few seals that they struck; but the ordinary
                            white hunter will, on an average, lose over half that he kills and
                            wounds. We try to take the seals when asleep on the waters, but the
                            hunters are usually paid a certain sum for each seal taken, and they try
                            to kill everything, without reference to age, sex, or condition.</p>
                        <p>I do not think that they haul upon the land on the coast, and I have
                            never known of anyone taking a young seal on the coast that was born
                            that year, nor do we catch any cow seals on the coast that have given
                            birth to their young that year.</p>

                        <p>Andrew Laing, being duly sworn, deposes and says: I am 42 years of age;
                            residence, Victoria, British Columbia; occupation, trader. I went out as
                            trader on the <hi rend="italic">W. P. Sayward</hi>, of which I was part
                            owner, in the years 1882, 1883, 1884, 1885, 1886, 1887, 1889, and 1890.
                            In 1888 I went as mate on the <hi rend="italic">Favorite</hi>, my boat
                            having been seized the year before by the revenue cutter <hi
                                rend="italic">Push</hi>, but was finally released, so that I went in
                            her again in 1889 and 1890. My vessel carried Indian hunters in all her
                            trips previous to this year (1892), and they used canoes and spears in
                            hunting seals exclusively. Prior to 1886 I nor my vessel had ever been
                            in the Bering Sea hunting, but had cruised along the coast each year
                            from the Columbia River to Kodiak <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151"
                                facs="0169"/>Island, and then returned to Victoria, and had caught
                            seals in greater or less numbers each year; but in 1886 and each year
                            thereafter, excepting 1891, I have not only sealed on the coast, but
                            have also been in the Bering Sea hunting seals.</p>
                        <p>My vessel went to the Bering Sea in 1891, but I did not go with her. The
                            year I was on the <hi rend="italic">Favorite</hi> she carried Indian
                            hunters also, who used spears. It is now the practice to hunt along the
                            coast early in the season from the Columbia River to the Bering Sea and
                            enter those waters the fore part of July. Indian hunters will not stay
                            out over ten days at a time when we are on the coast, so we have to come
                            in and out quite often. This year I have changed my crew into white
                            hunters, who use shotguns and rifles. When in Bering Sea we are usually
                            from 50 to 150 miles from the Pribilof Islands. I did not pay any
                            particular attention to the sex of the seals we caught on the coast or
                            in the sea any further than we got a number of the yearlings and
                            2-year-olds on the coast, and that I have seen young live pups cut out
                            of their dead mothers, and they would walk around on deck and bleat for
                            three or four days and then die of starvation. In the Bering Sea I have
                            noticed that in skinning seals milk would run out of the teats of
                            females who had given birth recently to their young on the islands. I
                            have caught this class of females from 75 to 100 miles from the Pribilof
                            Islands.</p>
                        <p>I know of no place along the eastern coast where fur seals haul out on
                            land, and I do not believe there is any outside of the Pribilof Islands.
                            Fur seals do not give birth to their young in the water, neither will
                            the pup seal live if born in the water. I can not say as to seals
                            appearing off the coast in less numbers each year, but I think some
                            arrangement should be made for their protection by a closed season
                            during the time they are carrying and nursing their young.</p>

                        <p>Charles Peterson, being duly sworn, deposes and says: I am 36 years old,
                            and am by occupation a seafaring man; my residence is Victoria, British
                            Columbia. In April, 1886, I went seal hunting from Victoria in the
                            schooner <hi rend="italic">Mountain Chief</hi>, Jacobson, master. Our
                            schooner carried 10 canoes, each manned by 2 Indians, who hunted with
                            spears. We began sealing off Cape Flattery and captured about 300 seals
                            along the coast, most all of which were females and yearlings. We did
                            not capture over 50 males, all told, on this voyage, and returned to
                            Victoria in July.</p>
                        <p>In the spring of 1887 I went on a sealing voyage from Victoria as a boat
                            puller in the schooner <hi rend="italic">Alfred Adams</hi>, Dyre,
                            master. She carried 1 stern boat and 2 Indian canoes. We had a white
                            crew, but the canoes Were manned by 2 Indians each. We began sealing off
                            Cape Flattery and sealed right up toward the Bering Sea, capturing 16
                            seals along the coast, all of which were females with pup. We entered
                            the Bering Sea about the 15th of August through the Unimak Pass and
                            captured therein 1,404 seals, most of which were cows in milk. On that
                            voyage we caught female seals in milk over 80 miles from the rookeries,
                            where they had left their young. Our best hunters would secure half of
                            the seals shot, but the poorest ones would not get more than 1 out of
                            20, the average being 1 secured out of 5 killed.</p>
                        <p>I have seen the deck almost flooded with milk while we were skinning the
                            seals. It is impossible to distinguish the male seal from the female
                            when they are in the water at a reasonable gunshot distance. About 90
                            per cent of all the seals we captured in the water were female seals.
                            After remaining in the sea about fifteen days our vessel was seized and
                            we returned to Victoria.</p>
                        <p>In April, 1890, I went sealing in the <hi rend="italic">Minnie</hi>,
                            Jacobson, master. She carried 14 canoes, manned with Indians, 2 Indians
                            with each canoe, who used spears. We caught 350 seals along the coast,
                            all of which were females excepting 20. We returned to Victoria in
                            June.</p>
                        <p>In January, 1891, I left Victoria on a sealing voyage in the schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">Minnie</hi>, Dillon, master. We carried 2 boats manned
                            by white men and 10 canoes, each manned by 2 Indians, who used shotguns.
                            We captured 250 female seals with pup on the coast and then returned to
                            Victoria, after which we sailed again in a short time on the same vessel
                            with the same crew for the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, capturing
                            about 250 female seals while en route to the Bering Sea, also a few male
                            yearlings. We entered the sea and secured about 10 seals, all of which
                            were females in milk. After remaining there ten days we started back to
                            Victoria.</p>
                        <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0170"/>
                        <p>The practice of taking seals in the water before they have given birth to
                            their young is destructive to seal life, wasteful, and should be
                            prohibited. Seals do not haul out upon the land along the coast and give
                            birth to their young; nor do they breed on the kelp. If ever there was
                            such an occurrence it must have been a premature birth caused by some
                            accident to the female seal, and would result in the death of her
                            young.</p>
                        <p>Previous to 1885 only 2 or 3 sealing vessels had ever gone to the Bering
                            Sea to hunt seals, and the sealing from Victoria prior to 1886 was
                            confined to the coast, and the crews were Indians who hunted with
                            spears. Seals were caught by them with spears and but few were lost; but
                            since the shotgun has come into use a great many are destroyed and
                            lost.</p>

                        <p>Edwin P. Porter, being duly sworn, deposes and says: My age is 25 years;
                            residence, Victoria, British Columbia; occupation, seaman and seal
                            hunter. I went out sealing as boat steerer on the British schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">Penelope</hi>, Captain Steel, master; I think it was
                            in the year 1888 when I went in her. She had 5 boats and white hunters.
                            They used shotguns and rifles—shotguns chiefly. We left Victoria about
                            the last of January and cruised along the California and Oregon coast
                            and caught about 1,000 seals before we entered Bering Sea. We entered
                            the sea about the first week in July and caught about 1,100 more. We
                            left the sea about the latter part of September. We caught some off the
                            Copper Island, but most of them were taken from 30 to 100 miles south
                            and southwest of the Pribilof Islands.</p>
                        <p>In 1889 I went as boat steerer on the British schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >Ariel</hi>, Captain Rucknam, master. She had 6 boats and 4 canoes.
                            Carried both white and Indian hunters. White hunters used shotguns and
                            rifles. Indians used spears chiefly. We left Victoria in February and
                            sealed over about the same course as the year before and entered the
                            Bering Sea in July. We took about 500 skins before entering the sea and
                            caught about 1,600 more around the southwest bank, from 30 to 75 miles
                            from St. Paul Island. We were ordered out of the sea about the 1st of
                            September by the revenue cutter <hi rend="italic">Rush.</hi></p>
                        <p>In 1890 I did not go sealing.</p>
                        <p>In 1891 I sailed as boat steerer in the British schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">Umbrina</hi>, Captain Campbell, master. She carried 7
                            boats and had white hunters, who used shotguns and rifles. Left Victoria
                            in March and sealed along the coast. I left her before she went into the
                            sea. Her whole season’s catch was about 900, but do not know what
                            portion of them she caught before entering Bering Sea. This year I went
                            as boat steerer in the British steamer <hi rend="italic">Thistle</hi>.
                            She had 6 sealing boats and 2 whaling boats and carried white hunters,
                            with shotguns and rifles. She left Victoria in February and sealed off
                            the California coast. I left her in March. She had only 79 skins.</p>
                        <p>My experience in four years’ sealing is that nearly all the seals taken
                            along the coast are pregnant females, and it is seldom that one of them
                            is caught that has not a young pup in her. In the fore part of the
                            season the pup is small, but in May and June when they are taken off the
                            Queen Charlotte and Kadiac Islands the unborn pup is quite large, and we
                            frequently take them out of the mothers alive. I have kept some of them
                            alive for six weeks that were cut out of their mothers by feeding them
                            on condensed milk. The seals we captured in Bering Sea were fully 80 per
                            cent females that had given birth to their young. A fact that I often
                            noticed was that their teats would be full of milk when I skinned them,
                            and I have seen them killed from 20 to 100 miles from the Seal Islands.
                            We try to kill the seal while sleeping on the water, but also shoot at
                            them when they are breaching.</p>
                        <p>An ordinary hunter will lose about 4 out of every 6 he kills. Some do not
                            do near as well, while others do better. The percentage of loss to those
                            killed is less on the coast than it is in the Bering Sea, for the seals
                            are more fat and do not sink as quick, but a great many are wounded and
                            lost. The Indians, when they use the spears, lose but very few. They get
                            up close to the sleeper and scarcely ever miss getting it. I <pb n="153"
                                xml:id="pg_153" facs="0171"/>know of no place on the coast where
                            seals come up to land, and I am positive there is none. Seals are not
                            near as plentiful as when I went out in 1888, and I believe the decrease
                            is due to their being hunted so much with shotguns and rifles.</p>

                            torn from the wombs of their dead mothers. It is not a pleasant picture,
                            but it can not be avoided.</p>

                        <p>Herman Liebes, being duly sworn, says:</p>
                        <p>First. That he is 50 years of age and resides in the city of San
                            Francisco, Cal. That he has been in the fur business since he was 13
                            years of age, and established in his own business in San Francisco in
                            the year 1864. That he first began to buy seal <pb n="154"
                                xml:id="pg_154" facs="0172"/>skins in the year 1865. At that time he
                            made his purchases from the Indians on the western coast of the American
                            continent, who offered to him only the skins of female seals; that the
                            price he originally paid for them was as low as 50 cents per skin; that
                            he offered the Indians a much higher price for male skins, and was told
                            by them that the male seals could not be caught, and that many Indians
                            whom he has personally seen kill seals, and from whom he has bought
                            skins, have told him that male seals and the young cows were too active
                            to be caught, and that it was only the female seals heavy with young
                            which they could catch. The males, for instance, as deponent was told by
                            the seal hunters, come up to the surface of the water after diving,
                            often as much as a mile from the place they went down; whereas the
                            females can, when pregnant, hardly dive at all.</p>
                        <p>Deponent says that from his own observation of live seals during many
                            years, and from his personal inspection of the skins, he knows the
                            difference between the skin of a female seal and a male seal to be very
                            marked, and that the two are easily distinguishable. The skin of the
                            female seal shows the marks of the breast, about which there is no fur.
                            The belly of the female seal is barren of fur also, whereas on the male
                            the fur is thick and evenly distributed. The female seal has a much
                            narrower head than the male seal, and this difference is apparent in the
                            skins; also that the differences between the male and female skins are
                            so marked that there is now and always has been a difference in the
                            price of the two of from 300 to 500 per cent—for example, at the last
                            sales in London, on the 22d day of January, 1892, there were sold 30,000
                            female skins at a price of 40 shillings apiece, and 13,000 male seals at
                            a price of 130 shillings apiece on an average.</p>
                        <p>Second. That from the year 1864 down to the present day deponent or his
                            firm have been large purchasers of seal skins on the western coast of
                            America from the Indians and residents on the British coast; and
                            deponent believes that he has handled nearly three-fourths of the catch
                            from that time down to the present. That during the whole of this period
                            he has purchased from 3,000 to 40,000 seal skins a year, and that he has
                            personally inspected and physically handled the most of the skins so
                            bought by him or his firm.</p>
                        <p>That from the year 1880 he has been in the habit of buying skins from
                            American and English vessels engaged in what is now known as poaching,
                            and that he has personally inspected every cargo bought and seen
                            unloaded from the poaching vessels, and subsequently seen and
                            superintended the unpacking of the same in his own warehouse; that the
                            most of the skins above mentioned as purchased by him have been bought
                            from the poaching vessels, and that of the skins so bought from the
                            vessels known as poachers, deponent says that at least 90 per cent of
                            the total number of skins were those of female seals, and that the skins
                            of male seals found among those cargoes were the skins of very small
                            animals, not exceeding 2 years of age, and further, that the age of the
                            seal may be told accurately from the size of its skin.</p>
                        <p>Third. That the, skins bought at Victoria from the poaching vessels are
                            shipped by him largely to the firm of C. M. Lampson &amp; Co., in
                            London, who are the largest sellers of skins in the world and the agents
                            of deponent’s firm. That he has been through the establishment of C. H.
                            Lampson &amp; Co. in London very frequently. That he has frequently
                            heard stated by the superintendent thereof that the great majority of
                            the skins received by them from what is called the “Northwest catch,”
                            that is, the northwest coast of Victoria, are the skins of seals caught
                            by vessels in the open Pacific or the Bering Sea, and that a large
                            proportion of said skins, amounting to at least 90 per cent, were in
                            his, the said superintendent’s, judgment obviously the skins of female
                            seals.</p>
                        <p>Fourth. That deponent has frequently requested the captains of the
                            poaching vessels sailing from the port of Victoria and other ports to
                            obtain the skins of male seals, and stated that he would give twice as
                            much money, or even more, for such skins than he would pay for the skins
                            of female seals. Each and all of the captains so approached laughed at
                            the idea of catching male seals in the open sea, and said that it was
                            impossible for them to do it, and that they could not catch male seals
                            unless they could get upon the islands, which, except once in a long
                            while, they were unable to do in consequence of the restrictions imposed
                            by the United States Government; because they said the males were more
                            active and could outswim any boat which their several vessels had, and
                            that it was only the female seals who were heavy with young which could
                            be caught. Among the captains of vessels with whom deponent has talked,
                            and who have stated to him that they were unable to catch anything but
                            female seals, are the following:</p>
                        <p>Captain Cathcart, an American, now about 75 years of age, who commanded
                            the schooner <hi rend="italic">San Diego</hi>, and who subsequently
                            commanded other vessels; Capt. Harry Harmson, Capt. George W.
                            Littlejohn, Capt. A. Carlson, Gustav Sundvall, and others whose names he
                            does not now remember.</p>
                        <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0173"/>
                        <p>Fifth. That by reason of his long acquaintance with the business and his
                            conversations with the captains of the vessels called poachers, and the
                            hunters employed on those vessels—that is, the persons who actually
                            shoot the seals—deponent is satisfied that a large number of the seals
                            which are shot are not caught, but are lost, and that the number so
                            killed and lost is at least 25 to 30 per cent.</p>
                        <p>Deponent further says that by reason of his knowledge of the business he
                            knows that the number of seals has greatly diminished within the last
                            five years, and he is of the opinion that open-sea seal fishing should
                            be absolutely prohibited, and that if the same is not done the seals
                            will within two, or at the utmost three, years be exterminated. This
                            opinion is based upon the assumption that the present restriction
                            imposed by the United States and Russia on the number, age, and sex of
                            the seals killed upon the islands owned by them respectively are to be
                            maintained.</p>
                        <p>Deponent is further of the opinion that it would be necessary, in order
                            to fully protect the herds, to prohibit, at least for a time, the
                            killing of all female seals anywhere. That one reason for deponent’s
                            opinion that the total number of seals in the Pacific and Bering Sea has
                            diminished very rapidly is the fact—which deponent knows from the fact
                            that he buys so large a portion of the poachers’ catch—that there are
                            now engaged on what is called “poaching” about 80 vessels, and that
                            about five years ago not more than 10 vessels were engaged in poaching;
                            and that the total number of skins brought in by the whole 80 vessels is
                            now not very much greater than the number brought in five years ago by
                            10 vessels. The poaching vessels a few years ago have been known to get
                            as many as 3,000 or 4,000 skins, and deponent has bought 4,000 skins
                            from one vessel, whereas no poaching vessel now gets more than a few
                            hundred with the same size crew. One vessel last year sailing from
                            Victoria made a catch of 1,900 skins, but this is now an altogether
                            exceptional catch, and this vessel had a crew twice as large as poaching
                            vessels formerly carried, and was equipped with from 12 to 15 boats
                            instead of 5 or 6. One or two other poaching vessels also made large
                            catches—that is, over 1,200 skins—but the average catch of the poaching
                            vessels is not more than a few hundred each. This is true, although the
                            poaching vessels are now equipped with much more experienced shooters,
                            with better rifles, and with better boats than any of the vessels had
                            five years ago. Many of the poaching vessels now have boats pointed at
                            both ends, so that they can go backward or forward with equal ease; and
                            the old poacher only had ordinary ships’ boats. Deponent knows this to
                            be true, because he has seen the boats and talked with the captains of
                            the schooners about them.</p>

                        <p>John J. Phelan, being duly sworn, says: I am 35 years of age, a citizen
                            of the United States, and a resident of Albany, in the State of New
                            York. At the age of 11 I entered the service of Mr. George C. Treadwell,
                            a wholesale furrier of Albany. I remained with him until the time of his
                            death, and have since been in the employ of his son, Mr. George H.
                            Treadwell, who has succeeded to the business carried on by his father.
                            It has always been a part of my occupation, beginning with the age of
                            11, to handle fur-seal skins, and during the last twenty years I have
                            handled nearly every seal skin that came into the factory. I have for
                            many years been in the habit of putting them through every process
                            connected with their preparation for manufacture, except that of dyeing,
                            with which I am not familiar. I have removed the flesh and blubber; I
                            have washed the skins; removed the hair, or “picked” them, shaved them,
                            and dressed them; and in this way I have constantly gone over and
                            closely observed every part of their surfaces in all the stages or
                            processes through which they pass before they go to the dyer.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the work I have performed for so many years, I am able to
                            distinguish, without difficulty, the skin of a female seal from that of
                            a male seal. There are generally several ways in which I can tell them
                            apart. One of the surest ways consists in seeing whether any teats can
                            be found. On a female skin above the age of two years teats can
                            practically always be discovered; when the animal is over three years
                            old, even a person who is not an expert at handling skins can discover
                            two prominent ones on each side of almost every skin. This is because
                            after the age of <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0174"/>three, and
                            often even after two, almost all females have been in pup. There are
                            also teats on a male skin, but they are only very slightly developed.
                            When the fur is matted, as it is in salted fur-seal skins, the male
                            teats can not be found, but the female teats of skins more than two
                            years old can be found under all circumstances.</p>
                        <p>I have been able to test all my observations as to the teats on salted
                            fur-seal skins by following these skins through the various processes
                            which I have described. During these processes the skins become thinner
                            and thinner, and the teats more and more noticeable, and at an early
                            stage in the dressing they must be wholly removed. There are other ways
                            of distinguishing the skins of the two sexes. I will state a few of
                            them.</p>
                        <p>A female seal has a narrower head than a male seal. By the word “head” I
                            mean here to include the part of the body from the head down to the
                            middle of the back. I believe all men who have handled the skins of both
                            sexes have noticed this point.</p>
                        <p>Then, again, when the whiskers have not been cut off, they generally
                            afford a safe means of distinguishing the sexes. Male whiskers are much
                            more brittle and of a darker color than those of the female animal. When
                            the male seal is over six years old it begins to have a mane, and for
                            this reason it is after that age called a wig.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it is generally possible for me to tell the skins of the two
                            sexes apart by just taking a look at them or feeling them. I suppose I
                            can do this because I have been at the business so long that I am an
                            expert in it.</p>
                        <p>The chief classes of seal skins which I have handled are the Alaska, the
                            Northwest coast, and the Copper Island skins. I can always distinguish
                            the skins of these classes. The Northwest coast skins are most easily
                            told by the very great proportion of females contained in any given lot.
                            Among the Alaska and Copper skins I have hardly ever seen a female
                            skin.</p>
                        <p>While the Alaska and Northwest coast skins are taken from the same
                            species or herd of seals, I am convinced that the Copper skins are taken
                            from seals of a different herd. I have noticed the difference in the
                            skins, both in their raw state and during the processes of dressing. The
                            hair of the Copper skin is shorter, thinner, and generally of a somewhat
                            darker color than that of the Alaska or Northwest coast skins, and in
                            most cases the difference in shape is sufficiently marked to enable me
                            to distinguish them by that means alone.</p>
                        <p>The difference between the Copper and the other skins is still more
                            marked during the processes of dressing. It is very much more difficult
                            to unhair a Copper skin. Furthermore, the pelts of the Copper skins are
                            less porous than those of the other skins. While preparing skins for
                            dressing it is necessary to “work” them and open the pores in order to
                            “leather” them, and it is during this process that I have noticed the
                            fact that Copper skins are much less porous than the others. The pelt
                            being harder and stiffer and the hair more brittle, we can hardly ever
                            unhair a Copper skin as satisfactorily as we can the other skins.</p>
                        <p>I was sent to New York from Albany a few days ago by Mr. George H. Tread
                            well, with instructions to go through a certain lot of seal skins, which
                            I understand he had recently bought in Victoria, and to find out how
                            many of these skins were taken from female animals. I have spent four
                            days in doing this, working about seven hours a day.</p>
                        <p>There were several men who unpacked the skins and laid them before me, so
                            that all of my time was spent in examining the individual skins. The lot
                            contained 3,550 skins. I found that, with the possible exception of two
                            dried ones, they were taken from animals this year; they were a part of
                            what is known as the spring catch. I know this to be the case by the
                            fresh appearance of the blubber and of the skin as a whole. This affords
                            a sure way of telling whether the skin has lain in salt all winter, or
                            whether it has been recently salted. I personally inspected each one of
                            these skins by itself and kept an accurate record of the result. I
                            divided the skins according to the three following classes: Males,
                            females, and pups. In the class of pups I placed only the skins of
                            animals less than two years of age, but without reference to sex.</p>
                        <p>I found in the lot 395 males, 2,167 females, and 988 pups. Leaving out of
                            account the pups, the percentage of females was therefore about 82.</p>
                        <p>The great majority of what I classed as male skins were taken from
                            animals less than three years of age. There was not a single wig in the
                            lot. On the other hand, nearly all of the female skins were those of
                            full-grown animals. On every skin which I classed among the females I
                            found teats with bare spots about them on the fur side. Such bare spots
                            make it absolutely certain that these teats were those of female
                            skins.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the pup skins, I will say that I did not undertake to
                            determine whether they were males or females, because they had a thick
                            coat of blubber, which, in the case of an animal less than two years
                            old, makes it very hard to tell the sex.</p>
                        <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0175"/>
                        <p>All of the skins that I examined were either shot or speared. I did not
                            keep a close count, but I am of the opinion that about 75 per cent of
                            them were shot.</p>
                        <p>The result of the examination is about what I had expected it would be.
                            The figures only confirm what I have always noticed in a general way,
                            that nearly ninetenths of the skins in any shipment of Northwest coast
                            skins are those of female animals.</p>

                        <p>Henry Treadwell, being duly sworn, says that he is a citizen of the
                            United; States, is 70 years of age, and resides in the city of Brooklyn,
                            in the State of New York.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First. That he is a member of the firm of Treadwell &amp; Co,
                                which has been engaged in the business of buying, dressing, and
                                dealing in furs since about the year 1832. That for the twenty years
                                last past deponent’s said firm have bought on their own account,
                                dressed and dyed, annually from 5,000 to 8,000 seal skins.</item>
                            <item>Second. That nearly all of the skins purchased by deponent’s said
                                firm are bought of C. M. Lampson &amp; Co., of London, who are the
                                largest dealers in seal skins in the world. That the majority of the
                                skins bought by said firm are a part of the skins known as the
                                “Alaska” catch, that is, as deponent is informed and believes, the
                                skins of seals killed on the Pribilof Islands by the companies
                                having leases from the United States for that purpose. A certain
                                number of skins bought by deponent’s firm are those killed upon the
                                Russian, called the Commander Islands, known as the Copper catch,
                                and about 30 per cent of the whole number of seal skins bought by
                                deponent’s firm are what are called the Northwest coast skins—the
                                skins of animals killed and caught in the open sea.</item>
                            <item>Third. That the skins of each of the several catches are readily
                                distinguishable from each other by any person at all experienced in
                                the handling of seal skins; and the skins of the Northwest, Alaska,
                                or Copper catch, are none of them found except under those titles,
                                that is to say, that skins of the “Copper” catch are not found among
                                the “Alaska” seal skins, nor those of the Northwest catch among the
                                Alaska for Copper seal skins. The skins of the three catches are so
                                readily distinguishable from each other that deponent says he would
                                be able, on the examination of the skins as they are taken from the
                                barrels in which they are packed in salt and received by him, to
                                detect at once in a barrel of Alaska skins, the skins of either the
                                Copper or the Northwest catch; or in a barrel of the Northwest catch
                                the skins of either the Alaska or the Copper catch, or in a barrel
                                of the Copper catch the skins of either the Alaska or Northwest
                                catch. The skins of the Alaska and Copper catches are readily
                                distinguishable from each other, although male skins; and the skins
                                of the Northwest catch are also readily distinguishable from both
                                the Copper and Alaska by the act that they are almost all females,
                                and all have marks of bullets, buckshot, or spears, showing that
                                they have been killed at sea, although the Northwest catch belong to
                                the Pribilof Island herd.</item>
                            <item>Fourth. That the skins of the Northwest catch are, deponent would
                                say, at least nine-tenths of them, skins of female seals. The skins
                                of the female seals are as readily distinguishable, before being
                                dressed and dyed, from the skins of male seals as the skin of a
                                bitch and the skin of a dog, or the skin of any other female animal
                                from that of the male of the same family. The females always have
                                narrower heads than the males, and the breasts afford another ready
                                means of identification of female seals.</item>
                            <item>Fifth. It is equally true that the skins of all the other catches
                                which we had in prior years were readily distinguishable from each
                                other. I have not seen the seals in their native rookeries, and can
                                not speak as to the distinguishing traits of the live animals, but
                                in the trade and in the experience of our firm we have always been
                                able to distinguish readily the skins coming from one locality from
                                the skins coming from another. I remember upon one occasion my firm
                                received a consignment of skins from London which bore no marks
                                familiar to us and which skins had not been described to us, and
                                that my brother, who was then at the head of the business, <pb

                                after inspecting the said skins, that they reminded him very much of
                                what were formerly called “south latitude skins,” and particularly
                                of some skins which he had had twenty-odd years before from Santa
                                Barbara, in California; and upon inquiry from the Messrs. Lampson
                                &amp; Co., we were informed by them that the said skins were the
                                skins of seals killed at Santa Barbara.</item>

                            Lampson &amp; Co., furriers, London.]</p>

                        <p>Alfred Fraser, being duly sworn, says:</p>
                        <p>First. That he is a subject of Her Britannic Majesty, and is 52 years of
                            age, and resides in the city of Brooklyn, in the State of New York. That
                            he is a member of the firm of C. M. Lampson &amp; Co., of London, and
                            has been a member of said firm for about thirteen years; prior to that
                            time he was in the employ of said firm and took an active part in the
                            management of the business of said firm in London. That the business of
                            C. M. Lampson &amp; Co. is that of merchants, engaged principally in the
                            business of selling fur skins on commission. That for about twenty-four
                            years the firm of C. M. Lampson &amp; Co. have sold the great majority
                            of the whole number of seal skins sold in all the markets of the world.
                            That while he was engaged in the management of the business of said firm
                            in London he had personal knowledge of the character of the various seal
                            skins sold by the said firm from his personal inspection of the same in
                            their warehouse and from the physical handling of the same by him. That
                            many hundred thousands of the skins sold by C. M. Lampson &amp; Co. have
                            physically passed through his hands; and that since his residence in
                            this country he has, as a member of said firm, had a general and
                            detailed knowledge of the character and extent of the business of said
                            firm, although since his residence in the city of New York he has not
                            physically handled the skins disposed of by his firm.</p>
                        <p>That during the last year or two a large number of skins have been sold
                            in London by the firm of Culverwell, Brooks &amp; Co., and that said
                            firm, as deponent is informed and believes, have secured the consignment
                            of skins to them during the period aforesaid by advancing to the owners
                            of vessels engaged in what is now known as pelagic sealing sums of
                            money, which is stated to be $15 per skin, as against shipments from
                            Victoria of such skins.</p>
                        <p>Second. That the seal skins which have been sold in London from time to
                            time since deponent first began business have been obtained from sources
                            and were known in the markets as—</p>
                        <p>(A) The South Sea skins, being the skins of seals principally caught on
                            the South Shetland Islands, South Georgia Islands, and Sandwich Land.
                            That many years ago large numbers of seals were caught upon these
                            islands, but in consequence of the fact that no restrictions were
                            imposed on the killing of said seals they were practically exterminated
                            and no seal skins appeared in the market from those localities for many
                            years. That about twenty years ago these islands were again visited, and
                            for five seasons a considerable catch was made, amounting during the
                            whole five seasons to about 30,000 or 40,000 skins. Among the skins
                            found in this catch were those of the oldest males and the smallest
                            pups, thus showing, in the judgment of deponent, that every seal of
                            every kind was killed that could be reached. That in consequence thereof
                            the rookeries on these islands were then completely exhausted. One or
                            twice thereafter they were visited without result, no seals being found,
                            and about five years ago they were revisited and only 36 skins were
                            obtained. Deponent is informed that all the South Sea skins were
                            obtained by killing seals upon the islands above mentioned, and that it
                            is obviously everywhere much easier to kill seals upon the land than in
                            the water; and in the judgment of the deponent the seals of the
                            above-mentioned islands were thus entirely exterminated because of the
                            entire absence of any protection or of any restriction of any kind
                            whatever upon the number, age, or sex of seals killed, and not merely,
                            as deponent understands has been claimed by some authorities, because
                            they were killed on land instead of in the open sea, which, moreover, in
                            that locality, deponent is informed, is practically impossible by reason
                            of the roughness of the sea and weather.</p>
                        <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0177"/>
                        <p>(B) A considerable number of seal skins were formerly obtained upon the
                            Falkland Islands; how many deponent is not able to state.</p>
                        <p>(C) That a certain number of seals were also caught at Cape Horn, and
                            that more or less are still taken in that vicinity, though the whole
                            number has been very greatly reduced.</p>
                        <p>(D) That at the present time and for many years last past the skins
                            coming to the market and which are known to commerce have come from the
                            following sources:</p>
                        <p>1. And by far the most important are the Northern Pacific skins, which
                            are known to the trade under the following titles:</p>
                        <p>The “Alaska” catch, which are the skins of seals caught on the Pribilof
                            Islands, situated in Bering Sea. For many years past the whole of the
                            skins caught upon these islands have been sold by deponent’s firm, and a
                            statement of the number of skins so sold in each year is appended hereto
                            and marked “Exhibit A,” showing the aggregate of such skins sold from
                            the year 1870 to the year 1891, inclusive, as 1,877,977.</p>
                        <p>The “Copper” catch, being the skins of seals caught upon what are known
                            as the Commander Islands, being the islands known as the Copper and
                            Bering Islands. All the skins so caught have been sold by the deponent’s
                            firm in the city of London, and the total number of such “Copper” catch
                            from the years 1872 to 1892 appears upon the statement which is hereto
                            annexed and marked “Exhibit B,” showing the total so sold during such
                            years of 768,096 skins.</p>
                        <p>The “Northwest” catch, being the skins of seals caught in the open sea
                            either of the Pacific Ocean or of the Bering Sea. These skins were
                            originally caught exclusively by the Indians and by residents of the
                            colony of Victoria and along the coast of the British possessions. A
                            statement of the total number of the catch from the year 1868 to 1884,
                            inclusive, is appended hereto and marked “Exhibit C,” showing a total of
                            153,348. That statement is divided into three heads: First, the salted
                            “Northwest” coast skins; second, the dried “Northwest” coast skins, both
                            of which were mainly sold through deponent’s firm in London, and third,
                            salted “Northwest” coast skins, dressed and dyed in London, but not sold
                            there. It will be noticed that in the years 1871 and 1872 an unusuall y
                            large proportion of dried skins appear to have been marketed. Those
                            skins were purchased in this year from the Russian-American Company,
                            which was the lessee of the Russian Government on the Pribilof Islands
                            prior to the cession of Russian America to the United States. Those
                            skins had been accumulated by the Russian Company and sold when the
                            Americans took possession. For the years 1871 and 1872, therefore, the
                            surplus skins over the average for the other years should be rejected in
                            a computation of the general average of seals killed during the years
                            from 1868 to 1884, inclusive.</p>
                        <p>From the year 1885 to the year 1891 the number of skins included in the
                            “Northwest” catch enormously increased, and a statement of such skins is
                            hereto annexed and marked “Exhibit D,” showing a total of 331,962, and
                            is divided, like the statement marked “Exhibit C,” into three heads: The
                            salted “Northwest” coast skins, the dry “Northwest” coast skins, and the
                            salted skins dressed and dyed in London, but not sold there. The
                            majority of the first two classes were, as in the previous case, sold by
                            deponent’s firm. The great majority of these skins appearing in the last
                            mentioned statement are the skins caught by the vessels sent out from
                            the Canadian Provinces, many also by vessels sent out from San
                            Francisco, Port Townsend, and Seattle, and a few from vessels sent Out
                            from Yokohama. The majority, however, are supposed to have been caught
                            by vessels sent out from British harbors. A large number of the skins
                            included in “Exhibit D” have been consigned to C. M. Lampson &amp; Co.
                            by the firm of Herman, Liebes &amp; Co., of San Francisco. In estimating
                            the total number of the “Northwest” catch it should also be mentioned
                            that something like 30,000 skins belonging to that catch have been
                            dressed and dyed in the United States which have not gone to London at
                            all.</p>
                        <p>(E) Besides the “Alaska,” “Copper,” and “Northwest” skins, there are also
                            a certain number of skins arriving in London known as the Lobos Island
                            skins, although the same are not handled by the firm of C. M. Lampson
                            &amp; Co.; but the total number of which, from the year 1882 to the year
                            1891, inclusive, is, as appears from the catalogues of sales, 247,777.
                            The Lobos Island skins are those of seals killed on the Lobos Island,
                            belonging to the Republic of Uruguay; and deponent is informed and
                            believes that there is no open-sea sealing in the vicinity of such
                            island and that the animals are protected on the island as they are on
                            the Russian and Pribilof Islands, by prohibition from the killing of
                            females and limiting the number of males killed in each year. A
                            statement of the seals killed on Lobos Island is hereto annexed and
                            marked “Exhibit E,” from which it appears that there is a regular annual
                            supply obtained from that source, which shows no diminution.</p>
                        <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0178"/>
                        <p>(F) There are also a certain number of skins sold in London, obtained
                            from rookeries at or near the Cape of Good Hope, the exact number of
                            which deponent is not able to state, but which he is informed shows a
                            steady yield.</p>
                        <p>The statements marked A, B, C, D, and E, hereunto appended, have been
                            carefully prepared by me personally, and the figures therein stated have
                            been compiled by me from the several sale catalogues of C. M. Lampson
                            &amp; Co., and others from my private books which I had kept during all
                            the years covered by the statements, and I am sure that those statements
                            are substantially accurate and truly state the respective numbers of the
                            skins caught and sold which they purport to state.</p>
                        <p>Third. The great majority of the skins sold from the “Northwest” catch
                            are the skins of female seals. Deponent is notable to state exactly what
                            proportion of such skins are the skins of females, but estimates it to
                            be at least 85 per cent; and the skins of females are readily
                            distinguishable from those of the males by reason of the fact that on
                            the breast and on the belly of the bearing female there is comparatively
                            little fur, whereas on the skins of the male seals the fur is evenly
                            distributed; and also by reason of the fact that the female seal has a
                            narrow head and the male seal a broad head and neck; and the skins of
                            this catch are also distinguishable from the “Alaska” and “Copper”
                            catch, by reason of the fact that the seals are killed by bullets or
                            buckshot, or speared, and not, as on the Pribilof and Commander Islands,
                            by clubs. Marks of such bullets, or buckshot, or spears are clearly
                            discernible in the skins, and there is a marked difference in the
                            commercial value of the female skins and of the male skins. This fact,
                            that the “Northwest” skins are so largely the skins of females, is
                            further evidenced by the fact that in many of the early sales of such
                            skins they are classified in deponent’s book as the skins of
                            “females.”</p>
                        <p>Fourth. Deponent further says that in his judgment the absolute
                            prohibition of pelagic sealing, i. e., the killing of seals in the open
                            sea, whether in the North Pacific or the Bering Sea, is necessary to the
                            preservation of the seal herds now surviving, by reason of the fact that
                            most of the females so killed are heavy with young, and that necessarily
                            the increase of the species is diminished by their killing. And,
                            further, from the fact that a large number of females are killed in the
                            Bering Sea while on the search for food after the birth of their young,
                            and that in consequence thereof the pups die for want of nourishment.
                            Deponent has no personal knowledge of the truth of this statement, but
                            he has information in respect of the same from persons who have been on
                            the Pribilof Islands, and he believes the same to be true. Deponent
                            further says that this opinion is based upon the assumption that the
                            present restriction imposed by Russia and the United States on the
                            killing of seals in their respective islands are to be maintained,
                            otherwise it would be necessary to impose such restrictions, as well as
                            to prohibit palagic sealing, in order to preserve the herds.</p>
                        <p>Fifth. Deponent is further of the opinion, from his long observation and
                            handling of the skins of the several catches, that the skins of the
                            Alaska and Copper catches are readily distinguishable from each other,
                            and that the herds from which such skins are obtained do not, in fact,
                            intermingle with each other, because the skins classified under the head
                            of Copper catch are not found among the consignments of skins received
                            from the Alaska catch, and vice versa.</p>
                        <p>Sixth. Deponent further says that the distinction between the skins of
                            the several catches is so marked that, in his judgment, he would, for
                            instance, have had no difficulty, had there been included among 100,000
                            skins in the Alaska catch 1,000 skins of the Copper catch, in
                            distinguishing the 1,000 Copper skins and separating them from the
                            99,000 Alaska skins, or that any other person with equal or less
                            experience in the handling of skins would be equally able to distinguish
                            them. And in the same way deponent thinks from his own personal
                            experience in handling skins that he would have no difficulty whatever
                            in separating the skins of the northwest catch from the skins of the
                            Alaska catch, by reason of the fact that they are the skins almost
                            exclusively of females, and also that the fur upon the bearing female
                            seals is much thinner than upon the skin of the male seals—the skin of
                            the animal while pregnant being extended and the fur extended over a
                            large area.</p>
                        <p>Seventh. Deponent says that the number of persons who are employed in the
                            handling, dressing, dyeing, cutting, and manufacturing of seal skins in
                            the city of London is about 2,000, many of whom are skilled laborers,
                            earning as high as £3 or £4 a week. Deponent estimates the amount paid
                            in the city of London for wages in the preparation of fur-seal skins for
                            a manufacturer’s uses, and excluding the wages of manufacturers’
                            employees, prior to the beginning of the pelagic sealing in 1885, at
                            about £100,000 per annum; and deponent further says that in his
                            judgment, if this pelegic sealing be not prohibited it is a question of
                            but a few years, probably not more than three, when the industry will
                            cease by reason of the extermination of the <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161"
                                facs="0179"/>seals in the same way in which they have been
                            exterminated on the South Sea Islands by reason of no restrictions being
                            imposed upon their killing.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Henry Poland, being duly sworn, doth depose and say: That he is 40
                            years of age and a subject of Her Britannic Majesty; that he is the head
                            of the firm of P. R. Poland &amp; Son, doing business at 110 Queen
                            Victoria street, in the city of London, and has been engaged in that
                            business twenty-one years; that the said firm of P. R. Poland &amp; Son
                            are doing business as fur and skin merchants, and have been engaged in
                            that business for over one hundred years, having been founded by
                            deponent’s great-grandfather in the year 1785, and having been continued
                            without interruption since that date from father to son; that for many
                            years last past deponent’s said firm have been in the habit of buying
                            large numbers of fur-seal skins—in fact ever since skins of that
                            character have become an article of commerce—both on their own account
                            and on commission for other persons resident in the United States and
                            Canada and elsewhere; that by reason of having purchased so many skins
                            deponent has a general and substantial knowledge of the history of the
                            fur-seal skin business, and of the character and kinds of fur-seal skins
                            coming upon the London market; that from about the year 1879 down to the
                            present time the principal fur-seal skins coming to the London market
                            have, been what are known as the Alaska catch, being the skins of fur
                            seals killed upon the Pribilof Islands, in the Bering Sea; the Copper
                            Islands catch being the skins of fur seals killed upon the Kommandorski
                            and Robben Islands, of Russia, and what are known as the Northwest
                            catch. Until within two or three years ago a very considerable number of
                            skins also arrived on the London market, amounting perhaps to several
                            thousand annually, which were known as Japanese skins.</p>
                        <p>That the three classes of skins above mentioned are easily
                            distinguishable from each other by any person skilled in the business or
                            accustomed to handling skins in the raw state; that deponent has
                            personally handled the samples of the skins dealt in by this firm, and
                            would himself have no difficulty in distinguishing the skins of the
                            Copper Island catch from the skins of the Alaska and Northwest catch by
                            reason of the fact that in the raw state the Copper Island skins have a
                            lighter color and the fur is rather shorter in pile and of an inferior
                            quality. The skins of each of the three classes have different values
                            and command different prices in the market. Both the Copper Island skins
                            and the Alaska skins are almost exclusively the skins of male seals, and
                            the difference between the skin of a male seal and a female seal of
                            adult age can be as readily seen as between the skins of different sexes
                            of other animals. That the Northwest skins are, in turn, distinguishable
                            from the Copper Island and Alaska skins, first, by reason of the fact
                            that a very large proportion of the adult skins are obviously the skins
                            of female animals; second, because they are all pierced with the spear
                            or harpoon or shot, in consequence of being killed in open sea, and not,
                            as in the case of Copper Island and Alaska skins, being killed on land
                            by clubs; third, because the Northwest skins are cured upon vessels by
                            the crews of which they are killed, upon which there are not the same
                            facilities for flaying or salting the skins as there are upon land,
                            where the Copper and Alaska skins are flayed and salted.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese skins, which I think are now included in the Northwest
                            catch, are distinguishable from the other skins of the Northwest catch
                            by being yellower in color, having a much shorter pile, because they are
                            salted with fine salt, and have plenty of blubber on the pelt. That the
                            skins purchased by deponent’s firm are handed over by it to what are
                            called dressers and dyers for the purpose of being dressed and dyed. The
                            principal dressers and dyers of the city of London at the present time
                            are C. W. Martin &amp; Co. and George Rice, and skins are also dressed
                            and dyed by other persons. The fur-seal business has attained very
                            considerable dimensions in the city of London, large amounts of capital
                            being invested therein, and probably in and about the city of London
                            there are employed in the fur-seal skin business as many as 3,000
                            persons, most of whom are skilled hands, some of whom <pb n="162"
                                xml:id="pg_162" facs="0180"/>receive as high as £3 or £4 a week, and
                            many if not most of whom have families dependent upon them for support.
                            That the maintenance of this business necessarily depends upon the
                            preservation of the seal herds frequenting the northern Pacific regions
                            from being overtaken by the destruction which was the fate of the seals
                            formerly found in large quantities in the South Atlantic and South
                            Pacific Oceans.</p>
                        <p>That deponent is not in a position, by reason of possessing expert
                            knowledge or personal acquaintance of killing seals, to pronounce a
                            positive opinion as to what steps are necessary, if any, to accomplish
                            this result, but he would suppose it reasonable to say that a close
                            time, which should be universal in its application, for a specified
                            period in each year, during which the killing of seals should be
                            entirely prohibited, and the imposition of heavy penalties—say a fine of
                            £1,000—for any violation of the regulations providing for such close
                            time would be effective to preserve the herds referred to; and deponent
                            would under any circumstances increase the zone around the islands
                            containing the rookeries, within which sealing should be absolutely
                            prohibited, to a distance of 50 miles in every direction from the
                            shore.</p>

                            business he has a general and detailed knowledge of the history of the
                            business of dealing in fur-seal skins in the city of London, and of the
                            character and differences which distinguish the several kinds of skins
                            coming on the market; that for many years last past the fur-seal skins
                            coming On the London market have been known as, first, the Alaska catch,
                            which are the skins of seals killed upon the Pribilof Islands, situated
                            in the Bering Sea; second, the Copper Island catch, which are the skins
                            of seals killed on the Kommandorski and Robben Islands in the Russian
                            waters. The Robben Island skins were formerly separated from the
                            Kommandorski Islands, and were of inferior quality, and it is only
                            within the last eight or ten years that the Robben Island skins, which
                            are inconsiderable in number, have been presumably mingled with the
                            skins of seals caught on the Copper Islands and included in the term
                            “Copper catch.” Third, the Northwest catch, which are skins of seals
                            killed in the open Pacific or Bering Sea.</p>
                        <p>That the skins of these several catches are readily distinguished from
                            each other, and the skins of the different sexes may be as readily
                            distinguished from each other as the skins of the different sexes of any
                            other animal. I should estimate the proportion of female-skins included
                            within the Northwest catch at at least 75 per cent, and I should not be
                            surprised nor feel inclined to contradict an estimate of upward of 90
                            per cent. My sorter, who actually handles the skins, estimates the
                            number of female skins in the Northwest catch at 90 per cent.</p>
                        <p>One means of distinguishing the skins of the Northwest catch from those
                            of the other catches is the fact that they are pierced with shot or
                            spear holes, having been killed in the open sea, and not as in the case
                            of the Copper and Alaska catches, killed upon land, with clubs.</p>
                        <p>The differences between the Copper and Alaska skins are difficult to
                            describe so that they can be understood by any person who has no
                            practical knowledge of furs, but to anyone skilled in the business there
                            are apparent differences in color between the Copper and Alaska skins,
                            and a difference in the length and qualities of the hairs which compose
                            the fur, and there are also apparent slight differences in the shape of
                            the skins.</p>
                        <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0181"/>
                        <p>The differences between the skins of the three catches are so marked that
                            they have always been expressed in the different prices obtained for the
                            skins. I have attended the sales for many years, and am able to make
                            this statement from my own knowledge. The average prices obtained at the
                            sales of the last year’s catch, for instance, were as follows: For the
                            Alaska skins, 125 shillings per skin; for the Copper skins, 68 shillings
                            per skin, and for the Northwest skins, 53 shillings per skin.</p>
                        <p>That the skins purchased by the deponent are purchased on his own account
                            and on account of others resident in Canada and the United States and
                            the Continent, and he believes it is a fact that he is the largest
                            commission merchant in the fur business.</p>
                        <p>That the skins so purchased are consigned to various dressers and dyers,
                            the principal of whom are the firm of C. W. Martin &amp; Sons and George
                            Rice, and deponent himself is the landlord of a factory worked by
                            Frederick Smith &amp; Co., which is the oldest firm of dyers of fur-seal
                            skins, and of late years they have also become dressers.</p>
                        <p>That the fur-seal skin business had become an important industry in the
                            city of London in which a large amount of capital was invested and a
                            large number of workmen employed, amounting, including the dressers,
                            dyers, handlers, and persons employed in the manufactories of the
                            furriers, to about 3,000. It is difficult to make any correct estimate
                            of the number of people so employed, but deponent says that he has
                            recently had occasion to look into the question in his capacity as
                            master of the Skinners’ Company and he believes the above figures to be
                            substantially correct.</p>
                        <p>That a large number of persons so employed are skilled laborers, and most
                            of them have families dependent upon their labors for their support. The
                            wages paid in some cases are as high as £3 or £4 a week, and perhaps the
                            average wages of the whole number may be safely estimated at £1 per
                            week. That many of these persons know no other business than that in
                            which they are at present engaged.</p>
                        <p>That the continual existence of the fur-seal business is dependent, in
                            deponent’s judgment, upon the preservation of the seal herds frequenting
                            the Northern Pacific regions, and it is also a most important element in
                            the industry that the supply of seal skins coming to the market each
                            year should be regular and constant.</p>
                        <p>That deponent further says that some regulations are necessary for the
                            preservation of the seal herds frequenting the Northern Pacific region,
                            because it is a well-known fact that in the absence of any such
                            regulations the seal herds which were formerly found in the South
                            Atlantic and Pacific seas have been practically exterminated.</p>
                        <p>On the Lobos Island and in New Zealand governmental regulations exist,
                            and I am told, although I know nothing about it, that regulations of
                            some kind have been made in the colony of the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">general seal-skin industry</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Emil Teichmann, being duly sworn, doth depose as follows:</p>
                        <p>First. That he is 46 years of age, a native of the Kingdom of
                            Wurttemberg, and is now a naturalized subject of Her Britannic
                            Majesty.</p>
                        <p>That since the age of manhood he has been engaged in the fur business;
                            that from 1866 to 1868, inclusive, he resided in America in that
                            business, and since 1868 he has resided in England and done business in
                            the city of London, and is now and has continually been during all these
                            years engaged in one way or another in the fur business; that lie is now
                            a member of the firm of C. M. Lampson &amp; Co., and has been a member
                            of such firm for the period of twelve years last past; that prior to the
                            time he became a member of such firm and from the years 1873 to 1880 he
                            was a member of the firm of Martin &amp; Teichmann, who were then, and
                            its successors, C. W. Martin &amp; Sons, still are, the largest dressers
                            and dyers of seal skins in the world.</p>
                        <p>That the firm of C. M. Lampson &amp; Co., of which deponent has been as
                            aforesaid for the last twelve years a member, are what is known as
                            commission merchants <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0182"/>engaged in
                            the business of selling furs of various kinds and also in buying furs
                            upon commission.</p>
                        <p>That the said firm of C. M. Lampson &amp; Co., has, during the time that
                            deponent has been a member thereof, handled a larger number of skins of
                            the fur-seal than all the other firms in the world together, and
                            deponent knows from inspection of the books of his said firm that for
                            many years prior to the date when he became a member of the same they
                            also handled during many years previously thereto a larger number of
                            fur-seal skins than all the other firms in the world together.</p>
                        <p>That during the time deponent has been a member of the said firm he has
                            personally handled many hundreds of thousands of fur-seal skins, and he
                            has a detailed and expert knowledge of the various kinds of seal skins,
                            and the several differences between them which enable the several sorts
                            of seal skins to be distinguished from each other.</p>
                        <p>Second. Deponent says from his general knowledge of the business
                            inspection of the catalogues of sales of C. M. Lampson &amp; Co., and
                            from the information derived from his predecessors in the firm, the
                            chief of whom was the late Sir Curtis Lampson, who founded the house
                            about sixty years ago, that fur-seal skins were formerly obtained in
                            large numbers in the South Pacific and Atlantic seas, upon the San Juan
                            Fernandez and Falkland islands, upon Sandwich Island, South Shetland
                            Island, Desolation Island, Goughs Island, and Kerguelan and Massafuero
                            islands, and at Cape Horn.</p>
                        <p>There were also in former years a considerable number of skins obtained
                            from Russian possessions in the North Pacific Ocean through the medium
                            of a Russian company, as hereinafter stated.</p>
                        <p>The history of the Southern Atlantic and Pacific seal business shows that
                            at the localities above enumerated, and principally on South Shetland
                            and the Kerguelan islands, there must have been very large numbers of
                            seals. The principal market for the skins of such Southern Pacific and
                            Atlantic seals was, as deponent is informed, found in the Chinese ports,
                            and deponent has been informed and understands that in consequence of
                            the indiscriminate and universal killing of seals in the localities
                            above mentioned, where no restrictions of any kind were then or are
                            imposed upon the killing of seals at any time without regard to age or
                            sex, the seal rookeries in those localities were, after a few years of
                            such killing, practically exhausted.</p>
                        <p>That about twenty years ago the South Shetland Islands were again
                            visited, and for two or three years there were obtained from these
                            islands a considerable number of skins, amounting in the aggregate to
                            perhaps 50,000 skins. At the end of a three years’ catch of skins it was
                            reported that the rookeries were again exhausted, and the islands were
                            not again visited for several years, not until five years ago, when
                            deponent understands that a vessel was sent to those islands by the firm
                            of C. A. Williams &amp; Co., of New London, United States of America,
                            and that that vessel was only able to obtain 39 skins.</p>
                        <p>The time during which deponent has been in the business the skins from
                            all of the above-mentioned localities have been practically
                            infinitesimal in number.</p>
                        <p>Third. That for many years last past the skins of fur seals actually
                            coming into the markets of the world have been derived from the
                            following sources: <list>
                                <label>I.</label>
                                <item><hi rend="italic">The Lobos Islands shins</hi>, which are the
                                    skins of seals caught upon the islands of that name, situated
                                    off the river Platte and belonging to the Republic of Uruguay.
                                    These skins are consigned by the persons having the contract to
                                    take them with the Republic of Uruguay to Boulcher, Mortimer
                                    &amp; Co., of London, by whom they are sold through Goad, Rigg
                                    &amp; Co., and catalogues of the last-mentioned firm are
                                    published and have been inspected by deponent from time to time
                                    as published. The total number of skins derived from this
                                    source, as appears from an inspection of such catalogues, are
                                    during the years 1873 and 1892, inclusive, set forth accurately
                                    in the paper which is annexed hereto and marked “Exhibit
                                    A.”</item>

                                <item><hi rend="italic">Cape Horn skins.</hi>—Prior to the year 1876
                                    a small number of skins are supposed to have been obtained from
                                    this locality. They are not classified in our books or
                                    catalogues, nor in the books of any other persons or firms, so
                                    that they can not now, from examining the books and catalogues,
                                    be readily identified or separated from skins coming from other
                                    southern localities, but from the year 1876 down to the present
                                    time they have been so classified, and a large number have been
                                    sold by deponent’s firm. A statement of the skins obtained from
                                    Cape Horn is hereto appended and marked “Exhibit B.” The number
                                    of skins derived from this locality, as appears by that
                                    statement, fluctuated very largely in number, and I am informed
                                    that the reason for such fluctuation is that the seals from
                                    which the skins are obtained are killed mostly upon land, and
                                    that the weather in that part of the world is so severe that it

                                    small but steady number of skins have been obtained during many
                                    years last past. These skins are not consigned to deponent’s
                                    firm, but to other persons in London whose catalogues are
                                    published, and have been examined from time to time by deponent;
                                    and deponent is informed and believes from such examination of
                                    catalogues that the number of skins obtained from this source
                                    have been for the last few years about 5,000 per annum.</item>

                                    obtained are likewise killed mostly upon land, and he is also
                                    informed that some regulations for the protection of seal life
                                    at the Cape of Good Hope by regulating the killing of seals in

                        <p>Fourth. The history of the seal-skin fishery coming from the Northern
                            Pacific regions is briefly as follows:</p>
                        <p>In the early part of the century a Russian company was formed which
                            obtained from the Russian Government a right to kill seals, both upon
                            the Commander and Pribilof islands, and in and around the Bering Sea. Up
                            to the year 1853 about 20,000 skins were annually received in London
                            from the company in the parchment state. By the parchment state, I mean
                            skins which were dried with the top or water hair left on. They were
                            not, in consequence of this method of preservation by drying, in a
                            condition to be unhaired, and they were after having been dressed in
                            London largely returned to the Russian markets.</p>
                        <p>In the year 1853 a trial shipment of salted skins was made to J. M.
                            Oppenheim &amp; Co., in London, in pursuance, as deponent is informed,
                            of suggestions theretofore sent out by Messrs. Oppenheim that an attempt
                            should be made to salt the skins, but owing to the defective curing this
                            shipment was a failure. By degrees, however, the curing by means of
                            salting was improved, and in 1858 a contract was made by the
                            Russian-American Company to ship to Messrs. J. M. Oppenheim &amp; Co. an
                            annual supply of from 10,000 to 12,000 skins delivered in London at 10s.
                            10d. a skin. The quantity was increased in 1864 to 20,000 skins. This
                            contract remained in force until the Alaska Territory became the
                            property of the United States. In addition to the salted skins covered
                            by the contract last referred to, Messrs. Oppenheim &amp; Co. also
                            received during these years about 10,000 skins from the Russian-American
                            Company per annum, which were dried in the old-fashioned way and not
                            salted.</p>
                        <p>Deponent was connected with the firm of Messrs. J. M. Oppenheim &amp;
                            Co., at New York and London, from the years 1866 to 1872, inclusive, and
                            his late partner, Mr. Martin, and himself ultimately succeeded to the
                            business of Messrs. J. M. Oppenheim, so far as it related to the
                            dressing and dyeing of seal skins.</p>
                        <p>Upon the cession of Alaska to the United States there was indiscriminate
                            seal killing upon the Pribilof Islands for the season of 1869–1870.
                            About the end of that season the Alaska Commercial Company was formed at
                            San Francisco, as deponent is informed, by citizens of the United
                            States, for the purpose of obtaining a lease from the United States of
                            the right to kill seals on the Pribilof Islands.</p>
                        <p>This company did obtain from the United States an exclusive license to
                            kill seals on the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea for a period of
                            twenty years, under certain restrictions and regulations, which were, as
                            deponent is informed, set forth in the contract between that company and
                            the United States, and in extracts of Congress in relation thereto, and
                            in regulations of the Treasury Department of the United States made in
                            pursuance of such extracts of Congress.</p>
                        <p>A year ar two thereafter Messrs. Hutchinson, Kohl, Philippeus &amp; Co.,
                            of San Francisco, which, as deponent is, informed, was a firm formed by
                            persons controlling the Alaska Commercial Company, obtained a lease from
                            the Russian Government giving them the exclusive right to kill seals
                            upon Komandorski and Robben Islands.</p>
                        <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0184"/>
                        <p>That in 1890 the Alaska Commercial Company, as deponent was informed, did
                            not secure a renewal of the lease which they had theretofore enjoyed
                            from the United States, but a similar lease was granted by the United
                            States to the North American Commercial Company, which is a separate
                            corporation, and is controlled by different people from the Alaska
                            Commercial Company.</p>
                        <p>Fifth. From the year 1870 down to the present time deponent’s firm have
                            received and handled from the Alaska Commercial Company and from Messrs.
                            Hutchinson, Kohl, Philippeus &amp; Co., from the North American
                            Commercial Company, and the Russian Sealskin Company, of St. Petersburg,
                            which company have now succeeded to the lease of the Komandorski and
                            Robben Islands formerly enjoyed by Hutchinson, Kohl, Philippeus &amp;
                            Co., all the skins of seals which have been killed upon the Pribilof
                            Islands and upon the Copper Islands. They have also received at least
                            threefourths of the skins included in what is called the Northwest catch
                            until the year 1891, when the major part of the skins of, the catch were
                            consigned to Messrs. Culverwell, Brooks &amp; Co., of London. A large
                            number of the skins of this catch, amounting in one year to 40,000, have
                            been consigned to deponent’s firm by the firm Hermann Liebes &amp; Co.,
                            of San Francisco.</p>
                        <p>The total number of skins of the Northwest catch received by deponent’s
                            firm during the years 1872 and 1892, inclusive, are set forth with
                            accuracy in an affidavit made by my partner, Alfred Fraser, in New York,
                            a copy of which, dated April 1, and acknowledged, E. T. Rice, notary
                            public, has been received by me from him, and I annex hereto a copy of
                            the lists of Northwest skins attached to Mr. Fraser’s affidavit, making
                            the same a part of this deposition, and mark the same Exhibit C. I also
                            append hereto as a part of this deposition copies of the lists attached
                            to the affidavits of Mr. Fraser of Alaska skins sold in London by my
                            firm during the years 1870 to 1892, inclusive, and to the Copper Island
                            skins sold by my firm in London during the years 1872 to 1892,
                            inclusive, and mark the same, respectively, Exhibits D and E, and I
                            refer to the affidavit of Mr. Fraser, above mentioned, for an
                            explanation of all said lists and adopt the same explanation given by
                            him as my own. I have carefully verified the figures contained in these
                            latter and find them to be as accurate as any such statement can be
                            made.</p>
                        <p>Sixth. The skins of the Alaska and Copper catches are readily
                            distinguished from each other and command different prices in the
                            market, and I should have no difficulty and would undertake from my
                            knowledge of the various skins to separate Copper skins from Alaska
                            skins should they ever be found mingled together, as, however, they are
                            not. The Alaska and Copper skins are distinguishable from each other
                            partly by means of the different color. The Copper Island skins
                            generally have a darker top hair and are more yellow on the cheeks than
                            the Alaska skins. Perhaps a surer means of distinguishing the two is the
                            difference in shape. The Copper Island skins are much narrower at the
                            head than the Alaska skins, and this difference is very marked. In our
                            warehouses we have a different set of frames for the sizing out of the
                            Copper skins from those we use for the Alaska skins. Another difference
                            quite as important as the shape is that the fur upon Copper Island skins
                            is considerably shorter on the flanks and toward the tail than is the
                            fur of the Alaska skins. All of these differences are so marked, as I
                            have before stated, as to enable any expert or one familiar with the
                            handling of skins to readily distinguish Copper from Alaska skins, or
                            vice versa; but it is true in the case of very young animals the
                            differences are much less marked than in the case of the adult animal.
                            We receive practically no skins of very young animals from Alaska; but
                            we do receive at times a certain number of the skins of the young
                            animals from Copper. All the skins of both the Copper and Alaska catches
                            are the skins of the male animals.</p>
                        <p>Seventh. The skins of the Northwest catch are in turn readily
                            distinguishable from the skins of the Alaska as well as the Copper
                            catch. The differences which I have enumerated between the Copper and
                            Alaska skins are accentuated in distinguishing the skins of the
                            Northwest catch from the skins of the Copper catches, and we use a
                            separate set of frames or patterns in our business for the Northwest
                            skins from what we use for the Copper or Alaska skins. Among what are
                            classed by us as Northwest skins are included what are sometimes called
                            Japanese skins, which are the skins of seals killed on the northern
                            Asiatic coasts. These skins come upon the market generally by way of
                            Japan, but sometimes by way of San Francisco or Victoria.</p>
                        <p>The number of Japanese skins averages, deponent should say, about 5,000 a
                            year, although there is a good deal of fluctuation in the quantity from
                            year to year, and deponent says that, like the other skins included in
                            the Northwest catch, they are principally the skins of female seals, not
                            easily distinguishable from the skins taken from the herds frequenting
                            the eastern part of the Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, except by reason
                            of their being principally speared instead of shot.</p>
                        <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0185"/>
                        <p>The most essential difference Between the Northwest skins and the Alaska
                            and Copper catches is, that the Northwest skins, so far as they are
                            skins of adult seals, are almost exclusively the skins of female seals,
                            and are nearly always pierced with shot, bullet, or spear holes.</p>
                        <p>The skins of the adult female seal may be as readily distinguishable from
                            the skins of the adult male as the skins of the different sexes of other
                            animals; that practically the whole of the adult Northwest catch seals
                            were the skins of female seals; but the skins of the younger animals
                            included within this Northwest catch, of which we have at times a
                            considerable number, are much more difficult to separate into male and
                            female skins, and I am not prepared to say that I could distinguish the
                            male from the female skins of young animals.</p>
                        <p>A certain percentage of young animals is found among the consignments
                            received by us at the beginning of each season, which we understand and
                            are informed are the skins of seals caught in the Pacific Ocean off the
                            west coast of America; but a much smaller percentage of such small skins
                            is found among the consignments later in the season, which we are
                            informed are of seals caught in the Bering Sea.</p>
                        <p>I have been told that it is easier to catch the female seal at sea than
                            it is to catch the male seal, but I have no personal knowledge of that
                            point. I suppose, however, that there must be some foundation for the
                            statement, by reason of the fact that so small a proportion of male
                            adult seals are included in what is called the Northwest catch.</p>
                        <p>Eighth. Deponent says that what may be termed the fur-seal business has
                            largely been built up by the efforts of the Alaska Commercial Company,
                            the North American Commercial Company, and the firm of C. M. Lampson
                            &amp; Co.</p>
                        <p>That it depends to a considerable extent upon making seal skins an
                            article of fashion and of trade, and that a very large amount of capital
                            is invested in the Kingdom of Great Britain in the business.</p>
                        <p>It is, in deponent’s judgment, fair to estimate the amount of capital
                            invested in the business, in one way or another, to have been at times
                            as much as £1,000,000, and that there have been until lately dependent
                            upon this industry, in the city of London, about 2,000 skilled workmen,
                            most of whom have families dependent upon them for support; and the
                            amount of wages paid to those people deponent estimates on the average
                            at about 30 shillings per week, making an aggregate of £150,000 per
                            annum.</p>
                        <p>Deponent further says that the continuance of this business depends very
                            largely upon the maintenance of a steady and regular supply of fur-seal
                            skins in order that the trade may be able to calculate with approximate
                            certainty the number of skins which are to be received in each year.</p>
                        <p>Deponent further says that the maintenance of this business, to his mind,
                            obviously depends upon the preservation of the seal herds resorting to
                            Bering Sea from the destruction which has overtaken the seal herds which
                            were formerly found in the southern regions, and that whatever is
                            necessary to be done to preserving the seal herds in Bering Sea ought to
                            be done; but deponent, having no knowledge of the business of killing
                            seals, and having no scientific knowledge on the subject as a
                            naturalist, is not in a position to relate what laws or regulations, in
                            addition to those already existing, are necessary, if any such are
                            necessary, in order to accomplish this desirable result.</p>

                            American citizens.</p>
                        <p>The said schooner cleared from San Francisco on March 7, 1891, as is
                            claimed, on a fishing and hunting expedition to the North Pacific Ocean,
                            and was seized as above.</p>
                        <p>It is alleged that the master was obliged to sign a paper in the Russian

                            a written protest. It <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0186"/>is also

                            given, though the master of the ship often demanded one.</p>

                        <p>The schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was an American
                            vessel, owned by citizens of the United States, and carried the flag of
                            the United States. She sailed from San Francisco, Cal., March 7, 1891,
                            with her clearance and ship’s papers in proper and <pb n="169"
                                xml:id="pg_169" facs="0187"/>lawful form, with a full complement of
                            officers and men, destined for a cruise in the North Pacific Ocean on a
                            fishing and hunting expedition, with Alexander McLean as master, Joseph
                            McDonald as mate, 1 second mate, 1 cook, 1 cabin boy, 6 hunters, and 14
                            able-bodied seamen, well and sufficiently manned, victualed, and
                            furnished with all things necessary for a vessel in the merchant
                            service, and particularly for the voyage she was about to undertake.</p>
                        <p>Proceeding on her voyage, she arrived at Sand Point, Alaska, June 27,
                            1891, where she cast anchor and took in fresh water and supplies. On the
                            following day she proceeded on her voyage.</p>
                        <p>On July 4, 1891, she reached latitude 52° 30’ north, longitude 165° west;
                            July 9, latitude 50° W north, longitude 175° west; July 13, latitude 51°
                            W north, longitude 170° east; July 20, latitude 51° 35’ north, longitude
                            179° 10’ east; July 25, latitude 50° 15’ north, longitude 170° 20’ east;
                            July 28, latitude 50° 20’ north, longitude 170° 20’ east; July 30,
                            latitude 52° 40’ north, longitude 169° 20’ east; July 31, latitude 53°
                            10’ north, longitude 169° east; August 1, latitude 54° north, longitude
                            168° 10’ east; August 2, latitude 55° 35’ north, longitude 169° 20’
                            east, where she was seized, at 6 o’clock in the morning, by the Russian
                            war ship <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, being then about 20 miles distant
                            from and to the east of Copper Island, the nearest land.</p>
                        <p>The position of the schooner on the above days is verified by her log
                            book and ship’s journal, and attested by her officers and crew. By this
                            record we can trace the course of the vessel from the time of her
                            departure to her seizure, and can establish the correctness of the
                            delineation of her voyage by the testimony of the ship’s entire
                            company.</p>
                        <p>On examination of the route laid down in the log book it will be seen
                            that the schooner did not enter Russian waters until August 1, 1891, and
                            that she was seized at 6 o’clock on the following morning.</p>

                        <p>On August 2, 1891, the schooner having crossed into Russian waters the
                            day before, being then east of the sea boundary line, and within 20
                            miles of Copper Island, having decided on his return voyage to San
                            Francisco, the captain deemed it necessary to make the land in order to
                            test his chronometer. For this purpose he altered his course, standing
                            toward the land lying to the westward. He had taken no seals since
                            crossing the line that divides Russian and American waters; he had taken
                            none within the limits of Bering Sea. He had not touched land since he
                            left Sand Point, Alaska, on June 27. The seal skins on board the
                            schooner showed that they had been taken from seals shot in the water,
                            and that they had been taken more than forty hours before the seizure.
                            All this is attested by the captain, the mates, and the crew.</p>
                        <p>At 6 o’clock in the morning of August 2, 1891, the schooner was brought
                            to by a shot from the Russian war ship <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>. She
                            immediately hoisted the United States flag, and awaited the approach of
                            a boat from the Russian vessel. On its arrival a Russian officer came on
                            deck and demanded the schooner’s log book, which was given to him by
                            Captain McLean. The officer was also furnished with the ship’s papers,
                            issued by the customs officers in San Francisco in accordance with the
                            laws of the United States. The officer then proceeded to search the
                            vessel. Having completed his search, he returned to the man-of-war,
                            carrying with him the log book of the schooner, which he refused to give
                            up, and ordering the schooner to follow the war ship and await his
                            return.</p>
                        <p>The officer returned soon after, with an armed crew, and ordered Captain
                            McLean to leave his vessel and go aboard the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aleut</hi> with his ship’s company, except 7, who were to remain on
                            the schooner. This command the master refused to obey, for the avowed
                            and true reason that he had violated no law or regulation, and was not
                            subject to the orders of Russian officials. Thereupon he put his vessel
                            on her course, steering east.</p>
                        <p>The boat and armed crew returned to the man-of-war, which immediately
                            began maneuvering and fired four or five shots. Suddenly she crossed the
                            schooner’s bow from starboard to port; returning, she crossed bow of the
                            schooner from port to starboard, obviously intending to run her down. In
                            order to avoid a collision, the captain ordered the man at the wheel to
                            starboard to helm, but the man-of-war had approached so near that it was
                            impossible to get clear of her, and in the collision which followed the
                            schooner’s head gear was carried away. The vessels now being close
                            together, the man-of-war made lines fast to the schooner’s rigging. As
                            the <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0188"/>schooner was being dashed
                            against the war ship and in danger of serious damage, the mate was
                            ordered to cut the lines that held the vessels. This he attempted to do,
                            but the decks of the schooner were immediately crowded with armed men
                            who took possession of the vessel. Captain McLean and his men were then
                            taken on board the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, where he was informed
                            by her commander that he was a prisoner and that the schooner and cargo
                            were confiscated. He was surrounded by guards. When he inquired why his
                            vessel was seized, he was told by the Russian commander that he was in
                            Russian waters.</p>
                        <p>The captain of the schooner then entered his protest, claiming that the
                            seizure of the vessel and cargo and the arrest of the master and crew of
                            the schooner were illegal; that they were in neutral waters—on the high
                            seas—and not within 20 miles of land; that neither the captain nor any
                            of the ship’s men had touched land since they left Sand Point, Alaska,
                            on June 28, 1891; that all the seals on board had been taken in the
                            water on the high seas and killed with shotguns, as the skins on board
                            would show, and that no skins had been taken within forty hours of the
                            seizure.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III. <hi rend="italic">Events following the
                            seizure.</hi></p>
                        <p>At the time of said seizure the American flag was flying at the masthead
                            of said schooner, but shortly afterwards it was hauled down by the crew
                            of the Russian vessel, torn into shreds, thrown on the deck, and
                            trampled upon; and certain of the crew of said schooner picked up pieces
                            of said flag, and now hold the same as mementoes of the insult offered
                            to this great nation. The Russian flag afterwards floated at the
                            masthead of said schooner.</p>
                        <p>On August 3, 1891, said schooner and her crew were taken to Bering
                            Island. While at said island the Russians took from her 424 seal skins,
                            and subsequently delivered them to the company holding the Russian
                            lease. Said Russians also took from said schooner a large quantity of
                            stores and provisions, which were transferred to the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aleut</hi> and used thereon.</p>
                        <p>Said vessel and crew were then taken to Petropavlovski, at which place
                            the Russians took five of her boats and sold them. They also took the
                            guns, stores, and provisions of said schooner.</p>
                        <p>On or about August 8, 1891, the commander of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aleut</hi> prepared a paper in the Russian language and directed
                            the master of said schooner to sign the same, explaining that the paper
                            aforesaid was merely a notice of seizure. Said master protested against
                            this, but, on further insistence by said commander, he signed the same
                            and immediately filed a protest against any seizure of said schooner,
                            said master being under duress at the time of said signing. This protest
                            was handed to the commander aforesaid and attached to said notice of
                            seizure, but no copy of this alleged notice was ever given to the master
                            or crew of said schooner. Subsequently, the schooner and crew were taken
                            to Vladivostock.</p>
                        <p>The master and crew of said schooner were treated as prisoners from the
                            date of said seizure; but at the last-mentioned place they were allowed
                            to go ashore, but were told that they were under arrest and ordered to
                            report at police headquarters every day. Said master was also compelled
                            to sign a document which the Russian authorities claimed required him
                            not to leave port until further orders, but of the contents of which
                            said master is entirely ignorant, having signed the same under
                            duress.</p>
                        <p>During all this time no trial had been allowed said schooner, master, or
                            crew. They were told by the Russian authorities that they were to have a
                            trial in accordance with the forms of law, but after frequent requests
                            in this behalf said authorities told said master that there was no
                            necessity for such a course; and on or about October 10, 1891, the
                            authorities aforesaid informed him and his crew that they were at
                            liberty to leave. The master had been repeatedly informed while at
                            Vladivostock that he could gain his liberty by withdrawing his protest;
                            but this he invariably refused to do.</p>
                        <p>While at the last-mentioned place no quarters on board was furnished the
                            master or crew of said schooner; but shortly after their arrival the
                            master and mate were allowed 27 cents and the members of the crew 7½
                            cents per day. On this they could not subsist, and they were compelled
                            to sell a few of the clothes they had on their backs and to beg, having
                            to sleep in an old jail overrun with vermin and breeding pestilence.</p>
                        <p>After his release aforesaid, the master of said vessel went to Nagasaki
                            and thence to Yokohama, where he immediately filed with the American
                            consul a protest against said seizure.</p>
                        <p>Up to the time of their arrival at Vladivostock the mate and crew of said
                            schooner were compelled to work incessantly. No sleeping quarters or
                            rations were furnished <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0189"/>to them,
                            they being entirely dependent on the charity of the crew of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleut</hi> for the necessaries of life.</p>
                        <p>Said master and crew not only lost their vessel and all the property they
                            had on board, except a few necessary articles of wearing apparel, but in
                            consequence of the harsh and barbarous treatment received by them at the
                            hands of their captors during their imprisonment, they became and are
                            now emaciated in form, depressed in spirit, undermined in constitution,
                            and permanently injured in health.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Russia’s responsibility.</hi></p>
                        <p>This case does not involve the question of mare clausum. The right of
                            navigating the waters of Bering Sea by an American ship is assumed. The
                            navigation of those waters on both sides of the boundary line is
                            notoriously free to the merchant service of all nations.</p>
                        <p>This being so, it is not necessary to dispute or discuss any claims of
                            Russia to the exclusive ownership of the west half of Bering Sea or to
                            the extent of her dominion over its waters.</p>
                        <p>The right of the Imperial Government to prohibit foreign vessels from
                            taking fur seals within her boundary line beyond the 3-mile limit in the
                            adjudication of this case is not denied or questioned. On the other
                            hand, if these claimants were engaged in killing seals in Russian waters
                            it is conceded that their vessel would be liable to seizure, and,
                            together with her cargo, apparel, and furniture, be liable to
                            condemnation and confiscation by judgment of the proper court, in
                            accordance with international law and the laws of all civilized States,
                            and her officers and crew subjected to such penalties as said court
                            might inflict according to law. But if it be true, as the evidence shows
                            it is, that this vessel was quietly pursuing her voyage, and when 20
                            miles distant from the land, toward which she was sailing for a lawful
                            purpose, was wantonly arrested, against the protest of her captain, and
                            confiscated, together with her cargo and outfit, by a Russian war ship’s
                            officer, it is very plain that the act was unauthorized and that the
                            Russian Government is liable for the damage which the claimants have
                            sustained by reason thereof.</p>
                        <p>Your petitioners allege that said seizure, confiscation, and imprisonment
                            were illegal and in contravention of the treaties between the United
                            States and Russia, and that they have valid indemnity claims on account
                            thereof against the Russian Government for reasonable compensation and
                            damages as follows: <table rows="5" cols="2">

                        <p>Alexander McLean, being first duly sworn, deposes and says that he is a
                            resident of the city and county of San Francisco, State of California,
                            is a male white citizen of the age of 21 years and upward; that he is a
                            master mariner by profession, and was the late master of the schooner
                                <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, and was such master of
                            the said schooner at the time of the seizure of said schooner by the
                            Russian war vessel <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> on the 2d day of August,
                            1891; and further deposes that the last day that boats were lowered from
                            said schooner for sealing purposes, previous to said seizure, was on
                            July 30, 1891, and never had the boats of said schooner in the-water
                            after that up to the time of said seizure; that he had made no attempt
                            to seal on the morning of said 2d day of August; that the said schooner
                            had never been closer to Copper Island during the entire season than she
                            was at the time of said seizure; that there were 2 British vessels in
                            sight and in about the same position as said schooner at the time of
                            said seizure; that the last observation taken by said affiant was on the
                            30th day of July of said year, and that the weather was continuously
                            thick from said 30th day of July until early on the morning of the 2d
                            day of August, and that by reason of said thick weather he was obliged
                            to determine his position by means of dead reckoning; that Copper Island
                            was <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0190"/>sighted about 4 o’clock on
                            the morning of August 2, which he had been endeavoring to make in order
                            to get his position. At about 6 o’clock a.m. a steamer hove in sight on
                            the port quarter of said schooner, and soon afterwards came closer up.
                            Said steamer, which proved to be the Russian man-of-war <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, fired a gun, and said affiant, concluding
                            she wished to speak him, hove his vessel to and hoisted the American
                            flag; that the Russian steamer thereupon lowered a boat and sent an
                            officer and crew to board him; that said officer came on deck and
                            demanded the official log of the schooner, which was given him; that it
                            was not possible for said schooner, by her position the day before said
                            seizure, to have been any nearer the said island than said schooner was
                            at the time of said seizure; that said affiant stood no regular watch on
                            board said schooner; that he went below to turn in on the night of
                            August 1 at about 9. p.m., and went on deck on the morning of the 2d of
                            August at about 4 a.m. That said affiant ordered the officers in charge
                            of said schooner on the night of August 1 to steer north by east; that
                            no seals were taken by said affiant during said season of 1891 in Bering
                            Sea; that all seals that were taken by members of the crew of said
                            sealer during said season were taken in the Pacific Ocean; that the last
                            time that skins were salted down previous to the said seizure was on the
                            evening of the 30th day of July, 1891; that no seals whatever came
                            aboard said schooner subsequently to said 30th day of July; that no
                            seals were thrown overboard after the said 30th day of July; that at the
                            time said schooner was boarded by members of the crew of the Russian
                            gunboat at the time of said seizure said schooner was flying the
                            American flag at the masthead; that about twelve hours after the said
                            schooner was boarded by members of the crew of said Russian man-of-war
                            they hauled down the American flag, tore said flag in shreds, threw it
                            on the deck, and trampled upon it; that certain members of the crew of
                            said schooner afterwards picked up the pieces of said flag and now hold
                            the remnants of said flag in their possession as a memento of the insult
                            offered to the American flag; that the American flag was never hoisted
                            on said schooner again, but the Russian flag was hoisted before entering
                            port; that said schooner and her crew were taken to Bering Island on the
                            3d day of August, 1891; that Bering Island is merely a seal rookery and
                            that there is no tribunal thereon; that at Bering Island the Russians
                            took 424 seal skins from the said schooner and landed them, which seal
                            skins were subsequently delivered to the company holding the Russian
                            lease; that said Russians also took from said schooner a lot of stores
                            and provisions and put them on said gunboat <hi rend="italic"
                            >Aleut</hi>, and which were used on board of said <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aleut;</hi> that subsequently said schooner was sent to
                            Petropavlovsk; that said affiant was taken to said Petropavlovsk and was
                            there at the time of the arrival of said schooner; that after the
                            arrival of said schooner at said Petropavlovsk said Russians took from
                            said schooner 5 boats and sold them; also took from said schooner her
                            guns, stores, and provisions; that on or about the 8th day of August,
                            1891, the commander of the said <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> made out a
                            paper in the said Russian language which he asked affiant to sign, which
                            affiant declined to do, the said commander explaining said paper to be a
                            notice of seizure. Said commander further insisting that affiant should
                            sign said paper affiant, against his will, signed the same and
                            immediately thereafter filed a protest against any seizure of said
                            schooner and handed said protest to said commander of said <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, which protest affiant believes commander
                            attached to said notice of seizure; that no copy of said alleged notice
                            was ever given or offered to affiant by the Russian authorities, or by
                            anyone, or at all; that said schooner was subsequently sent to
                            Vladavistock, and arrived there on or about the 28th day of September,
                            1891; that affiant did not go with said schooner to Vladavistock, but
                            was ordered on board a man-of-war of the volunteer fleet and taken to
                            Vladavistock, where he arrived on the 28th day of September, 1891; that
                            affiant had been a prisoner from the days of the said seizure; that at
                            Vladavistock affiant was allowed to go on shore, but was told he was
                            under arrest and ordered to report at police headquarters every day,
                            which affiant did; that affiant was further compelled to sign a document
                            which the Russian authorities claimed was requiring said affiant not to
                            leave port until further orders; that affiant never had a trial at any
                            of the Russian ports, but was told by said authorities that he was to be
                            tried; but after affiant had repeatedly requested a trial the
                            authorities finally told him there was no necessity for a trial, and on
                            or about the 10th day of October said authorities said to affiant and
                            crew of said schooner that they could leave. Affiant was repeatedly told
                            while at Vladavistock that if he would withdraw the said protest they
                            would release him, which said affiant declined to do. That affiant
                            believes that the object of said authorities in detaining him was in the
                            hope that affiant would withdraw said protest in order that he might
                            gain his liberty. That no quarters or board were furnished affiant nor
                            the crew of said schooner while at Vladavistock; that each of the crew
                            were given 50 kopecks (about 27 cents) a day while at Vladavistock, but
                            the men could not live on that and were obliged to sell what clothes
                            they could <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0191"/>spare, and after
                            that begged for the necessities of life; that immediately after affiant
                            was released, together with the crew of said schooner, he left
                            Vladavistpck and went to Nagasaki and from Nagasaki to Yokohama, at
                            which last-named place, and immediately upon arrival, affiant filed with
                            the American consul his protest against the seizure of said schooner, as
                            aforesaid.</p>

                        <p>Joseph McDonald, being duly sworn, deposes and says: I have read the
                            foregoing affidavit of Alexander McLean relative to the seizure of the
                            schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> by the Russian war
                            ship <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, and know that the facts stated in
                            said affidavit are true; and further deposes and says that I was the
                            mate of the said schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> at
                            the time of her seizure on August 2, 1891; that I was taken from the
                            schooner on board the man-of-war as just I stood, and two days later,
                            upon our arrival at Bering Island, I was allowed to go with another man
                            on board of the schooner to procure my clothing and effects, but upon
                            going aboard the schooner found nothing there belonging to me of any
                            value, everything having been taken from the schooner. I immediately
                            reported to the Russian officer in charge of said schooner the fact of
                            the loss of my property, and I was informed by him to make out a list of
                            the articles missing, which I did, and handed the same to him, and he
                            said that he would report to the captain of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aleut</hi>. Immediately upon being taken aboard the man-of-war I
                            was set to work at ship’s work and was compelled to make the crew of the
                                <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> work also. I was given no hammock or
                            berth to sleep in. No rations were served out to me or the members of
                            the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi>, but we were obliged to eat
                            the crew’s rations—what they could spare of it—no extra allowance being
                            provided for us. The crew of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> were all
                            provided with hammocks, and I am positive there were extra hammocks on
                            board the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> that could have been served out
                            to us, I having seen them stowed below in the berth deck. We were
                            treated with indignities generally, and not with the same consideration
                            that the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> were treated. This
                            treatment was kept up until our arrival at Vladavistock, at which port
                            we were allowed to go ashore, and for the first two days no provision
                            was made for us, and being without money, were obliged to dispose of
                            what spare effects we had to obtain subsistence. After two days we were
                            allowed by the authorities 50 kopecks (about 27 cents) per day. We were
                            obliged to sleep on the floor of the police station or fire house until
                            the time of our departure, which was about six weeks later. We left for
                            Nagasaki on a Russian vessel, and were mixed in with a cargo of 300
                            Chinamen in the steerage.</p>
                        <p>Affiant further says that as a result of the ill-treatment while at
                            Vladavistock I contracted the smallpox and suffered with it for three
                            months and a half, the steward being also taken down with the same
                            disease and died from the effects of the same. We arrived in San
                            Francisco about the 21st of December, 1891, and was sent immediately to
                            the quarantine station at Angel Island, in the harbor of San Francisco,
                            and I was not released therefrom until about the 15th of March,
                            1892.</p>

                        <p>Albert Leslie Donaldson, being duly sworn, deposes and says: I have read
                            the foregoing affidavits of Alexander McLean and Joseph McDonald,
                            relative to the seizure of the schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi> by the Russian war ship <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, and
                            know that the facts stated in said affidavits are true.</p>
                        <p>I also was deprived of the greater part of my effects, including a gun
                            for hunting seals, rubber boots, a lamb’s-wool coat, shaving outfit,
                            etc. At Petropolauski we we were sent ashore and forced to live on 15
                            kopecks (about 7½ cents) per day, or go to work for the Government; not
                            being able to live on 7½ cents a day we were obliged and forced to work,
                            handling heavy timbers, loading lighters, scrubbing boots, and general
                            all-round work aboard of a vessel, for which we received a sailor’s
                            rations, and were allowed to sleep in an old house, which was used as a
                            jail. My treatment from the time of leaving Petropolauski until my
                            arrival at San Francisco was practically the same as related in the
                            affidavit of Joseph McDonald. I was also held in quarantine at San
                            Francisco from the time of my arrival, about the 21st day of December,
                            1891, until about the 5th day of January, 1892. My position aboard the
                            schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was that of officer
                            and hunter.</p>

                        <p>Oren Simons and Andrew C. Simons, being first duly sworn, each for
                            himself depose and say: That they have heard read the foregoing
                            affidavits of Alexander McLean, Joseph McDonald, and Albert Leslie
                            Donaldson relative to the seizure of the schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >James Hamilton Lewis</hi> by the Russian war ship <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aleut</hi>, and know that the facts stated in said affidavits are
                            true. We were both engaged as officers and hunters aboard the schooner
                                <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> at the time of the seizure. We lost the
                            greater part of our clothing and effects, including 3 guns, gunsmith’s
                            tools, etc., of the value of about $75, also an account book or wallet
                            containing about $8. While at Bering Island we, together with the
                            steward and 3 other sailors, were transferred to the schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">Lewis</hi> to help sail her to Petropolauski. After
                            arriving there our experience afterwards was practically the same as
                            related by McDonald and Donaldson in their affidavits. We also worked
                            the vessel from Petropolauski to Vladavistock. While at Vladavistock we
                            were obliged to sleep with Russian laborers on the floor, without
                            bedding or clothing, and the place was infected with vermin and in an
                            extremely filthy condition. We were quarantined with the rest of the
                            crew upon our arrival at San Francisco by reason of the smallpox
                            contracted by Mate McDonald and the steward, Frederick Grinsted, at
                            Vladavistock, for about fourteen days. The steward died while in
                            quarantine. While on the voyage from Bering Island to Vladavistock, in
                            conversing with the Russian officer in command of the schooner, Captain
                            Libideff, we were told by him that the schooner at the time of the
                            seizure was 33 miles off Copper Island.</p>

                            before me, the said consul-general, again comes the said Alexander

                            and state as follows, that is to say: That these appearers, on the 7th
                            day of March, 1891, in their capacities aforesaid, sailed in and with
                            the said <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> from the port of
                            San Francisco, in ballast, and bound to the North Pacific Ocean; that
                            the said ship was then tight, stanch, and strong; had her cargo well and
                            sufficiently stowed and secured; had her hatches well calked and
                            covered; was well and sufficiently manned, victualed, and furnished with
                            all things needful and necessary for a vessel in the merchant service,
                            and particularly for the voyage she was about to undertake; that nothing
                            happened worthy of note until the 2d day of August, 1891, at about 6
                            o’clock in the morning, 20 miles east of Copper Islands. Russian
                            men-of-war came and seized said vessel while she was on her way back to
                            San Francisco at said time. At about 5 o’clock a.m. saw 2 vessels on our
                            lee bow, wind northwest on port tack, which we steered for the other
                            vessels to speak them. About 6 a.m. a steamer reported on our port
                            quarter; shortly afterwards she came close up to us. Had her flag flying
                            and fixed a gun, so we concluded she wanted to speak us, so we hoisted
                            the American flag <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0194"/>and hove-to
                            for him; so they lowered a boat and crew and sent them to board us, and
                            officer came on deck and demanded the ship’s log book, which I gave
                            him—the ship’s official log book—and also showed him the vessel’s
                            official papers from the custom-house at San Francisco, Cal., which he
                            did not wish to see, but demanded to search the vessel, which I assisted
                            him to do so, as there was nothing on board that I wished to conceal, as
                            everything was on the ship’s manifest except what had been used on board
                            during the voyage. So he left the vessel, taking my official log book on
                            board of the Russian man-of-war <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, telling me
                            to wait until he returned, as he would have to follow the steamer; so I
                            told him to return my official log book. Shortly afterwards the officer
                            returned with an armed crew of men and demanded me to leave my vessel
                            and seven of my crew, which I refused, as I had done nothing wrong, and
                            I was not informed for what I was wanted on board of the man-of-war <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleut</hi>. So I considered it my duty to remain on
                            board of my vessel and proceed on my voyage as before to San Francisco,
                            Cal., and I put the vessel on her course, steering east, when, upon the
                            man-of-war boat returning to their ship, then they began to maneuver by
                            their boat going on one side and the steamer on the other, firing four
                            or five shots at us; then the man-of-war crossed our bow from starboard
                            to port and just missed running into us, and then she returned, and
                            crossing our bow from port to starboard, evidently intending to strike
                            us; when I saw her getting so close I wanted to avoid a collision, told
                            the man at the wheel to starboard the helm, but the man-of-war got too
                            close to us and it was impossible to clear her, and the schooner struck
                            her about midships, carrying away all our head gear, and the man-of-war
                            made lines fast to our rigging, and the two vessels were smashing
                            against one another. Then I told my mate to cut the lines that were
                            holding the vessels together and get them apart before they would break
                            up. The mate proceeded to do so by trying to cut the lines, when some of
                            the man-of-war’s men began shouting there was a man with a knife, and
                            was afraid he was going to kill some one. In the meantime the schooner’s
                            deck was crowded with Russian guns and bayonets, and all shouting at
                            once. Shortly afterwards we were all called on board of the man-of-war,
                            and the commander informed me that I was his prisoner, and the vessel
                            was seized, and I was surrounded by guards. Then I asked the commander
                            for his authority to seize me and make me his prisoner. His reply was
                            that I was in Russian waters. Then I protested that the seizure was
                            illegal, as I was in neutral waters of the high seas belonging to all
                            nations of the world, as I was outside of 20 miles of the nearest land.
                            Furthermore, none of the crew of the schooner had landed on any land
                            since they left Sand Point, Alaska, the 28th of June, 1891, and that all
                            the seals taken by me during the voyage were killed with shotguns on the
                            high seas and outside of all national limits, which could be proved by
                            examining the seal skins and see where they were shot, and the pup skins
                            that were found on board had been taken from the inside of the large
                            seals after they were taken on board of the vessel, and no seals had
                            been on the vessel’s deck for forty hours previous to the time of the
                            seizure; and the report made by the man-of-war <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aleut</hi> that they had seen something thrown overboard from the
                            schooner is wrong and mistaken, as their imagination must have deceived
                            them, as there had not been as much as a bucket of water thrown over the
                            side that morning.</p>
                        <p>And these said appearers, upon their oaths aforesaid, do further declare
                            and say: That during the said voyage they, together with the others of

                            said vessel and cargo from all manner of loss, damage, or injury.
                            Wherefore the said Alexander McLean, master, hath protested, as by these
                            presents I, the said consul-general, at his special instance and
                            request, do publicly and solemnly protest against all and every person
                            and persons whom it doth or may concern, and against the winds, and
                            waves, and billows of the seas, and against all and every accident,
                            matter, and thing had and met with as aforesaid, whereby and by reason
                            whereof the said vessel or her cargo has already, or hereafter shall
                            appear to have, suffered or sustained damage or injury; and do declare
                            that all losses, damages, costs, charges, and expenses that have
                            happened to the said vessel or her cargo, or to either, are and ought to
                            be borne by those to whom the same by right may appertain by way of
                            average or otherwise, the same having occurred as before mentioned, and
                            not by or through the insufficiency of the said vessel, her tackle or
                            apparel or default or neglect of this appearer, his officers, or any of
                            his mariners.</p>
                        <p>Thus done and protested in the port of Kanagawa, this 30th day of
                            November, A. D. 1891.</p>
                        <p>In testimony whereof these appearers have hereunto subscribed their
                            names, and I, the said consul-general, have granted to the said master

                            may require.</p>

                        <p>I, the undersigned, do hereby protest in behalf of the schooner <hi

                            the 2d day of August, 1891, upon the high seas and neutral waters of the
                            ocean. All seal skins on board of said vessel had been killed upon said
                            waters of the ocean with shotguns, and the pup skins on board were taken
                            from the inside of said seal after they were taken on board of the
                            vessel, and no seals were taken on board of the vessel for forty hours
                            previous to the said seizure. I therefore hold the Russian man-of-war
                                <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> and her Government responsible for the

                        <p>We, the undersigned, crew of the American schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, of San Francisco, Cal., do hereby
                            certify that this is a true and correct statement: That on the morning
                            of August 2, 1891, when 20 miles to the eastward of Copper Island, we
                            were standing in toward the land to test the chronometer before
                            proceeding on our voyage to San Francisco, and about 5 a.m. saw 2
                            vessels on our lee bow, wind northwest on the port tack, which we
                            steered for the other vessels to speak them. At about 6 a.m. a steamer
                            reported on our port quarter; shortly afterwards she came close up to
                            us, had her flag flying and fired a gun, so we concluded she wanted to
                            speak us, so we hoisted the American flag and hove to for her; so they
                            lowered a boat and crew and sent them to board us; and officer came on
                            deck and demanded the ship’s log book, which I gave him the ship’s
                            official log book, and also showed him ship’s official papers from the
                            custom-house at San Francisco, Cal., which he did not wish to see, but
                            demanded to search the vessel, which I assisted him in doing, as I had
                            nothing on board that I wished to conceal, as everything was on the
                            ship’s manifest, except what had been used on board during the voyage;
                            so he left the vessel, taking my official log book on board the Russian
                            man-of-war <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, telling me to wait until he
                            returned, as we would have to follow the steamer; so I told him to
                            return my official log book. Shortly afterwards the officer returned
                            with an armed crew of men and demanded me to leave my vessel and 7 of my
                            crew, which I refused to leave my vessel as I had done nothing wrong,
                            and I was not informed for what I was wanted on board the man-of-war <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, so I considered it my duty to remain on
                            board of my vessel and proceed as before on my voyage to San Francisco,
                            Cal., and I put my “vessel on her course, steering east, when upon the
                            man-of-war’s boat returning to their ship, then they began to maneuver,
                            the boat going on one side and the steamer on the other, firing four or
                            five shots at us; then the man-of-war crossed our bow from starboard to
                            port, and just missed running into us, and then she returned and
                            crossing our bow from port to starboard, evidently intending to strike
                            us; when I saw <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0202"/>her getting so
                            close, I wanted to avoid a collision and told the man at the wheel to
                            starboard the helm; so the man-of-war got too close to us, and it was
                            impossible to go clear of her when, as the schooner collided with her
                            about midships, carrying away all our headgear, and then the vessels
                            came close together, and the man-of-war made lines fast to our rigging
                            and the two vessels were smashing against one another; then I told my
                            mate to cut the lines that was holding the vessels together and get them
                            apart before they would break up. The mate proceeded to do so, by trying
                            to cut the lines, when some of the man-of-war’s men shouting there was a
                            man with a knife and was afraid he was going to cut some one; in the
                            meantime the schooner’s decks was crowded with Russians and guns and
                            bayonets, and all shouting at once; shortly afterwards we were called on
                            board of the man-of-war, and the commander informed me that I was his
                            prisoner, and the vessels and cargo confiscated, and I was surrounded by
                            guards; then I asked for why I was his prisoner and the vessel and cargo
                            seized, his reply being that I was in Russian waters; then I protested
                            that the seizure was illegal, as I was in neutral waters of the high
                            seas belonging to all nations of the world, as I was outside of 20 miles
                            of the nearest land; furthermore, none of the crew of the schooner had
                            landed on any land since they left Sand Point, Alaska, the 28th June,
                            1891, and all the seals taken by us during the voyage were killed with
                            shotguns on the high seas and outside of all national limits,” which
                            could be proved by examining the skins and see where they were shot, and
                            the pup skins that were found on board had been taken from the inside of
                            the large seal after they were taken on board of the vessel, and no
                            seals had been on the vessel’s deck for forty hours previous to the time
                            of the seizure; and the report made by the man-of-war <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aleut</hi> that they had seen something thrown overboard from the
                            schooner is wrong and mistaken, as their imagination must have deceived
                            them, as there was not as much as a bucket of water thrown over the side
                            that morning; so we, the crew of the schooner <hi rend="italic">J. H.
                                Lewis</hi>, do declare this to be a true statement, and insert our
                            signatures to the same.</p>

                        <p>The petition of the owners, captain and crew of the schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, captured by the Russian
                            ship of war <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> July 21 (August 2), 1891, a
                            petition presented in November, 1893, by the advocates, Jeffries &amp;
                            Earl, of Washington, to the Secretary of State of the United States of
                            America, containing an exposition of the facts relating to the said
                            capture, which is considered to have been illegal, even asking the
                            intervention of the Government of the United States with a view to
                            obtaining from the Russian Government indemnity, both for the capture
                            itself and for the arrest of the captain and crew of the schooner and
                            for the bad treatment which they should prove on the part of the
                            Imperial authorities.</p>
                        <p>The exposition of facts is divided into several heads, as follows: First,
                            voyage of the vessel; second, the capture; third, facts after the
                            capture. It is supported by the following documents, to which are
                            annexed in copy to the petition addressed to the Secretary of State: 1.
                            An act of protest of Alexander MacLeen, captain of the schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, against the capture of that
                            vessel; an act drawn up and delivered to MacLeen the 30th of November,
                            1891, by Mr. W. D. Tillodson, consul-general of the United States at
                            Kanagawa (Japan). 2. The depositions on the subject of the captain,
                            MacLeen, and of four men of the crew, made January 13, 1893, before the
                            deputy of the court of the district of San Francisco. 3. The log book
                            containing data of the voyage of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis.</hi></p>
                        <p>The petition above mentioned addressed to the Secretary of State of the
                            United States includes among other things the following considerations,
                            formulated by the advocates under the title of “Responsibility of
                            Russia.” The present case does not at all bring up the question of the
                            closed sea (mare clausum). The right of American vessels to navigate in
                            Bering Sea is self understood. From both sides of the line of
                            delimitation these waters are open to the vessels of commerce of all
                            countries. That being admitted there can be no dispute or discussion,
                            whatever pretention Russia may make to an exclusive sovereignty over the
                            eastern part of Bering Sea or to the extension of her domination over
                            the waters in question.</p>
                        <p>“The right of the Imperial Government to interdict to foreign vessels the
                            hunting of seals on this side of its maritime frontier to a distance
                            from the lower coast of 3 miles is not at all contested nor brought in
                            question. If the plaintiffs had been surprised killing seals in Russian
                            waters we concede that their vessels would have been liable to capture,
                            and that they would have been, with their cargo, rigging, and apparatus,
                            subject to capture and confiscation by sentence of a competent tribunal,
                            in accordance with international law and the laws of all civilized
                            nations, while the officers and crew would have been liable to such
                            penalties as said tribunal might have lawfully inflicted on them. But,
                            on the other hand, if it is established, as the evidence seems to show,
                            that the vessel in question was quietly pursuing its voyage and that she
                            was at a distance of 20 miles from the coast, toward which she was
                            proceeding with a legitimate object, she was irregularly seized, in
                            spite of the protests of her captain, and confiscated, with cargo and
                            apparatus, by an officer of the Russian ship of war, it is clear that it
                            was an arbitrary act and one which the Russian Government is responsible
                            for, for the prejudice which the plaintiffs have suffered by that
                            act.”</p>
                        <p>The plaintiffs conclude by affirming that the capture, confiscation, and
                            imprisonment in question having been illegal and in contravention to the
                            existing treaties between Russia and the United States, they have based
                            a claim against the Russian Government for a just indemnity estimated as

                        <p>The substance of the documents annexed in copy to the petition is as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>1. The protest signed at Kanagawa by Captain MacLeen and 4 men of his
                            crew states the facts as follows: At 6 o’clock in the morning, when the
                            schooner was at a distance of 20 miles to the west of Copper Island, a
                            Russian ship of war approached it on the starboard side, with flag
                            raised, and fired a cannon shot. Understanding that it wished to speak
                            with him, the American flag was hoisted on the schooner, and she was
                            hove to. A boat was then lowered from the ship of war and boarded the
                            schooner. The officer who came on board with his crew demanded the log
                            book, <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0206"/>which was given him, and
                            he asked to examine the vessel. The captain assisted in this, the
                            schooner containing nothing which he wished to conceal. Then the officer
                            left the schooner, taking with him the official log book, although the
                            captain requested him to leave it on board. In putting off the officer
                            declared that the schooner would have to follow the ship of war. Soon he
                            returned in his boat with a detachment of armed marines and demanded
                            that the captain and 7 men should leave the vessel. MacLeen refused,
                            believing it his duty to remain on board, and undertook to put the
                            schooner on her easterly course, followed on one side by the boat and on
                            the other by the ship of war, which, after firing four or five cannon
                            shots, began to sail around her from starboard to port, and then from
                            port to starboard. Seeing himself very closely pressed by the ship, the
                            captain of the schooner tacked to starboard. In executing this maneuvre
                            the vessel fouled the ship of war and lost her jib boom in the
                            collision. Meantime the ship of war attached her cables to the rigging
                            of the schooner. The captain ordered these cut loose, but the execution
                            of this order was hardly commenced when the Russian armed marines
                            boarded the schooner and MacLeen was ordered on board the ship of war,
                            the commandant of which declared that his vessel was captured. The
                            captain of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> having
                            demanded by what right the capture was made, the commandant answered him
                            that the schooner had been taken in Russian waters. MacLeen protested,
                            stating that he was in an open sea, the waters of which belonged to all
                            nations, and at more than 20 miles from the nearest point of land. He
                            added that since the 28th of June of that year no one of the crew had
                            gone ashore, that all the seals found on the schooner had been killed by
                            gunshots on the open sea, and that the skins of the young seals
                            preserved on board came from animals taken from the bellies of their
                            mothers after these had been brought on board the vessel.</p>
                        <p>2. In his subsequent deposition at San Francisco on January 13, 1893—that
                            is to say, one year and five months after the capture—Captain MacLeen
                            added, among other things, what follows, to his former declaration
                            received by the United States consul at Kanagawa. On August 2 he had
                            made no attempt to hunt seals. The last dispatch of boats for the
                            purpose of hunting dated back to July 3. During the entire season the
                            schooner had never been nearer to Copper Island than at the time of her
                            capture. Her last observations had been made July 30. The weather being
                            foggy she was obliged to determine her position and to this end tried to
                            see Copper Island which she made out August 2 at 4 o’clock in the
                            morning. The seals found on board had not been taken in Bering Sea, but
                            in the Pacific Ocean. Skins had not been salted since July 30. The
                            Russian marines who boarded the schooner had pulled down the American
                            flag, which they had torn in pieces and trodden under foot. On August 3,
                            the schooner and her crew had been brought to Bering Island. There, the
                            Russians had taken 424 skins, carrying them ashore, while part of the
                            provisions were taken on board the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>. Then
                            the schooner was sent to Petropavlovsk, where the Russians had taken
                            away and sold five boats belonging to the <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamiltor Lewis</hi>. August 8, the commandant of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleut</hi> brought MacLeen a document in the Russian
                            language, saying to him that it was the act of seizure, and insisting
                            that he should sign it, which MacLeen only did under constraint. He
                            immediately drew up a protest against the said seizure, a document which
                            he gave to the commandant of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, who
                            annexed the protest to the act of seizure, no copy of which was given to
                            the captain of the schooner. September 2, the <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis</hi> was sen to Vladivostok, where MacLeen was also
                            sent on board a vessel of the national fleet. He arrived there September
                            28. The day of the seizure the captain of the <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis</hi> had been placed under arrest. At Vladivostok he
                            was permitted to go on shore on condition of presenting himself every
                            day at the police office. He observed this order, demanding many times
                            to be arraigned before a tribunal. The authorities positively declared
                            to him that there was no need for him to be placed under judgment, and
                            on October 10 the captain and crew of the schooner were informed that
                            they could go free. Neither he nor his men had been lodged or nourished
                            during their stay at Vladivostok. The latter had received 50 kopecks a
                            day, but this sum being insufficient to support them, they had been
                            obliged first to sell such clothing as they could spare and after this
                            to beg for a living. As soon as Captain MacLeen was put at liberty with
                            his crew he left Vladivostok and went to Nagasaki, where he hastened to
                            make a protest before the consul against the seizure of his vessel.</p>
                        <p>The deposition of Captain MacLeen was confirmed by 4 men of the crew of
                            the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, as follows: The mate of
                            the schooner <hi rend="italic">MacDonald</hi> as well as Albert
                            Donaldson, Oren Simons, and Andrew C. Simons, calling themselves hunters
                            and attached to the service of the schooner. They have, moreover,
                            declared as follows:</p>
                        <p>MacDonald deposed that he had been taken on board the ship of war
                            immediately after the capture of the schooner. Two days after his
                            arrival at Bering Island he <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0207"/>was
                            permitted, with another man of the crew, to go aboard the schooner to
                            get his clothes and effects, but everything of value had disappeared. He
                            at once reported this to the Russian officer on guard on the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, who told him to draw up a
                            list of the articles which were missing and promised to report it to the
                            commander of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> On this latter ship
                            MacDonald was pressed into the service on board without receiving any
                            other food than that which was furnished to the sailors of the crew. Two
                            days after his arrival at Vladivostok 50 kopecks a day was given to him
                            for his support, and with the other men of the schooner he was obliged
                            to sleep on the ground at the pumping station. Resulting from this bad
                            treatment he had caught smallpox and was sick for three months and a
                            half.</p>
                        <p>The deposition of Albert Donaldson states that at Petropavlovsk they were
                            sent ashore, where they received 15 kopecks a day for subsistence, which
                            obliged them in order to live to work hard.</p>
                        <p>According to the joint declaration of Oren and Andrew C. Simons these two
                            men lost the greater part of their effects, which they value at $75, as
                            well as an account book or portfolio containing $8. At Vladivostok they
                            were obliged to sleep on planks with the laborers. They furthermore
                            declare that during the passage from Bering Island to Vladivostok the
                            Russian officer stated to the commandant of the <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis</hi> that the latter had been seized 33 miles from
                            Copper Island.</p>
                        <p>3. The papers in the case contain, moreover, a copy of the log book in
                            which is a list of the crew and the notes of the voyage of the schooner,
                            to which is also annexed a copy of the protest given August 12 by the

                            extract of the log of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, documents sent
                            by the commander of Vladivostok, with a report dated September 23, 1894,
                            and received December 8 of the same year, present the facts in question
                            as follows:</p>
                        <p>The schooner <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> was on July 21/August 2, 1891,
                            at 4.40 in the morning to the west of Copper Island, about 3 miles to
                            the north of its southern extremity, when a sailing schooner was
                            sighted. It was ahead of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, followed a
                            northwest course, and was approaching the island. The <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aleut</hi> headed for her to pay her a visit, which the schooner
                            seeing went about and crowded on all sail. During the pursuit the crew
                            of the sailing schooner were seen from the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>
                            to throw something overboard. At 5.15 o’clock, at 12 miles from the
                            southern extremity of Copper Island, the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>
                            overhauled the schooner and fired a blank shot, on which the latter
                            vessel hoisted the American flag and came to. Two officers sent to visit
                            her reported on their return that the vessel was from San Francisco and
                            carried the name of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>.
                            They had found on board 6 small whaleboats, a great quantity of salt,
                            guns, cartridges, powder, and bullets, together with some long poles of
                            bamboo with iron points, furnished with cord and rings to drag wounded
                            seals out of the water. On being interrogated the captain of the
                            schooner stated that he had come into those waters to hunt birds and to
                            fish. He at first affirmed that the number of the crew was 25 men. Then
                            he reduced the number to 22, adding that 5 of them were absent. In fact,
                            the schooner only contained 17 men, including the captain. The journal
                            which he produced, under the name of the official log book for 1891,
                            only contained three entries, two of which related to incidents of the
                            life on board and the third stated that the schooner had been visited in
                            the neighborhood of Sand Pocus, Alaska, by the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Thetis</hi> of the United States war fleet. There was further noted
                            some account of the schooner and her sailors. As to the notes of time
                            and place relative to the voyage of the vessel the journal contained
                            nothing.</p>
                        <p>Although this first visit did not reveal any salted skins of seals or
                            otters, everything else showed, nevertheless, that one had to deal with
                            a schooner poaching in our waters, and probably also on our shores, if
                            occasion offered. In consequence, the commandant of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleut</hi> ordered Lieutenant Lebedeff to take with
                            him 6 men to go aboard the schooner, make the seizure, send the captain
                            and half the crew on board the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, and then
                            bring the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> to Nikolskoe. When
                            these orders were brought to the knowledge of the captain of the sailing
                            vessel, he peremptorily refused to submit to them, stating that if the
                            commandant of the ship of war needed to see him he could come to him.
                            Thereupon he resumed his course and continued to sail with the wind.
                            Seeing the schooner standing away while a light fog began to spring up,
                            the commandant of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> gave chase.
                            Overhauling him he demanded that he come to, and supported his words by
                            firing a shot over his bow. There was no response, and the schooner
                            continued her course. The <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> permitted her to
                            pass, then overhauled her again, taking her on the other side, and
                            pressing closer to her this time. The commandant repeated his order to
                            come to and again <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0208"/>supported it
                            with a shot fired against the forward sails. To the verbal summons the
                            captain answered some words, indicating the American flag. To the cannon
                            shot, which pierced the jib, he paid no attention. Then the <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleut</hi> increased her speed and barred the passage
                            of the schooner, which fouled her on the starboard side. The shock broke
                            the jib boom of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> and
                            damaged the taffrail, as well as the after corner of the poop of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, which, having forced the schooner to stop,
                            took her in tow. The captain of the schooner, MacLeen, as well as her
                            crew, were brought on board the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> and were
                            informed that their vessel was seized and would be brought to Nikolskoe,
                            situated on Bering Island.</p>
                        <p>During the tow the schooner was subjected to a careful examination. Four
                            hundred and twenty-four seal skins, one line for fishing for otters, and
                            two skins taken from seals which, estimating their ages and following
                            the estimates of the chief of the arrondissement of the Commander
                            Islands, could only have been killed on shore. On arrival at Nikolskoe
                            the captain of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> had to
                            deliver the documents of the vessel, and he was notified that his
                            schooner was considered to be a prize for having been engaged in
                            forbidden and illegal hunting, and that he was to be taken to
                            Vladivostok in accordance with orders that crews of vessels of that
                            category having been guilty of resistance should be brought to that
                            port. Now, there had been resistance from the fact of the refusal of
                            Captain MacLeen to come to on receipt of the order to do so.
                            Consequently the commandant of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>
                            proceeded to arrest the captain of the schooner and her crew. An act was
                            drawn up, signed by the Commandant Brandt and by the officers, as well
                            as by the Captain MacLeen. The latter wrote on the back of this document
                            the following protest, expressed in English:</p>
                        <p>“I, the undersigned, hereby protest, in the name of the schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> and her owners, against the
                            illegal seizure of the said vessel, her rigging, cargo, and apparatus
                            for hunting and fishing found on her, a seizure effected by the Russian
                            ship of war <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> August 2, 1891, in the open
                            sea, in the neutral waters of the Ocean. All the seal skins found on
                            board the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> came from animals
                            killed by gunshots in the said waters of the ocean. As to the skins of
                            young seals which form part (of the above), they were taken from animals
                            drawn from the bellies of their mothers taken on board. No seal had been
                            taken within the forty hours preceding the said seizure. In consequence,
                            I hold the Russian ship of war <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> and her
                            Government responsible for this detention, as well as for the damages
                            caused by the illegal seizure of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi>, her cargo, and the apparatus found on her.”</p>
                        <p>The captured vessel was then prepared, by order of the commandant of the
                                <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, to be taken to Petropavlovsk.
                            Lieutenant Lebedeff, Ensign Engmann, 2 quartermasters, and 7 sailors,
                            with 6 men from the crew of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi>, were designated to bring her. All the skins found on
                            board of the schooner were, by order of the commandant, Brandt, sent
                            against receipt to the chief of the arrondissement of the Commander
                            Islands, to be sent to London and sold for the account of the
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The 24th of July the captured schooner weighed anchor for her
                            destination, Petropavlovsk, where the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> found
                            her, arriving on the 27th of the same month. The captain and 10 men of
                            the crew of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> were sent by
                            order of the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> on board the
                            steamer <hi rend="italic">Vladivostok</hi> of the national fleet, and 6
                            others left on board of their vessel. August 17 the latter was sent on
                            to Vladivostok.</p>
                        <p>In the report which he presented to the commandant of Vladivostok, dated
                            October 20, 1891, the commandant of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>
                            stated, among other things, that his ship was, on the 21st of July, in
                            the morning, near the southern point of Copper Island, at the moment
                            when the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was perceived. The
                            distinctness with which her sails could be seen did not permit of the
                            distance which separated the two vessels to be estimated at more than 6
                            miles. It follows that the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>
                            was distant 6 miles at most from the southern point of Copper Island.
                            The schooner was heading toward the shore, but as soon as she perceived
                            the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> she went about and put on all sail. She
                            was overtaken at 13 miles from the point from which she had been first
                            seen, at 11 miles from the southern point of Copper Island.</p>
                        <p>On arrival at Vladivostok of the documents collected, on board the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, it proved that the most
                            important, namely the journal of the vessel, serving among other things
                            to note daily the geographical position of the ship, was not among the
                            number. It was replaced by a book not at all filling those conditions,
                            although it was entitled “official log book,” with mention that it has
                            been delivered by the Treasury Department of the United States.</p>
                        <p>On examination of the present affair to the bottom, it appears to rest
                            upon the following considerations:</p>
                        <p>As soon as the schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, seen
                            July 21/August 2, 1891, by the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> at 3 miles
                            to the north of the southern extremity of Copper Island, noticed <pb
                                n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0209"/>that our ship of war was headed
                            for her, she changed her course and stood away under all sail from the
                            island in question. At the same time some objects were thrown overboard
                            into the sea. When, after a pursuit of an hour and a half, the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was overhauled, a great
                            quantity of firearms, powder, apparatus for dragging killed seals from
                            the water, seal skins, and among them two skins of young seals which
                            could only have been killed on shore. This assemblage of facts gave to
                            the commandant of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> sufficient basis for
                            declaring the captured vessel subject to prize, as engaged in illegal
                            and forbidden hunting in Russian waters. All the preceding recital of
                            circumstances preceding or following the arrest of the schooner are
                            confirmed by the protocol of seizure and by the entries in the log book
                            of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> The captain of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >James Hamilton Lewis</hi> has only set up his simple allegation,
                            without supporting evidence, recorded in his protest, and stating that
                            the sealskins found on board his vessel came from animals killed by
                            gunshots at sea, and that no seal had been taken within forty hours
                            before the capture. Now, it lay entirely with the said captain to
                            present, at the time of the arrest of the schooner, a journal of the
                            vessel, the tenor of which from day to day would have left no doubt and
                            which would have served to establish in a convincing and irrefutable
                            manner the movements of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>
                            up to the moment of arrest. Whether such a journal was or was not kept
                            on board the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, it is certain
                            that it was not given to the commandant of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aleut</hi>, who claimed it at the time of the capture. In place of
                            this the captain of the American schooner gave him, according to his own
                            protest before the United States consul at Kanagawa, a book which, in
                            spite of its title, Official Log Book, did not at all fill those
                            conditions. This being admitted, the extract from the journal of the
                            vessel presented by the claimants in November, 1893—that is to say, two
                            years after the seizure—could not have the character of evidence in
                            support of the assertions it is intended to corroborate. There is
                            nothing to show that the entries it contains are accurate, having been
                            made at the time; and one is even justified in doubting its
                            authenticity.</p>
                        <p>The declaration of the Captain MacLeen at the moment of his arrest should
                            not be lost sight of when he explained his presence at the place where
                            that arrest took place, by the design of fishing and hunting birds,
                            passing in silence hunting of seals. Now, in searching the schooner no
                            birds nor fish were discovered, but only seal skins and apparatus for
                            hunting those animals.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the depositions made by Captain MacLeen and some of the
                            men of his crew before the deputy of the court of the district of San
                            Francisco on the subject of the bad treatment which they received from
                            the Imperial authorities, these are mere assertions, unsupported by
                            evidence, and deserve no credence. The reports submitted on the subject
                            of the present affair contain no statements in this regard, whence the
                            conclusion is justifiable that the claimants never presented any
                            complaint of that nature to our authorities at Petropavlovsk.</p>
                        <p>By reason of what precedes, and considering that the statements furnished
                            by the plaintiffs on the subject of the present affair are bare of
                            evidence worthy of belief, I declare regular the provisions taken by
                            Second Captain Brandt, commanding the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>,
                            concerning the arrest and seizure of the American schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>. In consequence I give
                            notice that the demand for indemnity brought by the owners, captain, and
                            crew of the said vessel should not be taken into consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I received Acting Secretary W. W.
                            Rockhill’s letter of August 20, 1896, inclosing a copy of correspondence
                            from the legation at St. Petersburg, No. 340, July 3, 1896, also a copy
                            of a memorandum from the Imperial ministry of marine, relative to the
                            seizure of the American schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi> by the Russian man-of-war <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>
                            August 2, 1891.</p>
                        <p>The delay in replying was due to my absence from the city and difficulty
                            of obtaining additional evidence, owing to the absence from the port of
                            San Francisco of Captain MacLean and his crew, I have, however, received
                            the original log book <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0210"/>with
                            captain’s affidavit attached, also affidavits of Albert L. Donaldson and
                            A. C. Simons, two of the hunters on the <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> at
                            the time she was illegally seized, they being the only two in the port
                            at the present time, which affidavits I herewith inclose.</p>
                        <p>They are directly to the point that the seal pups assumed by the Russian
                            authorities to have been taken on land were not so taken, but were from
                            the bodies of cows captured at sea, which, according to their
                            experience, extending over a period of about ten years, is an everyday
                            occurrence.</p>
                        <p>They, together with the master, contradict the assertion of the Russian
                            authorities that something was cast overboard from the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Lewis</hi> after sighting the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, as well
                            as testify to the authenticity of the log book herewith submitted.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as the Russian Government discredit the authenticity of the log
                            book, I thought it well to send the original, containing the signatures
                            of the crew, made at Vladiovostock. Since—the voyage being broken up—the
                            crew necessarily separated after leaving Valdiovostock, their signatures
                            to the log is strong corroborative evidence of the fact, testified to by
                            Donaldson, Simons, and the master, that the log was in its present
                            complete condition before they left that place. This ought to set at
                            rest any doubt as to its authenticity in any fair and dispassionate
                            mind.</p>
                        <p>It is, however, urged by the Russian Government that the master failed to
                            deliver this book to the seizing officer when this log was demanded, and
                            that the “official log” actually delivered has no entry of the vessel’s
                            positions.</p>
                        <p>As to the entries in the “official log,” a superficial inspection would
                            have disclosed on page 3 a copy of sections 4290–4292 of the Revised
                            Statutes of the United States, which provide what matter shall be
                            entered in such log. Matters relating to the navigation of the vessel
                            are not among those enumerated, and are never so entered.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the failure of the master to surrender the log herewith
                            inclosed, it appears to me to have been eminently wise on his part, in
                            view of the fact that his vessel has been confiscated without being
                            given the opportunity of a defense in a court of justice. That book was
                            a record necessary to prove the master’s innocence, and was kept for
                            that purpose in case of a trial, when it would no doubt have been
                            produced. No trial being granted, it is but reasonable to suppose that
                            had this record been delivered to the seizing officer, it would have
                            been lost sight of with as little ceremony as was observed in the
                            confiscation.</p>
                        <p>The attitude of the Russian Government toward the depositions offered in
                            evidence is somewhat unfortunate, they being characterized as “mere
                            assertions unsupported by evidence, and deserve no credence.” What is to
                            be considered as evidence and what not, and why this particular evidence
                            “deserve no credence,” are matters left unexplained. What better
                            evidence would be obtained than the direct testimony of the parties
                            themselves?</p>
                        <p>Equally unfortunate is the assertion that Captain McLean, at the time of
                            his arrest, “explained his presence in that place where the arrest took
                            place by the intention of fishing and hunting birds, passing in silence
                            over hunting of seals.”</p>
                        <p>To a person of ordinary experience in affairs it would scarcely require
                            the denial of the master, contained in his affidavit, herewith inclosed,
                            to discredit this assertion, for it would be a person of exceedingly
                            weak understanding who would offer such an explanation of his presence
                            in those grounds, with seal skins and all the paraphernalia for sealing
                            on board. Whatever may be otherwise affirmed of Captain McLean, he
                            certainly is not such a person.</p>
                        <p>The assertion “that some objects were thrown overboard into the sea” is
                            also directly denied by the three affidavits herewith inclosed. The
                            Russian Government does not even vouchsafe a suggestion as to what those
                            objects may have been, leaving the whole matter to inference.</p>
                        <p>Of course, the treatment which the Russians are alleged to have accorded
                            the American flag is not a matter of private concern, and can have no
                            direct bearing upon the merits of this case; but we would, under
                            ordinary circumstances, expect our Government to give the utmost
                            attention to such matters, since respect for the flag lies at the
                            foundation of that protection which American citizens, when abroad, have
                            the right to expect at the hands of their own Government. A rigorous
                            insistence upon such respect would largely tend to avert wrongs which,
                            when once committed, diplomacy can never adequately repair. In this
                            connection, I call to the special attention of the Department the fact
                            that the flag was torn to pieces and trodden under foot.</p>
                        <p>I think the position of the Department of State is correct with reference
                            to the weakness of the Russian evidence. I see no other course to
                            pursue. In doing so, however, I think this Government should insist upon
                            the credibility of the evidence offered in behalf of the claimants. The
                            evidence is conclusive that the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi>, when seized, was not in waters subject to Russian
                            jurisdiction.</p>

                        <p>I trust the log book and affidavits inclosed will place you in possession
                            of new facts which will put the case on a different footing. So far as
                            is now possible, I have followed the suggestions of the Department in
                            the matter of procuring additional evidence.</p>
                        <p>I respectfully urge upon you the importance of having the present
                            minister conclude this business, as he is familiar with the case.</p>

                            at the time of said seizure were taken from the bodies of the cows
                            caught in the water, and neither they nor any skins were taken upon

                        <p>He further deposes that he has been in the seal-hunting business as a
                            hunter for a period of ten years, and that, in his experience, it is an
                            everyday occurrence to take such pups from the bodies of cows killed at
                            sea.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: Referring to the note of the
                            Imperial ministry of May 18 (30), 1896, I have the honor to present to
                            your excellency certain views of my Government regarding the seizure by
                            the Russian cruiser <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> of the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> in the North Pacific
                            Ocean.</p>
                        <p>I am instructed to say that my Government does not regard the
                            justification offered for the seizure of the <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis</hi>, namely, that she had been taking seals on
                            Russian territory or in Russian waters, as established in point of fact,
                            but, on the contrary, maintains that all the facts offered in evidence
                            of this theory against the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>
                            by the Imperial Government are consistent with the lawful pursuit of her
                            calling upon the high seas.</p>
                        <p>The Imperial Government has alleged that the seizure and confiscation of
                            this vessel was made because she had violated, within Russian
                            jurisdiction, the laws of the Empire for the protection of fur seals in
                            Russian territory and waters. My Government considers that to justify
                            the act the Imperial Government should show an invasion of Russian
                            territory or territorial waters by this vessel, and the taking of seals
                            by its master and crew on Russian shores or within one marine league
                            thereof. In its reply, the Imperial Government has made no contention
                            for jurisdiction over American vessels fishing in the North Pacific
                            Ocean (or Bering Sea) beyond ordinary jurisdiction waters.</p>
                        <p>In the memorandum of the Imperial ministry of marine on the subject of
                            her capture, a copy of which was inclosed in the ministerial note
                            referred to, no evidence of an affirmative character is adduced in
                            support of the contention that the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi> or her crew ever entered Russian waters; while, on the
                            other hand, the original log book showing the vessel’s daily position
                            during the voyage, which is now in the archives of this legation,
                            together with the original affidavit of the master, shows clearly that,
                            during that voyage at least, she had not been in Russian waters.</p>
                        <p>The action of the captain in retaining, after the seizure of his vessel,
                            this log book, showing his position from day to day, has been alluded to
                            in the memorandum of the ministry of marine as damaging to his
                            statements, and its authenticity has been discredited in the same
                            document. As this book formed an important piece of evidence in his
                            case, it is not surprising that the master of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >James Hamilton Lewis</hi> desired to retain it in his own
                            possession. As regards its authenticity, not only is it supported by the
                            sworn affidavits of the master and two members of the crew, but it bears
                            upon its face every evidence of being a genuine document, as I will take
                            an early opportunity of exhibiting to your excellency. All of the
                            entries are made in due order, followed by the protest of the captain
                            upon the reverse page of the last entry, and this in turn is
                            consecutively followed by the statement subscribed to by every member of
                            the crew over his signature at Vladivostock. As the crew separated after
                            leaving Vladivostock, their signatures to the log book is strong
                            corroborative evidence of the fact that it was in its present condition
                            before they left that place. A plotting of the course of the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> as indicated by this log
                            book shows a voyage entirely consistent with the assertion that she had
                            been sealing outside Bering Sea; and all the documents, including the
                            affidavits of the captain and several of the crew, attest to this, as
                            well as to the fact that the seal skins found on board were taken
                            outside of Russian jurisdiction. On the other hand, not only is it not
                            contended in the memorandum of the ministry of marine that the vessel
                            was within a marine league of Copper Island when sighted by the <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, but no evidence has been adduced that any
                            seals had been taken within Russian jurisdiction or that the vessel had
                            ever been within its limits. An early entry in the log book of the
                            voyage states that on June 28 the American gunboat <hi rend="italic"
                                >Thetis</hi> was spoken, and warned the captain of the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> against going into the
                            Bering Sea seal hunting, and the master adds, “which I abide by,”
                            thereby indicating a law-abiding disposition not likely to run counter
                            to the laws of a foreign nation which would necessarily involve more
                            serious consequences for him than the infraction of those of his own
                            country could involve.</p>
                        <p>The evidence of the statement in the memorandum of the ministry of marine
                            is that the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was seen moving
                            toward Copper Island, but more than a marine league away; that on
                            sighting the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> she turned and fled, and threw
                            something overboard; that when pursued and overhauled the master said he
                            was engaged in fishing and hunting birds; that the log book did not show
                            where the vessel had been; that a large number of seal skins were found
                            on board, with a complete <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0213"
                            />sealing outfit, and that two of the seal skins had been taken from
                            pups which were too young to swim.</p>
                        <p>It is the opinion of my Government that this is a chain of circumstances
                            which might have served the purpose of connecting the <hi rend="italic"
                                >James Hamilton Lewis</hi> with any depredations in Russian waters
                            otherwise established by direct evidence, when it was only a question of
                            who was the culprit. But the Imperial Government has not shown any
                            corpus delicti, that any seals were taken in Russian waters or
                            jurisdiction by this or any other vessel. The evidence simply shows that
                            she had come into the neighborhood of Copper Island, where, by Russian
                            acknowledgment, she had a perfect right to come, and that she had taken
                            somewhere a large number of seals, which, so far as the Imperial
                            Government is concerned, she had a perfect right to take, provided they
                            were not taken within Russian jurisdiction, and that the master evinced
                            a disposition to escape and evade inquiries made of him. The evasion of
                            search and inquiry is, in the opinion of my Government, circumstantial
                            evidence only when an obligation to submit to investigation and to
                            answer questions truly is first established. If the master of the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was overhauled and subjected
                            to interrogation which the interrogator had no lawful authority to make,
                            his reticence and indisposition to make a full disclosure can not be
                            given the construction put upon them by the Imperial Government, and my
                            Government is unable to recognize that, from the evidence adduced, such
                            authority existed on the part of the captain of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aleut</hi>. But I beg to point out to your excellency that the
                            master of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> denies these
                            allegations as to the evasion of inquiries, as is shown by his affidavit
                            which I have referred to above; but, admitting them to be true, they do
                            not, in the opinion of my Government, even tend to connect the master
                            with any unlawful act in Russian jurisdiction. He explains in a
                            reasonable and credible manner his movements and occupation up to the
                            time and place of his capture, and also the presence of the two skins of
                            young seals which at that age could not have been swimming in the ocean.
                            They were taken from the dead bodies of their mothers, as is duly sworn
                            to by two of the hunters of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis.</hi>. It is a well-known fact that many of the female seals
                            killed on the high seas are pregnant with young, ready to be born on
                            reaching the rookeries.</p>
                        <p>While my Government does not wish it to be understood as defending the
                            practice of killing mother seals pregnant with young on the high seas
                            from an economic point of view, still it maintains that such an act is
                            not in violation of any law which the Imperial Government is justified
                            in enforcing against the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                            Lewis.</hi></p>
                        <p>My Government feels itself bound to dissent from the inference which the
                            Imperial Government has drawn from the circumstances set forth, and
                            maintains that Russia has taken an American vessel on the high seas at
                            least twelve miles distant from Russian territory, and confiscated that
                            vessel, her equipment, and cargo. That she also arrested and imprisoned
                            the master and crew of this vessel, and after they were released they
                            were left to make their way home, penniless, as best they might. My
                            Government contends that such an act can only be justified on proof of
                            infraction of Russian law, and it confidently believes that when the
                            Imperial Government reconsiders the case upon the facts as they now
                            stand, it will readily acknowledge that the <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis</hi> was unlawfully taken and confiscated. In this
                            belief it would seem that nothing remains but to ascertain what
                            reimbursement is due to the owners, the master, and the crew of the
                            confiscated vessel.</p>

                            of my most distinguished consideration.</p>

                        <p>On the morning of August 2, 1891, the American schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was compelled by force of arms to come
                            to, was boarded and searched, and afterwards forcibly and violently
                            seized by the officers of the Russian war cruiser <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aleut</hi> at a point admitted by the commander of the Russian war
                            vessel to have been at least 12 miles from the Russian coast (viz,
                            Copper Island), and claimed by the captain of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Lewis</hi> to have been 20 miles from that land.</p>
                        <p>The preliminary search did not reveal any skins of seals, but the
                            commander of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> appears to have considered
                            that the outfit of the vessel was such as to indicate that she might be
                            engaged in poaching seals in Russian waters, and, as he expressed it,
                            “probably upon our shores also, if occasion offered.” In his report the
                            commander says: “In consequence,” that is to say, in consequence of the
                            suspicions aroused by the equipment of the vessel, “the commandant of
                            the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> ordered Lieutenant Lébédeff to take
                            with him six men, go aboard the schooner, and make the arrest.”</p>
                        <p>After the arrest, and in taking the <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> with a
                            prize crew to Bering Island, a more thorough search revealed 424 salted
                            seal skins, one line for fishing sea otters, and 2 skins of seals too
                            young to swim, and therefore presumed by the Russian officers,
                            apparently, to have been taken on shore.</p>
                        <p>At Bering Island her catch of seal skins, her outfit, and her stores of
                            provisions were taken from her and she was sent in charge of a prize
                            crew to Petropavlovsk, and from there to Vladivostock.</p>
                        <p>The master and crew were held prisoners from the time of the capture
                            until October 10, 1891. The master was compelled to sign a paper in
                            Russian which he believes, but, as he does not understand the language,
                            he does not know, was a notice of seizure of the schooner, and against
                            this he filed a written protest. Afterwards at Vladivostock he was
                            obliged to sign another paper which he was informed was an
                            acknowledgment that he and his crew were prisoners. The crew were
                            subjected to arduous labor, on very insufficient rations and without any
                            adequate accommodations, from the time of the seizure until their
                            arrival at Vladivostock. While at Petropavlovsk the rations allowed them
                            were barely sufficient to sustain life, and at Vladivostock they were
                            still very inadequate. At this place they were obliged to sleep on the
                            floor of some sort of a building quite unsuited to healthful conditions.
                            Here two of the crew contracted smallpox and one of them afterwards
                            died.</p>
                        <p>No trial was ever given them or the vessel by the Russian authorities,
                            although the master repeatedly demanded one.</p>
                        <p>In consequence of the above-recited arrest of the vessel, master, and
                            crew, their detention and hard treatment, the owners, master, and crew
                            of the American schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>,
                            all American citizens, memorialized the Government of the United States
                            seeking damages amounting to $123,000, as set forth in the note and
                            inclosures of the United States legation at St. Petersburg to the
                            Imperial ministry of foreign affairs, dated July 11, 1894, N. S.</p>
                        <p>In the memorandum of the Imperial ministry of marine, a copy of which was
                            inclosed to the legation of the United States in the note of the
                            imperial minister of foreign affairs, dated May 18, 1896, on the subject
                            of the capture of the <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi>, no invasion of
                            Russian territory or territorial waters by this vessel, nor the taking
                            of seals on Russian shores, or within a marine league thereof, is shown.
                            There is no contention in the reply of the Russian Government to the
                            claims of the United States that Russia has jurisdiction over American
                            vessels fishing or hunting in the North Pacific Ocean beyond ordinary
                            jurisdictional waters. Furthermore, not a particle of affirmative
                            evidence has been adduced to show that the vessel or her crew ever
                            entered Russian waters. It is not even shown that when first sighted by
                            the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> coming toward Copper Island she was
                            within a marine league of land, and upon being’ pursued by that vessel
                            she went about and sailed away from the island, so that when overhauled
                            she was from 12 to 20 miles from shore.</p>
                        <p>It is the claim of the Government of the United States that the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was not within Russian
                            jurisdictional waters when seized, and that she never had been, for any
                            purpose whatever. But had she been within such jurisdiction, so long as
                            she was not there for an unlawful act, her seizure would not have been
                            justifiable. To justify such a seizure it would be necessary to
                            establish an act of depredation on her part within such waters.</p>
                        <p>In point of fact the evidence simply shows that the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Lewis</hi> had come into the neighborhood of Copper Island, where,
                            by Russian acknowledgment, she had a perfect <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195"
                                facs="0215"/>right to come; that she had taken somewhere a large
                            number of seals, including two pups too young to swim, which, provided
                            she had not taken them within Russian jurisdiction, she had a perfect
                            right to take, so far as Russia was concerned, and that the master had
                            evinced a disposition to escape and to avoid search. In the absence of
                            any obligation to submit to search, the Government of the United States
                            can not admit that such evasion is circumstantial evidence of guilt.</p>
                        <p>It was also declared by the commander of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>
                            that during the chase the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> were
                            seen to throw something overboard. This is denied by the master and crew
                            of the schooner; but as there is no evidence whatsoever to show what
                            this something was, or, in any way to connect it with an unlawful act,
                            it must be considered as immaterial.</p>
                        <p>The log book of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, which is
                            exhibited, and a copy of which, duly authenticated by the legation, is
                            hereto appended, indicates the course of the vessel during the entire
                            voyage up to the time of the arrest, and shows that she never had been
                            nearer to Russian jurisdiction than at the time when she was sighted by
                            the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>. This log book bears upon its face
                            every evidence of genuineness. It is sworn to by the master of the
                            schooner as being a true record of the voyage, and the signatures of the
                            crew attached to the declaration as to the seizure, which follows
                            seriatim the last entry of the vessel’s position, could only have been
                            secured at Vladivostock, the crew being separated on leaving that
                            place.</p>
                        <p>Doubt has been cast upon the authenticity of this log book by the
                            officials of the Imperial ministry of marine owing to its not having
                            been produced at the time of the seizure, and in view of the fact that
                            another log book, called the official log book, was at that time
                            submitted, in which were only certain brief entries which did not at all
                            indicate the position of the vessel from day to day. There appears here
                            to be a misunderstanding on the part of the officials of the Russian
                            Government as to what the so-called official log book is.</p>
                        <p>The statutes of the United States provide and require that every vessel
                            making voyage from a port in the United States to any foreign port is
                            required to carry an “official log book,” specifically so called in the
                            statute, in which certain entries regarding the personnel of the crew
                            are required to be made. The purpose of such an official log book is to
                            offer protection to the members of the crew against possible abuse of
                            authority, and, as in case of any claim on the part of a member of the
                            crew against the master or owners of the vessel, this book might be
                            required to be retained as evidence in a court of law, it might well
                            happen, should the record of the daily position of the vessel be kept in
                            this book, that embarrassment might arise, owing to its absence from the
                            ship. Hence it is not the custom to record the ship’s course in this
                            “official log book,” but to keep it only for the record of the events
                            specified in the statute. This disposes of the point raised by the
                            Imperial Government that the ship’s daily position and due course were
                            not indicated in the official log book exhibited by the master of the
                                <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> to the commander of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleut</hi> and confiscated by him. But it is further
                            argued by the Imperial ministry of marine that the failure to produce
                            the log book which did show the vessel’s daily position is evidence that
                            such a book did not exist at the time of the arrest, but was fabricated
                            later. This conclusion is not warranted. On the contrary, as this book
                            was the direct evidence that the vessel had not been within Russian
                            waters, and therefore could not have committed any act of depredation
                            therein, and as the master proposed not alone to protest but to make a
                            claim for damages on account of the arrest from the Russian Government,
                            it was of the utmost consequence to him that this important evidence in
                            the case should not pass out of his keeping, especially in view of the
                            fact that the official log book had been immediately confiscated on its
                            exhibition.</p>
                        <p>This action of the commander of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> in
                            confiscating the official log book alarmed the master of the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, who, being inexperienced in
                            matters of official procedure, feared that the surrender of this book
                            into the hands of the arresting parties, or the putting it in jeopardy
                            of confiscation, would be an unwarrantable action on his part, in view
                            of the rights and interests of the owners and crew, and even that, if by
                            any contributory act of his it should be seized, he would lay himself
                            liable for damages for the loss of the vessel and sufferings of the
                            crew. That log book is now produced in its original condition, and
                            bearing upon its face such evidence of its authenticity and of its not
                            having been tampered with as to put it beyond any reasonable question as
                            valid testimony to the vessel’s position during the voyage. A plotting
                            of the course of the vessel according to the data furnished by this log
                            book shows a track entirely consistent with the ostensible object of the
                            voyage, namely, the pelagic hunting of seals upon the open seas, and
                            shows that she did not cross the line fixed by treaty ceding Alaska to
                            the United States until about twenty-four hours before her seizure, and
                            that she was never within a marine league of the Russian coast, her
                            nearest approach thereto being at the time she was sighted by the <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleut.</hi></p>
                        <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0216"/>
                        <p>Even were it claimed and conceded that all Bering Sea, on the Russian
                            side of the line referred to, is within the territorial jurisdiction of
                            Russia, it is not believed by the Government of the United States that
                            the Imperial Government would claim the right to seize and confiscate
                            foreign vessels or their cargoes and imprison their crews merely because
                            they happened to come within those waters. There is, however, no
                            contention, in the reply of the Imperial Government, that it had
                            jurisdiction over American vessels fishing in the North Pacific Ocean
                            (or Bering Sea) beyond ordinary jurisdictional waters.</p>
                        <p>The presence of the skins of two young seals, or pups, in the vessel was
                            assumed by the commander of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> as evidence
                            that these pups had been killed on shore, doubtless on the basis of the
                            well-known fact that up to the age of six tonight weeks, during which
                            time the pups retain the black hair with which they are born, but which
                            is shed and replaced by gray hair at about two months old, the young
                            seals can not swim. But the evidence produced before the Paris tribunal
                            clearly established, if it established nothing else, that an immense
                            number of female seals are killed at sea yearly, in the bellies of which
                            are found young. Indeed, this is shown by that evidence to be a daily
                            occurrence, and several experts declared that one-half of the seals
                            taken at sea are pregnant mothers. In the evidence before that tribunal
                            it was further shown that the skins of “black pups,” so called, are
                            regularly quoted on the London market, and these are the skins of young
                            seals taken from the wombs of their dead mothers killed at sea by the
                            pelagic seal hunters.</p>
                        <p>The two skins of young seals found on the <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis</hi> were, in fact, taken from the bellies of their
                            mothers, which were captured on the open sea, as is sworn to by the
                            master and two of the hunters, copies of whose sworn affidavits are
                            submitted herewith.</p>
                        <p>The following quotations from the proceedings of the Paris tribunal
                            furnish further strong corroborative evidence of the truth of the
                            statement of the master that the seals whose skins were found on the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> were taken on the open
                            sea.</p>
                        <p>In the paper by Dr. J. A. Allen, submitted in evidence by the Government
                            of the United States, occurs the following:</p>
                        <p>“The proof of the claim that 80 to 90 per cent (probably the latter
                            figure is nearer the truth) of the seals killed in pelagic sealing are
                            females, is varied and conclusive. It is so stated by the experts in the
                            fur trade, whose business it is to classify and grade the skins in
                            accordance with their value and quality. The usual marks which
                            characterize maternity are not only obvious in a seal’s pelt, but the
                            quality of the pelt of the breeding female is much inferior to that of
                            the ‘bachelor’ seals, which constitute the catch from the rookeries. The
                            northwest coast, or pelagic catch, has sometimes been designated in the
                            trade as the ‘female catch,’ from the great preponderance of female
                            pelts.”</p>
                        <p>Now this was the distinguishing characteristic of the skins found on the
                                <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> and seized by the <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleut</hi>. During the proceedings the deposition of
                            Mr. Thomas Morgan, agent of the lessees on the Pribilof Islands and of
                            the lessees on the Commander Islands, was submitted in evidence. In his
                            deposition Mr. Morgan stated upon oath: “I have also examined the skins
                            seized from the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> in the year
                            1891 by the Russian gunboat <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, numbering 416,
                            of which at least 90 per cent were skins of female seals, and from my
                            long observation of seals and seal skins I am able to tell the
                            difference between the skin of a male and the skin of a female
                            seal.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. John Malowansky, agent of the lessees of the Commander Islands, in
                            his sworn affidavit, also submitted in evidence before the tribunal,
                            stated: “In 1891 the schooner <hi rend="italic">J. H. Lewis</hi> was
                            caught near the islands by the Russian gunboat <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aleut</hi> and found to have 416 skins on board. I made a personal
                            examination of these skins, and found that from 90 to 95 per cent were
                            those of female seals.”</p>
                        <p>It appears, therefore, that the skins taken from the catch of seals of
                            the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> had in a marked degree
                            the indications of a pelagic catch.</p>
                        <p>Now, it was clearly proven before the Paris tribunal that the success of
                            pelagic sealing does not at all depend upon close proximity to the Seal
                            Islands. The course of the British schooner <hi rend="italic">Ada</hi>
                            on a pelagic sealing trip during the summer of 1897 shows that more
                            seals were taken at 137 miles from the islands than were captured at 40
                            miles from them. The British schooner <hi rend="italic">Alfred
                                Adams</hi> in the same season took more seals in a given time at 125
                            miles from the islands than at 60 miles from them. The mass of evidence
                            which was presented before the tribunal showing the great distances to
                            which the female seals go from the islands in search of food, and at
                            which they are killed by the pelagic hunters, is voluminous and
                            conclusive; but the two typical illustrations cited sufficiently show
                            that such hunting as that pursued by the <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis</hi> does not require incurring the risk of seizure
                            by close approach to the islands for its successful practice.</p>
                        <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0217"/>
                        <p>Briefly, the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> did not require
                            to practice her calling within Russian jurisdictional waters; nor did
                            she do so. That she approached Copper Island was because she desired to
                            verify her reckoning, taken for days previous in the dense fogs which
                            prevail during the summer months in the North Pacific Ocean. Her log
                            book and the depositions of her crew show where she was and that she was
                            cruising entirely without Russian jurisdiction. This evidence is not
                            only in itself stamped with every indication of veracity, but it is
                            entirely consistent with and sustained by all the well-known conditions
                            affecting its import. On the other hand, there is not a scintilla of
                            direct incriminating evidence against the vessel, her master, or her
                            crew.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore the confident hope and belief of the Government of the
                            United States that the Imperial Government will now, upon the new
                            evidence submitted, without further delay reimburse the owners, master,
                            and crew of the <hi rend="italic">James H. Lewis</hi> for their losses
                            sustained by the arrest and confiscation of the vessel, her outfit and
                            cargo, and the imprisonment of her master and crew.</p>
                        <p>This new evidence consists of the original of the log book of the vessel,
                            a copy of which only was previously submitted, and the supporting
                            affidavits of the master and two of the hunters.</p>
                        <p>The entries in the log book are all made consecutively in regular and
                            systematic order, without variation in spacing, up to the day of the
                            arrest. On the reverse page, following the last entry is given a copy of
                            the protest of the master, which occupied two pages, and on the reverse
                            page, following this, commences a statement of the facts of the arrest,
                            signed by every member of the crew, to the number specified by the
                            commander of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> as constituting the
                            company of the <hi rend="italic">James H. Lewis</hi>, when seized, save
                            one. This lacking name is that of the man who died at Vladivostok. These
                            signatures are all written with the same ink, and as, after leaving
                            Vladivostok, the crew separated and became scattered, their signatures
                            could only have been obtained there, while the consecutive sequence of
                            all the matter in the book, written without variation as to spacing or
                            handwriting, and followed, without hiatus, by these signatures, clearly
                            shows that these men signed a document which was complete at the
                            time.</p>

                            evidence in the case which could not be replaced by a copy, I venture to
                            ask your excellency to kindly furnish me with a receipt of the log book,
                            to be filed in the dossier of the case. I would further ask that I be
                            permitted to personally point out to the board of officers of the
                            Imperial ministry of marine, whose province it is to consider the claims
                            of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, certain salient
                            features of this log book, in a personal interview.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: Referring to my conversation
                            with you to-day in relation to the case of the <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis</hi>, I have the honor to submit the following points
                            for your excellency’s consideration:</p>
                        <p>The Imperial ministry of the marine has, as your excellency informed me,
                            stated that the log book of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi> is, in its opinion, fabricated and not to be accepted as
                            evidence of the schooner’s course, but offers no proof whatever
                            warranting such a suspicion. On the other hand, this book is confidently
                            submitted by my Government as a bona fide document, sworn to by the
                            masterof the schooner in an affidavit attached to the book itself, and,
                            moreover, the signatures of the crew to the statements of facts appended
                            to the journal could have been obtained only at Vladivostok, the crew
                            having separated and become widely dispersed thereafter. Further, as
                            this statement follows seriatim and without hiatus the entries in the
                            journal, the book could not have been fabricated after leaving
                            Vladivostok, and it is clear that the master had not the materials
                            necessary for concocting a false log book at that place. These would
                            include a sailing chart of the waters of the Bering Sea.</p>
                        <p>The ministry claims that the young seals, the skins of which were found
                            on the schooner, were taken on the Russian island, but this again is a
                            mere suspicion, with no proof whatever warranting it.</p>
                        <p>As pointed out in my memorandum, left with the ministry of foreign
                            affairs on March 17 last, nothing is better demonstrated than that young
                            seals are constantly taken in the bellies of their captured mothers in
                            pelagic sealing. Such skins constitute an article of special trade in
                            the London market. But this, as well as the sworn statement of the
                            captain and the crew that these two pups were taken from the bellies of
                            their mothers captured outside of Russian waters, and many other points
                            in my memorandum above referred to, the ministry of marine quite
                            ignores.</p>
                        <p>The ministry of marine further argues that the attempt of the captain to
                            escape is evidence of guilt. In reply I have simply to say that he went
                            about, on finding himself close to Copper Island with a Russian
                            man-of-war coming in pursuit of him, to avoid the very event which
                            afterwards happened.</p>
                        <p>But I would further point out that, in point of fact, the report of
                            Second Captain Brandt, commanding the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, does
                            not state, nor does any of the evidence of the Russian Government, as
                            far as the United States embassy or the United States Government is
                            informed, show that the <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> was, when sighted
                            or at any other time, within Russian jurisdictional waters. Captain
                            Brandt states that at 4.40 a.m. on August 2, when to the west of Copper
                            Island and about 3 miles to the north of its southern extremity, a
                            sailing schooner was sighted ahead following a northwesterly course and
                            approaching the island. Upon the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> pursuing
                            her the schooner went <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0219"/>about,
                            and at 5.15, or just thirty five minutes after her being first sighted,
                            she was overhauled at 12 miles from Copper Island. Now, it is quite out
                            of the question to suppose that the vessel was able to observe the chase
                            of the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> and go about in less than five
                            minutes, and indeed it is highly improbable that she did so in less than
                            ten minutes after her being sighted by the <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi>,
                            which had to get under way; but allowing that she was chased during
                            thirty minutes, to have been within the 3-mile limit when seen, she must
                            have sailed at the rate of 18 miles an hour, a quite impossible feat for
                            such a vessel. No racing yacht sailing under the best conditions for
                            speed has ever attained a higher speed than 1 mile in five minutes. The
                                <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> had to cover 9 miles to have been
                            within 3 miles of land when sighted and 12 miles from land when
                            overhauled. To cover this distance, sailing even at the extraordinary
                            rate of 1 mile in five minutes, would have required forty-five
                            minutes.</p>
                        <p>The situation to-day is as follows: The <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi> was captured and confiscated eight years ago, and our
                            claim remains unsettled. The United States Government has supported its
                            claim in all its details by sworn evidence, duly certified and clearly
                            proving that:</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was, when illegally
                            captured, where she had a perfect right to be, viz, on the open seas and
                            beyond the jurisdiction of the Russian Government; and this fact is
                            shown both by the affidavits of the captain and crew of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Lewis</hi> as well as according to the commander of
                            the <hi rend="italic">Aleut’s</hi> own figures as to time and
                            distance.</p>
                        <p>That the skins of the 2 seal pups were not taken on or anywhere near
                            shore, as is charged by the unsupported claim of the commander of the
                                <hi rend="italic">Aleut;</hi> and</p>
                        <p>That 424 seal skins were taken by the captain and crew of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Lewis</hi> in violation of no law.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand:</p>
                        <p>The Imperial ministry of marine submits no legal proof of evidence
                            whatever either that the <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> was within Russian
                            jurisdiction when captured, or that seal pups were captured on land, or
                            that the 424 seal skins were taken in Russian waters.</p>
                        <p>In calling the foregoing to your attention I avail myself of this
                            occasion to renew to your excellency the assurance of my most
                            distinguished consideration.</p>

                        <p>The account of the seizure of the American schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, as related in the memorandum annexed to
                            the ministerial note of May 18, 1896, states that on July 21 (August 2),
                            1891, in the morning, the sailing schooner <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis</hi>, of San Francisco, was seen from on board the
                            cruiser <hi rend="italic">Aleut</hi> of the Imperial Russian navy, then
                            lying near the southern extremity of Copper Island in Bering Sea, the
                            schooner being about 5 miles from the coast. The cruiser <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleut</hi>, after having given chase to the vessel,
                            arrested her at a distance of 11 miles from the shore as liable to
                            confiscation for being engaged in illicit seal hunting in Russian
                            waters. On the captured vessel there were found among other things a
                            chart of those waters, the official log book, and other documents.</p>
                        <p>To the claim of the captain of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi> alleging that he had not gone into Russian waters for the
                            purpose of illicit hunting of seals, and that he was arrested outside of
                            such waters, it is answered as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. The fact of the presence in Russian waters of a vessel presumably
                            engaged in illicit hunting is sufficient justification of her pursuit,
                            even after the vessel has quitted the waters in question; the place
                            where the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was seen by the
                            Russian cruiser is sufficiently conclusive under the circumstances to
                            justify the right of pursuit, for were it otherwise the protection of
                            the national interests confined to our cruisers would become entirely
                            illusory.</p>
                        <p>But a radius of 5 miles ought to be considered as coming within the limit
                            of territorial waters. According to the principles of international law
                            territorial waters are understood to be the extent of sea adjacent to
                            the shores over which the bordering power can, in fact, exercise
                            dominion, and which constitutes a prolongation of its territory.<note
                                n="a" xml:id="d8fna3">“Terrӕ dominium finitur ubi finitur armorum
                                vis.” In every case, according to existing opinions, the extent of
                                territorial waters should be considered as 5 miles from
                                shore.</note></p>
                        <p>In view of the existing means of coast defense, the perfection of
                            armaments, as well as the new conditions of social life (military,
                            financial, and economic needs), the determination of the extent of
                            territorial waters at 1 marine mile from the coast, according to the
                            theory invoked to sustain the claims in question, could not at all be
                            considered as justifiable, neither from the point of view of the
                            practical range, as it should, nor as answering all the necessities in
                            view.</p>
                        <p>Questions relative to the exploitation by foreigners of the various
                            industries of hunting and fishing in territorial waters may be regulated
                            by international arrangement, but in default of such arrangements they
                            should be regulated according to the general principles applicable to
                            the subject. In the present case, independently of the principles above
                            enunciated, the special necessity of the protection of the fur seals may
                            be cited, a necessity also recognized by the United States, inasmuch as
                            it has concluded with the Imperial Government of Russia—subsequently, it
                            is true—the arrangement of 1893, by which the extent of the prohibited
                            zone is fixed at 30 miles around the Commander Islands—that is to say,
                            up to a limit much beyond that in question in the present affair.</p>
                        <p>2. As for the presumption regarding the object of American schooner’s
                            coming into Russian waters, a presumption which was the motive of the
                            pursuit and arrest of the vessel, it was justified by the following
                            facts: Going about of the schooner on being sighted; persistent refusal
                            to permit a search; inaccurate statement with regard to the purpose of
                            her course and to the composition of the crew; haste employed to set in
                            order whatever was inside the vessel; fact of concealing 424 skins, the
                            result of the hunt; presence on board of various apparatus used in
                            hunting fur seals, as well as 2 skins of young seals which could only
                            have been killed on shore; refusal to produce authentic documents of the
                            vessel; vague declarations with regard to hunting previously on the high
                            seas, etc. The foregoing shows sufficient justification of the arrest of
                            the vessel in question.</p>
                        <p>3. As to the argument on the fact that the confiscation of the vessel and
                            her cargo was done by executive and not by judicial procedure, it is
                            answered as follows: <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0221"/>Previous
                            to the publication of the law of January 1, 1893, forbidding seal
                            hunting under pain of criminal action, administrative procedure was
                            applicable under guaranty of equity, provided by the laws in force and
                            by instructions from the supreme authority. In the present case the fact
                            must be taken into account that the sale at auction of the confiscated
                            material took place in accordance with the agreement between the
                            ministry of marine, the governor-general of the amour, and the ministry
                            of finance; the auction was fixed by the council of the admiralty. Under
                            these conditions the procedure must be considered as having been
                            entirely regular.</p>
                        <p>A new element has been introduced into the affair by the recent
                            presentation of the log book of the schooner <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis</hi>, containing data on the subject of her cruise
                            from March 7, 1891, to the day of her arrest near Copper Island.
                            Doubtless a document of this nature might have contributed to elucidate
                            the affair, and even eventually to spare much damage to the vessel in
                            question if it had been presented at the desired moment, and if it had
                            served to directly confirm the allegations of the captain.</p>
                        <p>This latter, however, instead of complying with his most elementary
                            obligations in this respect, since he states that he was engaged in
                            making certain verifications near the Russian coast, delivered to the
                            officer sent to interrogate him another register, bearing the title
                            “Official Log Book,” which contained data having no relation to the
                            affair. The log book recently presented, however great its importance
                            may have at all times been recognized to be on both sides, was only
                            transmitted in its original text to the Imperial ministry of marine, six
                            years and ten months after (May 21, 1898) the arrest of the vessel,
                            which took place July 21/August 2, 1891.</p>
                        <p>Further, the title of the log book, commencing with the words “illegally
                            seized,” indicates that it was written after the protest of the captain
                            on the subject of the act of arrest inscribed in the same book, and it
                            thus arouses suspicions as to the authenticity of the register itself.
                            The sole explanation given as to the delay in presenting this log book
                            consists in the fear of the captain to deliver an essential document
                            which could serve as his justification.</p>
                        <p>But this explanation can not be admitted, for the American captain was
                            not justified in refusing his confidence to the commander of a vessel of
                            war of the Russian navy. In view of the foregoing, independently of the
                            suspicions which the form of the log book in question itself arouses,
                            not only the latter can not be considered as serving to justify the
                            captain, but rather it is evidence of a contrary nature; that is to say,
                            it corroborates the conviction that the captain of the schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> took steps to conceal from
                            the other the true character of his operations and the exact place where
                            he had been. If the captain had had at his disposal a document of this
                            nature which might be used in his justification, it is reasonable to
                            suppose that he would have presented it at once and not deprive himself
                            of the means of thus placing himself under the protection of the laws of
                            Russia.</p>
                        <p>Finally, supposing that the log book recently presented was
                            authentic—that is to say, that it was written prior to the arrest—it
                            would not invalidate by its text alone the incontestable facts on which
                            the decision arrived at by the Russian naval authorities was based.</p>
                        <p>The ministry of marine sees therefore no reason to change its previous
                            opinion in regard to this affair, and, entertaining the above views, it
                            considers that no indemnity is due on the ground of the confiscation and
                            sale of the schooner in question.</p>

                    of the United States.</p>
                <p>The ownership of the said schooner was, on the 15th day of July, A. D. 1892,
                    vested in the Eagle Fishing Company, a corporation duly organized and existing
                    under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California of the United States
                    of America.</p>

                    Bay, Bering Island, and then placed the said schooner under the charge of a

                    Petropaulovsky, and arrived there on the 20th day of July, A. D. 1892, and the
                    schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> was there confiscated by the

                    Government and appropriated to the use of the Imperial Government of Russia.</p>
                <p>The master of the schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> duly protested to
                    the commanding officer of the said Russian war cruiser against the seizure of
                    his vessel, and against all the other acts complained of; and on the 5th day of
                    August, A. D. 1892, the said master duly lodged a protest with the governor of
                    Petropaulovsk against the seizure of his vessel and against all the other said
                    acts; and on the 31st day of August, A. D. 1892, the said master made a due and
                    formal marine protest against said seizure to James G. Swan, a notary public in
                    and for Port Townsend, State of Washington, United States of America,
                    immediately upon his arrival at said city, said city being the first place in
                    the United States at which he arrived after leaving Russian jurisdiction upon
                    his release by the Imperial Russian Government.</p>
                <p>At the time of the arrest of the said master of the schooner <hi rend="italic">C.
                        H. White</hi> he, the said master, was compelled, under duress and by
                    threats of deportation to Siberia, to sign a paper which, being in the Russian
                    language, an unknown tongue to the said master, he could not understand.</p>
                <p>The said master was, upon his arrest, put in close confinement in a room in said
                    cruiser, and there kept constantly confined under a guard of four marines until
                    the arrival of the cruiser at Petropaulovsk, without bedclothes or any change of
                    clothing nor any of his effects; and, owing to the conditions of his
                    confinement, he fell sick and was refused medical attention, and owing thereto
                    and to subsequent enforced exposure and hard treatment his health became
                    permanently impaired.</p>
                <p>Upon the final restitution of his effects to the said master he found that
                    certain of his property had been abstracted therefrom, to wit: One chronometer,
                    valued at $125; 1 aneroid barometer, valued at $7;.1 pair of marine glasses,
                    valued at $25; 1 thermometer, valued at $1; 1 lot of charts, valued at $25; 1
                    lot of nautical books, valued at $15; 1 silver watch and gold chain, valued at
                    $40; 7 razors, valued at $15; 1 coal-oil stove, valued at $3; 1 pair of rubber
                    boots, valued at $5; 1 lot of clothing, valued at $25; 2 shotguns, valued at
                    $96; 2 rifles, valued at $23.</p>
                <p>Similarly, there were abstracted from the personal effects of the mate of the
                    said vessel the following articles, to wit: Two nautical books, valued at $10; 1
                    pair of rubber boots, valued at $5; 1 oiled coat, valued at $5; 3 suits of
                    clothes, valued at $9; 7 pairs of socks, valued at $3.50; 1 watch and chain,
                    valued at $23; 1 razor, valued at $3; and 2 pocket-knives valued at $2.</p>
                <p>Similarly, there were abstracted from the personal effects of the hunter, Neils
                    Wolfgang, the following articles, to wit: One lot of underwear, valued at $7; 1
                    lot of shoes, valued at $4.50; 1 pair of trowsers, valued at $7; 1 oilskin coat,
                    valued at $3.50; 1 lot of socks, valued at $2; 1 pair of rubber boots, valued at
                    $5; one gold ring, valued at $9; 1 knife, valued at 75 cents; 9 seal skins,
                    valued at $18.</p>
                <p>The officers and men, upon arriving at Petropaulovsk, were each allowed the sum
                    of 15 kopecks a day for their subsistence, a sum equal, at the present rate of
                    exchange, to about 40 centimes in French money, and at that time worth far less,
                    and having in that country so small a purchasing power that it would only buy
                    half a loaf of bread, so that all were obliged to beg in order to obtain
                    sufficient nourishment to sustain life.</p>
                <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0234"/>
                <p>The master was obliged to seek such shelter as he could find at Petropaulovsk,
                    and although weak and suffering from exposure and privation, he was obliged to
                    content himself with such protection as was afforded by the hatch house of an
                    American vessel then lying in port—an apartment 6 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 6
                    feet high, designed for keeping tools.</p>
                <p>The mate and the rest of the crew, consisting of 10 white men and 4 Indians, were
                    assigned for shelter by the officials of the Russian Government to a leaky shed
                    18 feet long by 10 feet wide, which they were obliged to share with 24 other
                    persons. Thus 38 men were obliged to dispose themselves as best they might in a
                    building the dimensions of which were insufficient to permit all of them to lie
                    down at the same time upon the floor.</p>

                    States of America and the Imperial Government of Russia it was agreed— <quote

                <p>The same declaration was made in the treaty of 1825 between Russia and Great
                    Britain, and both of these treaties were concluded as the result of the protests
                    of the Governments of the United States and Great Britain against the claims of
                    the Imperial Government of Russia of exclusive jurisdiction within the Bering

                <p>In the tribunal of arbitration convened at Paris under the treaty between the
                    United States of America and Great Britain, concluded at Washington February 20,
                    1892, for the determination of questions between the two Governments concerning
                    the jurisdictional rights of the United States in the waters of Bering Sea, a
                    majority of the board of arbitration adopted the following decisions: <quote

                        <p>By the ukase of 1821 Russia claimed jurisdiction in the sea now known as
                            the Bering Sea to the extent of 100 Italian miles from the coasts and
                            islands belonging to her, but in the course of the negotiations which
                            led to the conclusion of the treaties of 1824 with the United States,
                            and of 1825 with Great Britain, Russia admitted that her jurisdiction in
                            said sea should be restricted to the reach of cannon shot from shore,
                            and it appears that from that time up to the cession of Alaska to the
                            United States Russia never asserted in fact or exercised any exclusive
                            jurisdiction in Bering Sea or any exclusive rights in the seal fisheries
                            therein beyond the ordinary limit of territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>The body of water now known as the Bering Sea was included in the phrase
                            “Pacific Ocean” as used in the treaty of 1825 between Great Britain and
                            Russia.</p>
                        <p>No exclusive rights of jurisdiction in Bering Sea and no exclusive rights
                            to seal fisheries therein were held or exercised by Russia outside of
                            ordinary territorial waters after the treaty of 1825.</p>
                        <p>The United States has not any right of protection or property in the fur
                            seals frequenting the islands of the United States in the Bering Sea
                            when such seals are found outside the ordinary 3-mile limit.</p>

                <p>It has therefore been decided by this international tribunal of arbitration, as
                    is shown in these decisions and in its final award, that the Bering Sea is an
                    open sea, the common highway of all nations, and that no nation can of right
                    exercise in it jurisdiction over vessels frequenting it for purposes lawful
                    under international law beyond such ordinary territorial waters therein as are
                    contiguous to its coasts, and that all nations have the right to navigate the
                    Bering Sea and to fish and take seals therein outside of such territorial
                    waters.</p>
                <p>It is admitted by the Russian Government that the <hi rend="italic">C. H.

                    She was therefore upon the high seas and wholly without Russian
                    jurisdiction.</p>

                        <p>To-day the whole extent of the sea within cannon shot of shore is
                            regarded as formng part of the territory, and hence a vessel captured
                            under the guns of a neutral fortress is not good prize. All that we have
                            said of parts of the sea near to the coast is to be said in particular
                            and with greater reason of roadsteads, bays, and straits as still more
                            susceptible of occupation and more important to the country. But I speak
                            of bays and straits of small extent, and not of great expanses of water
                            to which are sometimes given these names—as Hudson Bay, the Straits of
                            Magellan—over which empire could not extend and still less ownership.

                <p>The very eminent Russian jurist, M. F. de Martens, counsel for the Imperial

                        <p>In our day legislation and jurists are in accord in recognizing the
                            liberty of the ocean, and no people can set up the claim of governing
                            it. To-day those portions of the sea which communicate with the ocean
                            are recognized as free and accessible to all the world even when they
                            are surrounded by the possessions of a single State. (Treatise on

                        <p>The ocean is free for all peoples. No nation can be interdicted from

                            all possess there an equal right it follows that no State can there
                            impose its laws on the others, cause judgment to be passed on foreign
                            navigators or sailors, nor arrest nor search the vessels of another

                        <p>It remains to show that the sea can not be the property of any nation;
                            and as what has been said regarding full and complete ownership is
                            equally applicable to its functions—as, for example, the right of use,
                            of gathering its fruits, of taking its products—it is demonstrated that
                            no nation can possess these rights of property exclusively; that the use
                            of the sea remains eternally open and common to all; that it is, so to
                            speak, the patrimony of all mankind, a patrimony indivisible and which
                            must forever remain indivisible. (Diplomacy of the Sea, vol. 1, p.

                <p>The same author remarks: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>As to particular and interior seas a right of exclusive domain and

                            incontestable when that sea is totally surrounded by its territory so
                            that it forms an integral part of it and could absolutely serve only as
                            a means of communication and of commerce between the citizens of that
                            nation. Then, indeed, none of the conditions which interfere either with
                            ownership or empire of the seas are applicable. But the moment that
                            several different States possess the shores of such sea, none of them
                            can call itself either owner or sovereign to the exclusion of the
                            others. (Ibid., p. 159.)</p>

                <p>In the arbitration under the convention of February 8, 1863, between the United
                    States and Great Britain, of the claims growing out of the seizure of the

                    by one of Her Britannic Majesty’s cruisers, the umpire declared: <quote

                        <p>The Bay of Fundy is from 65 to 75 miles wide and from 130 to 140 miles
                            long. It has several bays on its coast. Thus the word bay, as applied to
                            this great body of water, has the same meaning as applied to the Bay of
                            Biscay and the Bay of Bengal, over which no nation can have the right to

                <p>But apart from all abstract reasoning or interpretation of the phraseology of any
                    treaty, or the application of the principles of International Law to the special
                    case, the Russian Government has itself admitted that its jurisdiction in the
                    Bering Sea is confined to the limits of ordinary territorial waters, and has
                    itself defined such limits as extending to 3 miles from its coasts. This
                    admission on the part of the Imperial Government is contained in the documents
                    hereto annexed and marked “Exhibits Q, R, and S,” already recited.</p>
                <p>It is claimed by the master and owners of the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>
                    that the vessel was seized by the Russian cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>
                    at a point 80 miles from the nearest Russian land, while the statement of the
                    Russian authorities is that the seizure was made at 23 miles from Russian land,
                        <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0238"/>as is shown by the statements
                    contained in the note of the Imperial Russian ministry of foreign affairs, dated
                    October 12 (24), 1895, submitted in the evidence herewith and marked “Exhibit
                    N.”</p>
                <p>This is a question of fact in which the testimony of the officers of the
                    respective vessels appears to differ. The claimants are unfortunately unable to
                    produce the documentary evidence as to this fact, owing to the seizure of all
                    the ship’s papers of the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, including the log
                    book, by the Russian officers. But in any case, the distance of 23 miles,
                    claimed by Russia as the point at which the seizure was made, is far without any
                    possible marine jurisdiction of any State. Nor is the claim set up, that the <hi
                        rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> had at one time been within 11 miles of
                    Medney Island, justification of the seizure of the vessel. This statement is
                    wholly at variance with the sworn testimony of the master of the vessel, but
                    whether or not the schooner was at 11 miles from Medney Island she was at all
                    events quite without Russian jurisdiction. It is not at all admitted that the
                        <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> ever was as near to Russian territory,
                    before her seizure, as 11 miles, but it is claimed with confidence that her
                    master would have been quite within his rights in taking her within that
                    distance of Russian lands up to the accepted limit of marine jurisdiction,
                    namely, a marine league from the Russian coast, and of there engaging in his
                    lawful occupation of fishing and seal hunting.</p>
                <p>And it is further claimed that none of the allegations set forth in the note of
                    the Imperial Russian ministry of foreign affairs of October 12 (24), 1895, just
                    cited, even if true, offers sufficient ground for the seizure and confiscation
                    of a vessel of a friendly State, upon the high seas, and the imprisonment and
                    maltreatment of her crew.</p>
                <p>Upon Russia’s own showing the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> was upon the
                    high seas when seized, nor is any evidence adduced to show that she ever had
                    been within Russian jurisdiction for any purpose whatsoever. The only
                    justification of the seizure offered is the statement that the vessel’s log book
                    had not been kept for two days; that certain entries in it are alleged to
                    indicate that she had been cruising “in the neighborhood of the Commander
                    Islands,” and that she bad on board apparatus for taking seals, together with 5
                    freshly killed seals which had not yet been skinned.</p>
                <p>As to the allegation that the log book had not been kept up for two days, if it
                    be true, that is a matter quite outside of Russian jurisdiction. The <hi
                        rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> was, when seized, upon the high seas wholly
                    without Russian jurisdiction, and, sailing under the flag of the United States,
                    her master was responsible only to the authorities of his own country for all
                    acts or omissions of this nature.</p>
                <p>Even if, contrary to the assertions of the master of the vessel, she had been
                    cruising in the neighborhood of the Commander Islands, an allegation the truth
                    of which, however, is not admitted, such an act does not constitute a
                    depredation upon Russian territory or a trespass upon Russian territorial
                    waters. Even within the 3-mile limit she had the right of innocent passage. In
                    regard to this Hall writes: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>In all cases in which territorial waters are so placed that a passage
                            over them is either necessary or convenient for the navigation of the
                            open seas, as in that of marginal waters or of an appropriated strait
                            connecting unappropriated waters, they are subject to the right of
                            innocent use by all mankind for the purposes of commercial navigation.
                            The general consent of nations, which was seen to be wanting, to the
                            alleged right of navigation of rivers may fairly be said to have been
                            given to that of the open sea. Even the earlier and more uncompromising
                            advocates of the right of appropriation reserved a general right of
                            innocent navigation. For more than two <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219"

                            which could be used as a thoroughfare, or into which vessels could

                <p>The Russian Government has attempted in the note of October 12 (24), 1895
                    (Exhibit N), to justify the seizure of the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> on
                    the ground of her having “probably” taken seals within Russian territorial
                    waters. There is no evidence whatever offered by the Russian Government to
                    support this allegation, and on the contrary the master of the schooner
                    positively denies, under oath, that any seals were taken within Russian
                    territorial waters.</p>
                <p>No invasion of Russian territory or territorial waters or depredation therein or
                    any corpus delicti has been shown by Russia, nor is there a particle of
                    affirmative evidence to show that this vessel or anyone connected with her ever
                    entered Russian waters for any purpose whatsoever.</p>
                <p>The utmost that the Russian Government has been able to say in justification of
                    the seizure is that the vessel was taken on the high seas on suspicion of having
                    violated the municipal laws of Russia.</p>
                <p>No judicial proceedings, so far as the parties in interest in the vessel or the
                    Government of their country has ever been informed, were ever held to condemn or
                    acquit the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, but she was simply confiscated
                    and her master and crew made to suffer penal imprisonment on suspicion. No
                    Government or its agents has the right to seize and confiscate foreign vessels
                    and their cargoes on the high seas and imprison and maltreat their crews merely
                    because it is believed that such vessels or their crews have violated the
                    municipal laws of the country. If, in the exercise of belligerent rights, the
                    vessel of an enemy State, seized by a ship of war, is entitled to trial before a
                    duly organized prize tribunal before confiscation, much more is the vessel of a
                    friendly State, in time of peace, entitled to such proceedings, even were the
                    right of visit and search in time of peace admitted.</p>
                <p>The question of visitation and search and of seizure of neutral vessels without
                    the limits of territorial jurisdiction is thus discussed by Mr. Dana in his
                    note, No. 108, to Wheaton’s International Law: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It is true that Chief Justice Marshall admitted the right of a nation to
                            secure itself against intended violations of its laws by seizures made
                            within reasonable limits, as to which, he said, nations must exercise
                            comity and concession, and the exact extent of which was not settled;
                            and, in the case before the court, the 4 leagues were not treated as
                            rendering the seizure illegal. This remark must now be treated as an
                            unwarranted admission. It may be said that the principle is settled;
                            that municipal seizures can not be made for any purpose beyond
                            territorial waters. It is also settled that the limit of these waters
                            is, in the absence of treaty, the marine league or the cannon shot. It
                            can not now be successfully maintained either that municipal visits or
                            search may be made beyond territorial waters for special purposes or
                            that there are different bounds of that territory for different objects.
                            But as the line of territorial waters, if not fixed, is dependent on the
                            unsettled range of artillery fire, and if fixed, must be by an arbitrary
                            measure, the courts, in the earlier cases, were not strict as to
                            standards of distance where no foreign powers intervened in the causes.
                            In later times it is safe to infer that judicial as well as political
                            tribunals will insist on one line of marine territorial jurisdiction for
                            the exercise of force on foreign vessels in time of peace for all
                            purposes alike.</p>

                    ownership in the seals beyond territorial limits or the right of seizure beyond
                    such limits for purposes of preservation of the fisheries.</p>
                <p rend="center">THE MEASURE OF DAMAGE.</p>
                <p>The seizure of the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> was therefore unwarrantable
                    and unjustifiable, and the Russian Government has become responsible for all
                    injuries to the parties in interest resulting from the seizure and confiscation
                    of the vessel, as well as from all the other acts connected therewith.</p>
                <p>The loss of the vessel itself is not the only direct injury sustained by these
                    claimants in consequence of the confiscation of their vessel. The loss of the
                    use and service of their schooner and her outfit during the season for the
                    purpose for which she was equipped is also to be taken into consideration. This
                    is an injury sustained, not alone by the owners, but by the officers and crew as
                    well, who were thereby deprived of the means of earning their living. No one has
                    the right to deprive another of the means of gaining his sustenance in any
                    lawful calling which he may see fit to engage in. Equally, no one has the right,
                    by a summary act, to divert the earning capacity of the invested capital of
                    another. If the laborer is worthy of his hire, so also is invested capital
                    entitled to its legitimate profits.</p>
                <p>The damages sustained by these claimants can not be measured by <pb n="221"
                        xml:id="pg_221" facs="0241"/>the value of their vessel and its outfit alone.
                    They had committed no trespass upon Russia, either by an invasion of her
                    territory or waters, or by any other offense against Russian rights, and they
                    were entitled to go peaceably on their way, employing their vessel and their own
                    services in the lawful calling in which they were engaged. When the Russian
                    Government, through its officers or agents, assumed to deprive them of this
                    right it became responsible for all the consequences of its act. To restore to
                    these parties, at the present time, their vessel or its value would not
                    reimburse them for their losses, or place them in the advantageous position they
                    occupied at the time of the seizure. Neither would the addition of interest on
                    such payment compensate the parties for their loss. The owners had not embarked
                    their capital in a hazardous undertaking upon the ocean to gain simply such
                    interest as their money might earn at home by its investment in securities. In
                    every well-regulated business undertaking, in which capital is involved, the
                    interest upon the capital is deducted from the gross proceeds before profits are
                    declared. As it is now impossible to put the parties back where they were at the
                    time of the seizure, the only just basis of compensation for the injuries
                    sustained by them owing to the seizure is upon a fair estimate of the probable
                    catch, added to the value of the vessel and its outfit, together with interest
                    upon the whole. As upon a sealing voyage the crew are compensated by lay in lieu
                    of wages, such a basis discharges the indemnity due both to them and to the
                    owners.</p>
                <p>The damages here claimed for loss of catch are in no sense indirect damages for
                    loss of speculative profits. They represent an actual loss sustained by the
                    owners, officers, and crew, and are of the nature of demurrage. Had the Russian
                    Government, at the moment of the seizure, handed over to the master of the <hi
                        rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> the full value of his vessel and equipment
                    and returned him with his crew to San Francisco the voyage of the schooner would
                    have been a positive loss to all the parties concerned. The earnings of a
                    sealing vessel depend upon her taking advantage of her opportunity when it
                    arrives, and the loss of her use with that of her outfit and crew in the middle
                    of the season deprives her owners of any return upon their investment and her
                    officers and crew of all remuneration for their labor.</p>
                <p>The rule of damages is well settled that in a fishing voyage the loss of the
                    services of a fishing vessel is to be compensated upon the value of the vessel’s
                    use. The objection that prospective profits are not admissible as a substantive
                    ground of damage does not apply or exclude the use of the average catch of a
                    fishing vessel as evidence of the value of the vessel’s use, but is the best
                    evidence, exactly as it is the evidence used in other cases to determine the
                    injury suffered by a party from the deprivation of the use of his property.</p>

                <p>Thus the arbitrator in this case, clearly admitting the justice of the claim for

                    contributory acts of negligence on the part of the parties in interest in the
                    vessel so modified the degree of responsibility of the Dutch Government for the

                <p>In the case of Williamson <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Barrett, before the Supreme
                    Court of the United States, Mr. Justice Nelson, in delivering the opinion of the
                    Court, said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>As to the question of damages.</p>
                        <p>The jury were instructed, if they found for the plaintiffs, to give
                            damages that would remunerate them for the loss necessarily incurred in
                            raising the boat and repairing her, and also for the use of the boat
                            during the time necessary to make the repairs and fit her for
                            business.</p>
                        <p>By the use of the boat, we understand what she would produce to the
                            plaintiffs by the hiring or chartering of her to run upon the river in
                            the business in which she had been usually engaged.</p>
                        <p>The general rule in regulating damages in cases of collision is to allow
                            the injured party an indemnity to the extent of the loss sustained. This
                            rule is obvious enough; but there is a good deal of difficulty in
                            stating the grounds upon which to arrive, in all cases, at the proper
                            measure of that indemnity.</p>
                        <p>The expenses of raising the boat and of repairs may, of course, be
                            readily ascertained, and in respect to repairs, no deduction is to be
                            made, as in insurance cases, for the new materials in place of the old.
                            The difficulty lies in estimating the damage sustained by the loss of
                            service of the vessel while she is undergoing the repairs.</p>
                        <p>That an allowance short of some compensation for this loss would fail to
                            be an indemnity for the injury is apparent. This question was directly
                            before the court of admiralty in England in the case of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Gazelle</hi>, decided by Dr. Lushington in 1844. (2 W.
                            Robinson, 279.) That was a case of collision, and in deciding it the
                            court observed: “That the party who had suffered the injury is clearly
                            entitled to an adequate compensation for any loss he may sustain for the
                            detention of the vessel during the period which is necessary for the
                            completion of the repairs and furnishing the new articles.”</p>
                        <p>In fixing the amount of the damages to be paid for the detention, the
                            court allowed the gross freight, deducting so much as would in ordinary
                            cases be disbursed on account of the ship’s expenses in earning it.</p>
                        <p>This rule may afford a very fair indemnity in cases where the repairs are
                            completed within the period usually occupied in the voyage in which the
                            freight is to be earned, but if a longer period is required it obviously
                            falls short of an adequate allowance. It looks to the, capacity of the
                            vessel to earn freight for the benefit of the owner and consequent loss
                            while deprived of her service; in other words, to the amount she would
                            earn him on hire. (13 Howard, 101.)</p>

                <p>This subject has recently undergone the most thorough and careful examination by
                    the commission appointed to adjust the claims of the Canadian sealers against
                    the Government of the United States, commonly known as the Bering Sea claims. It
                    is scarcely necessary to do more than to refer to the arguments submitted before
                    this tribunal on behalf of the English Government and of the American Government
                    for the most complete and exhaustive review of all the decisions upon the
                    subject.</p>
                <p>The English Government contended for the rule as claimed in the present case. An
                    examination of the awards made in certain cases before the Bering Sea Commission
                    leaves no room for doubt that in those cases at least the commission adopted the
                    rule as contended for by the English Government and as herein stated. In the
                    awards upon <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0244"/>all of these claims it is
                    perfectly clear that the loss of catch was allowed in measuring the damages. If
                    there were any doubt of this it is relieved by such cases as No. 14, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Triumph</hi>, where the sole claim was for loss of catch. In
                    the case of the <hi rend="italic">Triumph</hi>, No. 14 (not No. 11 for the same
                    vessel) the award was $15,450; the original claim was for $19,674, of which $250
                    was for legal and other expenses, $19,424 being for balance of estimated catch
                    of 2,500 skins at $8. It was admitted that the <hi rend="italic">Triumph</hi>
                    had transshipped part of her season’s catch before entering Bering Sea on or
                    about July 4; a considerable part of the season had therefore already elapsed
                    and it was reasonable to suppose that she had taken a fifth part of her probable
                    catch before entering Bering Sea; thus 2,000 skins would remain to be taken to
                    make up the season’s work of 2,500 skins. She had on board 72 skins when taken,
                    leaving 1,928 to be taken to make up the 2,000. One thousand nine hundred and
                    twenty-eight skins at $8 would amount to $15,424, and the award was for $15,450,
                    as has been said.</p>
                <p>There can be no possible room for doubt that this was the rule adopted by the
                    Bering Sea Commission in fixing the damages in these cases. A careful
                    examination of the cases shows that the rule here contended for was universally
                    applied.</p>

                <p>In the claim of Lawrence M. Furman, the master of the <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                        White</hi>, for indemnity for the injuries suffered by him, the following
                    facts must be taken into consideration in addition to the mere fact of the
                    summary and unwarrantable arrest of this citizen of a friendly State by the
                    agents of the Imperial Government of Russia, for no other reason than the
                    suspicion that he and his subordinates had violated, or might in the future
                    violate, the municipal laws of Russia. First, Captain Furman was compelled,
                    under duress and threats of deportation to Siberia, and against his protest, to
                    sign a document of which he could of his own knowledge have had no understanding
                    of the contents, not speaking or understanding the Russian language, in which it
                    was written. The claim that certain written comments made by him upon the
                    document are evidence that he knew what he was signing can not be admitted. It
                    is not improbable that the purport of the document was explained to him, but
                    whether wholly or in part, or how exactly, there is no evidence to show; and in
                    any case such an ex parte translation can not be said to have acquainted him
                    with the exact meaning and bearing of the document, though it might suffice to
                    indicate that some comment on his part was necessary. The whole transaction
                    evinced a purpose to compel Furman by threats to sign a paper containing
                    admissions he could not understand, with the object of relieving the Russian
                    officers and Government of all liability. But apart from the question of whether
                    or not he knew what he was signing, the use of threats to compel him to perform
                    the act constituted a grievous wrong, which should be taken into account in
                    measuring the damages which should be awarded to this citizen of the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>His subsequent close and penal confinement and the refusal of medical aid to him
                    while suffering illness, caused by enforced exposure to which he was subjected,
                    entailing permanent injury to his health; the indignities and hardships suffered
                    by him, together with the loss of valuable personal effects, are all elements of
                    which the sum amounts <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0245"/>to a grave
                    injury, for which he is entitled to fully adequate compensation from the
                    Government whose agents or officers undertook to inflict upon him this great and
                    unwarrantable wrong to his person and to his citizenship of a friendly
                    State.</p>
                <p>The damages suffered by the mate, Andrew Ronning, and the hunter, Neils Wolfgang,
                    are only less in degree.</p>
                <p>The loss by all of these officers of the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> of
                    the most valuable of their effects is of itself evidence of a disregard on the
                    part of the Russian officials connected with this affair of the responsibilities
                    and obligations incumbent on them in their relations with these citizens of a
                    friendly State. That these officials, having taken it upon themselves to make
                    these arrests on suspicion, should not have either at once put them in
                    possession of their personal belongings or carefully sealed them up in such a
                    manner as to preclude the possibility of their loss by accident or by the
                    pilfering of dishonest persons, indicates a reckless disregard of the personal
                    rights of their prisoners which must go far to convince the judicial mind of the
                    likelihood of their committing other acts of wrong in their treatment of them.
                    Doubtless these are the isolated acts of individuals which in no sense reflect
                    upon either the humanity or the sense of right of the Russian Government; but
                    that Government, having clothed these their agents with the powers they
                    exercised, became responsible for their wrongful acts.</p>
                <p>One has only to consider the size of the building in which the crew was confined,
                    and the number of persons there incarcerated, for evidence of the general
                    harshness with which these people were treated. This building was 18 feet long
                    by 10 feet wide, and in it were confined 38 men, namely, 14 from the <hi
                        rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> and 24 others from other vessels. Supposing
                    that these prisoners lay in three rows upon the floor, each man would have a
                    space of 10 inches in width, in two of the rows, and of a little over 9 inches
                    in the third row.</p>
                <p>The bill of damages hereto annexed is submitted in the confident belief that it
                    will be found to present an entirely equitable claim for the indemnity due to

                    <p rend="center">(1.)</p>
                    <p>The memorial of the Eagle Fishing Company to the Department of State of the
                        United States respectfully shows:</p>
                    <p>That the Eagle Fishing Company is now, and was at the time when the claim
                        hereinafter set forth had its origin, a corporation duly organized and
                        existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California, and
                        having its principal office and place of business in the city and county of
                        San Francisco, State of California, and makes this claim and memorial in its
                        right and for its own benefit.</p>
                    <p>That the names and residences of the stockholders, officers, and directors of
                        said corporation are as follows, to wit:</p>
                    <p>Johan H. C. Prien, San Francisco, president; Charles W. Preiss, San
                        Francisco, vice-president; Charles A. Wagner, San Francisco, secretary;
                        Louis Schmidt, San Francisco, director; Lawrence M. Furman, master of
                        vessel.</p>
                    <p>That the above-named stockholders own all of the capital stock of said Eagle
                        Fishing Company, and that they and each of them are now, and were at the
                        time when the claim hereinafter set forth had its origin, citizens of the
                        United States, and duly qualified and registered voters in the city and
                        county of San Francisco, State of California.</p>
                    <p>The said Eagle Fishing Company claims from the Russian Government the sum of
                        $100,000, being the entire sum hereby claimed; the company believes that the
                        sum so claimed would not reimburse it for the losses sustained by the
                        wrongful act of the authorities of the Russian Government, hereinafter set
                        forth; and that this company has received no money or other equivalent or
                        indemnification from insurance or otherwise for the whole or any part of the
                        loss or injury upon which this claim is founded.</p>
                    <p>That the said claim is based upon the following facts and circumstances, to
                        wit:</p>
                    <p>The said Eagle Fishing Company, in pursuit of its regular and legitimate
                        business, was at all the times herein mentioned the owner of the American
                        schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, which said schooner was
                        enrolled and registered in the port of San Francisco, and said schooner was
                        regularly cleared from said port for a fishing and hunting voyage in the
                        North Pacific Ocean or elsewhere, as the master might direct, having at the
                        time on board said vessel a hunting and fishing outfit, consisting of
                        rifles, shotguns, powder, and hunting and fishing gear, all of which will
                        more fully and at large appear by the certified copies of the original
                        clearance papers and outward manifest of said schooner, which are herewith
                        filed, and that the reason why the original of all the said papers are not
                        filed is that all of said original papers were seized as hereinafter
                        mentioned.</p>
                    <p>That Lawrence M. Furman, one of the stockholders and directors of the Eagle
                        Fishing Company, was then, and at all the times hereinafter mentioned, the
                        fully acting and qualified master of the said schooner, and is now, and was
                        at the time when the claim herein set forth had its origin, a citizen of the
                        United States of America and of the State of California, and that the said
                        Eagle Fishing Company was, prior to and at all the times hereinafter
                        mentioned, and now is, the owner of a fishing station on Atu Island, the
                        most westerly of the Aleutian Islands, belonging to the United States; that
                        the said schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, on the 7th day of May,
                        A. D. 1892, under command of the said master, and with a good and sufficient
                        crew and a hunting and fishing outfit on board, as aforesaid, did set sail
                        and depart from the said port of San Francisco, bound for the North Pacific
                        Ocean, said vessel being at the time and at all the times hereinafter
                        mentioned seaworthy, and in all respects fit for the voyage which it took,
                        as herein mentioned; that the master and crew proceeded with said vessel on
                        their voyage without disaster of any kind until the 15th day of July, A. D.
                        1892, and that prior to said day and in the open Pacific Ocean, more than 30
                        miles south of the Aleutian Islands,” and not in Russian waters, had <pb
                            n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0251"/>caught 8 barrels of mackerel and 1
                        ton of codfish, and had killed 20 seals, all of which were caught and killed
                        on the voyage from San Francisco, and more than 30 miles south of the
                        Aleutian Islands, and not in Russian waters; that said master and crew, on
                        about the 12th day of July, A. D. 1892, being then fishing about 40 miles
                        south of Agattou Island, one of the Aleutian Islands, with said vessel, then
                        set sail for the Kurile Islands, off the coast of Japan, intending to fish
                        there, and the master of said schooner, finding that his chronometer was
                        out, wanted to sight land to correct the chronometer, and accordingly
                        deviated from his course or route to Kurile Islands for the purpose of
                        sighting either Copper or Bering Island to correct his chronometer, and on
                        the 15th day of July arrived at latitude 54° 18’ north, longitude 167° 19’
                        east, by correct observation, and had not fished or sealed in said place,
                        nor at any place within 50 miles thereof, or in Russian waters at all, and
                        the wind being light, but the vessel sailing on its course as aforesaid, and
                        no boats being out from said vessel, either for hunting or fishing, and no
                        one from said vessel being either hunting or fishing.</p>
                    <p>Said latitude 54° 18’ north, longitude 167° 19’east by correct observation,
                        measured on the United States Coast Survey Chart, No. 900, more than 80
                        miles from Cooper or Bering islands on the high seas, and not in Russian
                        waters, when, at said time, and in the latitude and longitude above
                        mentioned, on the 15th day of July, A. D. 1892, as aforesaid, and not being
                        at the time hunting or fishing, and not having at any time fished or hunted
                        seals in Russian waters, but being at said time on its course for the Kurile
                        Islands, as aforesaid, the said schooner was boarded by an officer from the
                        Russian war cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>, which said war cruiser
                            <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> was at all the times herein mentioned a
                        steamer regularly commissioned as a war cruiser, and belonging to the
                        Russian Government; armed for offensive and defensive warfare, and acting
                        under the authority and by the direction of the said Russian Government, and
                        the master was by said officer ordered to come on board of said cruiser,
                        with all the schooner’s papers; the master accordingly went on board, and
                        the captain of said cruiser, after examining the schooner’s papers, arrested
                        the master, and then had all the crew of said cruiser [<hi rend="italic"
                            >sic</hi>] except the mate, brought on board of said cruiser, and master
                        and crew of said schooner were kept on said cruiser as prisoners. The said
                        Russian cruiser then and there seized said schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H:
                            White</hi> and towed it to Nicholovsky Bay, Bering Island, and then
                        placed said schooner under a prize crew and sent it to Petropaulovsky, and
                        the cruiser, with the master and crew of said schooner as prisoners, sailed
                        to Petropaulovsky, and arrived there on the 20th day of July, A. D.
                        1892.</p>
                    <p>The Russian Government seized said schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                            White</hi> as hereinbefore set forth, but this company does not know
                        what disposition was made of said schooner, but is advised and believes, and
                        therefore alleges, that said schooner was repainted and refitted and used by
                        said Russian Government, and is now in its possession, and by it used.</p>
                    <p>That the master of said schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> duly
                        protested at the time to the captain of said war cruiser against the seizure
                        of said vessel and against all the other acts herein complained of; that on
                        the 5th day of August, A. D. 1892, the said master duly noted a protest
                        against said seizure and said acts with the governor of Petropaulovsky; and
                        that said master on the 31st day of August, A. D. 1892, duly made a marine
                        protest against said seizure to James G. Swan, a notary public in and for
                        Port Townsend, State of Washington, United States of America, immediately
                        upon his arrival at said city, and said city being the first place in the
                        United States at which he arrived.</p>
                    <p>That the seizure of said schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> and all
                        of said acts by said Russian war cruiser by the officers thereof and by the
                        Russian officials were in violation of the law of nations and of the right
                        of citizens of the United States, and in contravention to the treaties
                        existing between the United States of America and Russia, and that this
                        claim is founded upon the principles of international law and the rights
                        which every nation and every person has upon the high seas, and upon the
                        fact that all the above-mentioned acts by the Russian Government and its
                        officials were in violation thereof.</p>
                    <p>Wherefore this company hereby requests the interposition of the Government of
                        the United States of America against the Russian Government for the
                        presentation of this claim against the Russian Government.</p>

                    <p>My full name is Lawrence Magnus Furman; I am 37 years of age; I was born in
                        the city of Guttenburg, Sweden; I am now a resident, and at all the times
                        when the events took place in regard to which I make this affidavit I was a
                        resident of the city and county of San Francisco, State of California; I am
                        now and at all the times when the events took place in regard to which I
                        make this affidavit, I was by occupation a master mariner; I have an
                        interest in the claim of the Eagle Fishing Company against the Russian
                        Government, to support which claim I make this affidavit, that interest is
                        as follows: I own one share of the capital stock of the Eagle Fishing
                        Company, and am director thereof; I have no contingent interest in said
                        claim other than should said Eagle Fishing Company recover damages I will
                        receive a dividend of the amount recovered as owner of said share of stock.
                        There are 1,500 shares of the stock of said corporation now in force. I am
                        not the agent or attorney for the said claimant or for any person having an
                        interest in said claim. I am a duly naturalized citizen of the United States
                        of America, but I can not now produce a certified copy of the record of my
                        said naturalization, but will hereafter produce the same if necessary.</p>
                    <p>I was on the 7th day of May, A. D. 1892, the duly acting and qualified master
                        of the American schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, belonging to
                        said Eagle Fishing Company, which said vessel on said day duly cleared from
                        said port of San Francisco for a hunting and fishing voyage in the North
                        Pacific Ocean, having at the time all necessary and requisite legal papers
                        on board, as will more fully and at large appear by the memorial and papers
                        on file herein; on said day I was master, as aforesaid, did in and with said
                        schooner set sail and depart from the said port of San Francisco, bound for
                        the North Pacific Ocean, said vessel being at that time and at all the times
                        hereinafter mentioned seaworthy and in all respects fit for the voyage which
                        it took, as herein mentioned; I proceeded with said vessel and crew on my
                        voyage without disaster of any kind, until the 15th day of July, A. D. 1892,
                        and prior to said day and in the open Pacific Ocean, more than 30 miles
                        south of the Aleutian Islands and not in Russian waters, had caught 8
                        barrels of mackerel and 1 ton of codfish and had killed 20 seals, all of
                        which were caught and killed on the voyage from San Francisco and more than
                        30 miles south of the Aleutian Islands and not in Russian waters; I with
                        said vessel and crew on or about the 12th day of July, A. D. 1892, being
                        then fishing about 40 miles south of Agattou Island, one of the Aleutian
                        Islands, set sail for the Kurile Islands off the coast of Japan, intending
                        to fish there, and knowing that my chronometer was out, wanted to sight land
                        to correct my chronometer, and accordingly deviated toward the Copper and
                        Bering islands for the purpose of sighting them or one of them and
                        correcting my chronometer, as aforesaid, and on the 15th day of July arrived
                        at latitude 54° 16’ north, longitude 167° 18’ east, by correct observation,
                        and had not fished or sealed in said place nor at any place within 50 miles
                        thereof, or in Russian waters at all, and the wind being light, but the
                        vessel sailing on its course as aforesaid, and no boats being out from said
                        vessel, either for hunting or fishing, and no one from said vessel being
                        either hunting or fishing.</p>
                    <p>Said latitude 54° 18’ north, longitude 167° 19’ east, is, by correct
                        observation, measured by me on the United States Coast Survey Chart, No.
                        900, more than 80 <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0253"/>miles from Copper
                        or Bering islands on the high seas, and not in Russian waters; when at said
                        time, and in the latitude and longitude above mentioned, on the 15th day of
                        July, A. D. 1892, as aforesaid, and not being at the time hunting or,
                        fishing, and not having at any time fished or hunted seals in Russian
                        waters, but being at said time on my course for the Kurile Islands, as
                        aforesaid, the said schooner was boarded by an officer from the Russian war
                        cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>, which said war cruiser <hi
                            rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> was at all times herein mentioned a regularly
                        commissioned war cruiser, belonging to the Russian Government, armed for
                        offensive and defensive warefare, and acting under the authority and by the
                        directions of the said Russian Government, and I was by said Russian officer
                        ordered to come on board of said cruiser with all the schooner’s papers; I
                        accordingly went on board, and the captain of said cruiser, after examining
                        the schooner’s papers, arrested me, and then all of the crew of the said
                        schooner, except the mate, were brought on board of said schooner as
                        prisoners. The said Russian cruiser then and there seized said schooner, <hi
                            rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, and towed it to Mcholovsky Bay, Bering
                        Island, and then placed said schooner under a prize crew and sent it to
                        Petropaulovsky, and the cruiser with me and the crew of said schooner as
                        prisoners, sailed to Petropaulovsky and arrived there on the 20th day of
                        July, A. D. 1892; and while on board of said cruiser, I was by the captain
                        of said cruiser forced to sign a paper in Russian, which I did not
                        understand, the said captain threatening to send me to Siberia unless I
                        signed said paper, and I only signed said paper under a protest in
                        consequence of said threat and the duress exercised by said captain of said
                        cruiser.</p>
                    <p>The Russian Government seized said schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                            White</hi>, as herein set forth, but I do not know what disposition was
                        made of said schooner, but I am advised and believe, and therefore allege,
                        that said schooner was repainted and refitted and used by said Russian
                        Government, and is now in its possession and by it used.</p>
                    <p>I, as master of said schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, duly
                        protested at the time to the captain of the said war cruiser against the
                        seizure of said vessel and against all his other acts herein testified in
                        regard to; and on the 5th day of August, 1898, I, as master, duly noted a
                        protest against said seizure and said acts with the governor of
                        Petropaulovsky; and I, as said master, on the 31st day of August, 1892, duly
                        made a regular marine protest against said seizure to James G. Swan, a
                        notary public in and for Port Townsend, State of Washington, United States
                        of America, immediately upon my arrival at said city, and said city being
                        the first place in the United States at which I arrived.</p>

                    <head>EXHIBIT H.</head>
                    <p>The memorial of Lawrence Magnus Furman to the Department of State,
                        respectfully shows:</p>
                    <p>That said Lawrence M. Furman is now, and was at the time when the claim
                        hereinafter set forth had its origin, a regularly naturalized citizen of the
                        United States, and that he is unable to produce herewith a duly certified
                        copy of the record of his naturalization, but will hereafter produce the
                        same if required; that he is now, and was at the time when the claim
                        hereinafter set forth had its origin, a resident of the city and county of
                        San Francisco, State of California, and a duly qualified and registered
                        voter therein.</p>
                    <p>That said Lawrence M. Furman claims from the Russian Government the sum of
                        $25,000, being the entire sum hereby claimed; this claimant believes that
                        the sum so claimed would not reimburse him for the loss and damage sustained
                        by him from the wrongful acts of the authorities of the Russian Government
                        hereinafter set forth, and that this claimant has received no money or other
                        equivalent or indemnification from insurance or otherwise for the whole or
                        any part of the loss or injury upon which this claim is founded.</p>
                    <p>That the said claim is based upon the following facts and circumstances, to
                        wit:</p>
                    <p>That I, the said Lawrence M. Furman, on the 7th day of May, A. D. 1892, was
                        the duly acting and qualified master of the American schooner <hi
                            rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, belonging to the Eagle Fishing Company,
                        of San Francisco, Cal., which said vessel on said <pb n="234"
                            xml:id="pg_234" facs="0254"/>day cleared from the said port of San
                        Francisco for a hunting and fishing voyage in the North Pacific Ocean,
                        having at the time all the necessary and legal papers on board, as will more
                        fully and at large appear by the memorial, and papers in support thereof, of
                        said Eagle Fishing Company on file in this Department, and that on the said
                        day I with said vessel and a good and sufficient crew did set sail and
                        depart from said port of San Francisco, bound for the North Pacific Ocean,
                        said vessel being at that time and at all times hereinafter mentioned
                        seaworthy and in all respects fit for the voyage which it took, as herein
                        mentioned. I proceeded with said vessel and crew on my voyage without
                        disaster of any kind until the 15th day of July, A. D. 1892, and that prior
                        to said day, and in the open Pacific Ocean, more than 30 miles south of the
                        Aleutian Islands, and not in Russian waters, had caught 8 barrels of
                        mackerel and 1 ton of codfish, and had killed 20 seals, all of which were
                        caught and killed on the voyage from San Francisco, and more than 30 miles
                        south of the Aleutian Islands, and not in Russian waters; that about the
                        12th day of July, A. D. 1892, I, being then fishing about 40 miles south of
                        Agattou Island, one of the Aleutian Islands, off the coast of Japan,
                        intending to fish there, and then finding that my chronometer was out,
                        wanted to sight land to correct the chronometer, and, accordingly, deviated
                        from my course or route to the Kurile Islands for the purpose of sighting
                        either Copper or Bering Island, to correct my chronometer, and on the 15th
                        day of July arrived at latitude 54° 18’ north, longitude 167° 19’ east, by
                        correct observation, and had not fished or sealed in said place nor at any
                        place within 50 miles thereof, or in Russian waters at all; and the wind
                        being light, but the vessel sailing on its course as aforesaid, and no boats
                        being out from said vessel, either for hunting or fishing, and neither I nor
                        anyone from said vessel being either hunting or fishing.</p>
                    <p>Said latitude 54° 18’ north, longitude 167° 19’ east, is by correct
                        observation measured by me on the United States Coast Survey chart No. 900
                        more than 80 miles from Copper or Bering Islands, on the high seas, and not
                        in Russian waters; when at the same time, and in the same latitude and
                        longitude above mentioned, on the 15th day of July, A. D. 1892, as
                        aforesaid, and not being at the time hunting or fishing, and not having at
                        any time fished or hunted seals in Russian waters, but being at said time on
                        my course for the Kurile Islands as aforesaid, the said schooner was boarded
                        by an officer from the Russian war cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>,
                        which said war cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> was at all times
                        herein mentioned a steamer regularly commissioned as a war cruiser, and
                        belonging to the Russian Government, armed for offensive and defensive
                        warfare, and acting under the authority and by the directions of the said
                        Russian Government; and I was by said officer ordered to come on board of
                        said cruiser with all the schooner’s papers; and I accordingly went on
                        board, and the captain of said cruiser, after examining the schooner’s
                        papers, had all the crew of said schooner brought on board of said cruiser,
                        and I, with all the crew of said schooner, was then and there arrested, and
                        I was compelled by the officers of said cruiser to sign a paper in Russian
                        language, which I do not understand, under threat of being sent to Siberia,
                        and was kept on said cruiser as prisoner by the officers thereof until the
                        cruiser arrived at Petropaulovsky, on the 20th day of July, A. D. 1892; I
                        was kept confined in a room of said cruiser without bedclothes or any change
                        of clothing, although I demanded my personal effects from the officers of
                        the cruiser, which demand was refused by them.</p>
                    <p>The said cruiser, with me and the rest of the crew as prisoners, and with the
                        schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> in tow, set sail for Nicholovsky
                        Bay, where we arrived on the 16th day of July, A. D. 1892. During the day
                        and night which elapsed prior to our arrival at Nicholovsky Bay I was kept
                        in the above-mentioned room without any bedclothes or any clothing whatever
                        except those I had on, and was compelled to keep the doors and windows open;
                        the weather during that night was cold and foggy, and I then and there, from
                        the cruel and unnecessary exposure, caught cold, from which, owing to the
                        exposure above and the exposure and ill treatment and lack of food and
                        medicines hereinafter complained of, I have never recovered.</p>
                    <p>Upon our arrival at Nicholovsky Bay I was permitted to go on board the <hi
                            rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, under the charge of an armed guard, for
                        the purpose of getting my personal effects. I then took possession of my
                        effects with the exception of the following articles, to wit: One
                        chronometer, valued at $125; 1 pair of marine glasses, valued at $25; 1
                        aneroid barometer, valued at $7; 1 thermometer, valued at $1; 1 lot of
                        charts, valued at $25; 1 lot of nautical books, valued at $15; 1 silver
                        watch and gold chain, valued at $40; 7 razors, valued at $15; 1 coal-oil
                        stove and utensils, valued at $3; 1 pair of rubber boots, valued at $5; 1
                        lot of clothing, valued at $25; 2 shotguns, valued at $96; 2 rifles, valued
                        at $32; which I was informed and believe, and therefore allege, to have been
                        stolen by the officers and crew of the said <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>,
                        and which I then and there demanded from the officers of the said cruiser,
                        but which were not then nor afterwards returned to me.</p>
                    <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0255"/>
                    <p>On my return to the <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>, under guard, I was so
                        sick from the exposure hereinabove complained of that I went to bed and
                        asked to see the doctor, and saw him, but he refused to give me any
                        medicine. I then asked to see any of my crew, but was informed that I could
                        not see or speak with or communicate with any of my crew, but was permitted
                        to send through a Russian sailor to my steward, who made me some flaxseed
                        tea, which was all the medicine I could get while suffering from the cold
                        and fever brought on by the exposure complained of; and during my detention
                        on the <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> I could procure no suitable food; and
                        from said exposure, lack of food, brutal treatment, and lack of medicine I
                        suffered great mental and physical pain and agony, and was confined to my
                        bed during the balance of the voyage to Petropaulovsky, at which port we
                        arrived on the 20th day of July, A. D. 1892, as hereinbefore stated. Upon
                        our arrival at said port I was, notwithstanding my sickness, compelled by
                        the Russian officers to go on shore and get along as best I could.</p>
                    <p>Upon landing I went to the governor of Petropaulovsk and demanded assistance.
                        The governor allowed 15 kopecks—worth about 7 cents United States money—per
                        diem for the support of the crew, and I was informed we were all prisoners,
                        and that was all that would be allowed. I then asked for shelter for myself
                        and men, but the only shelter given for my crew, consisting of 10 white men
                        and 4 Indians, together with 24 other men belonging to other vessels which
                        had been seized by the Russians, was a room 10 feet by 18 feet, with a leaky
                        roof and broken windows. I, finding that the Russian officials would not
                        provide other shelter for me, and being then sick, as aforesaid, and fearing
                        death from exposure, asked the master of the American bark <hi rend="italic"
                            >Majestic</hi>, then in port with coal for the Russian Fur Company, for
                        assistance, but he had no spare room, and I obtained permission from him to
                        sleep in the hatch house of the vessel, which was a small room erected at
                        the hatchway, and was about 6 feet square by 6 feet high, and intended for
                        keeping tools, etc. I slept in said hatch house until my arrival at Port
                        Townsend, as hereinafter set forth. The 15 kopecks per day allowed me by the
                        Russian officials would only then purchase at Petropaulovsk one-half of a
                        loaf of bread, which was insufficient to sustain life. I was therefore,
                        having no money, compelled to beg a meal here and there to keep me alive,
                        but was not even by that means enabled to get sufficient food to keep me
                        from suffering from hunger.</p>
                    <p>I, with my crew, was kept at Petropaulovsk prisoner as aforesaid until the
                        8th day of August, A. D. 1892, suffering all the time from the sickness
                        above set forth, and being, during all said period, unable to procure
                        sufficient food or proper treatment. I have been suffering physically ever
                        since, and I am now informed by my physician that I shall probably never
                        fully recover my health.</p>
                    <p>On the 8th day of August, A. D. 1892, the Russian officials informed me that
                        the master of the American bark <hi rend="italic">Majestic</hi> would make
                        arrangements to take us from Petropaulovsk; accordingly I, and the masters
                        of the other vessels which had been seized by the Russians, made
                        arrangements with the master of the said <hi rend="italic">Majestic</hi> to
                        take us with our respective crews—amounting in all to 84 men—to some United
                        States or British port, and we then and there signed a statement of our
                        condition and a request to our respective Governments to pay the owners of
                        said <hi rend="italic">Majestic</hi> for our passage. The Russian officials
                        then allowed us an amount of beans, flour, salt beef, tea, coffee, and
                        sugar, which would equal about two-thirds of the shortest allowance of each
                        which would be permitted by the United States shipping laws, and ordered us
                        all on board the <hi rend="italic">Majestic</hi>, which said vessel carried
                        us to Port Townsend, at which port we arrived on the 31st day of August, A.
                        D. 1892.</p>
                    <p>During the time I was on board said <hi rend="italic">Majestic</hi> I was on
                        short allowance, and suffering much from exposure to the weather consequent
                        on insufficient shelter.</p>
                    <p>I, as master of said schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, duly
                        protested at the time to the captain of the Russian cruiser <hi
                            rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> against the seizure of said vessel, and at
                        the time protested against each and all of the inhuman and cruel acts by the
                        Russian officials hereinbefore complained of, and duly noted a protest on
                        the 5th day of August, A. D. 1892, to the Russian governor of Petropaulovsk,
                        and I, on the 31st day of August, A. D. 1892, duly made a regular marine
                        protest against said seizure and acts hereinbefore complained of to James G.
                        Swan, a notary public in and for Port Townsend, State of Washington, United
                        States of America, immediately upon my arrival at said city, and said city
                        being the first place in the United States at which I arrived.</p>
                    <p>That the seizure of said schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> and all
                        of the cruel and inhuman acts of the officers of the Russian war cruiser <hi
                            rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> and by the Russian officials committed upon
                        me were in violation of the law of nations and of my rights as a citizen of
                        the United States, and in contravention to the treaties existing between the
                        United States and Russia, and that this claim is founded upon the principles
                        of international law and the rights which every nation and every person has
                        upon the <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0256"/>high seas, and upon the
                        fact that all the above-mentioned acts by the Russian Government and its
                        officials were in violation thereof.</p>
                    <p>Wherefore, I hereby request the interposition of the Government of the United
                        States of America against the Russian Government for the presentation of
                        this claim against said Russian Government.</p>

                    <p>The memorial of Andrew Ronning, sometimes called Romney, to the Department of
                        State, respectfully shows:</p>
                    <p>That said Andrew Ronning is now, and was at the time when the claim
                        hereinafter set forth had its origin, a regularly naturalized citizen of the
                        United States, and that he is unable herewith to produce a duly certified
                        copy of his naturalization, but will hereafter produce the same if required;
                        and that he is now, and was at the time when the claim hereinafter set forth
                        had its origin, a resident of the city and county of San Francisco, State of
                        California, and a duly qualified and registered voter therein.</p>
                    <p>That said Andrew Ronning claims from the Russian Government the sum of
                        $15,000, being the entire sum hereby claimed. This claimant believes that
                        the sum so claimed would not reimburse him for the loss and damage sustained
                        by him from the wrongful act of the authorities of the Russian Government
                        hereinafter set forth, and that this claimant has received no money or other
                        equivalent or idemnification from insurance or otherwise for the whole or
                        any part of the loss or injury upon which this claim is founded.</p>
                    <p>That the said claim is based upon the following facts and circumstances, to
                        wit:</p>
                    <p>That I, the said Andrew Ronning, on the 7th day of May, A. D. 1892, was the
                        duly acting and qualified mate of the American schooner <hi rend="italic">C.
                            H. White</hi>, belonging to the Eagle Fishing Company, of San Francisco,
                        Cal., which said vessel on said day cleared from the port of San Francisco
                        for a hunting and fishing voyage in the North Pacific Ocean, having at the
                        time all the necessary and legal papers on board, as will more fully and at
                        large appear by the memorial and papers in support thereof of said Eagle
                        Fishing Company on file in this Department, and that on said day I, as mate,
                        with said vessel and a good and sufficient Crew, did set sail and depart
                        from the port of San Francisco, bound for the North Pacific Ocean, said
                        vessel being at that time and at all the times hereinafter mentioned
                        seaworthy and in all respects fit for the voyage which it took, as herein
                        mentioned. I proceeded with said vessel on my voyage without disaster of any
                        kind until the 15th day of July, A. D. 1892, and that prior to said day, and
                        in the open Pacific Ocean, more than 30 miles south of the Aleutian Islands,
                        and not in Russian waters, had caught 8 barrels of mackerel and 1 ton of
                        codfish, and had killed 20 seals, all of which were caught and killed on the
                        voyage from San Francisco, and more than 30 miles south of the Aleutian
                        Islands, and not in Russian waters; that about the 12th day of July, A. D.
                        1892, I being then fishing about 40 miles south of Agattou Island, one of
                        the Aleutian Islands, with said vessel and crew, set sail for the Kurile
                        Islands, off the coast of Japan, intending to fish there, and the master
                        then finding that the chronometer was out, wanted to sight land to correct
                        his chronometer, and accordingly deviated from the course or route to the
                        Kurile Islands for the purpose of sighting either Copper or Bering Islands
                        to correct the chronometer, and on the 15th day of July we arrived at
                        latitude 54° 18’ north, longitude 167° 19’ east, by correct observation, and
                        had not fished or sealed in said place nor at any place within 50 miles
                        thereof, or in Russian waters at all, and the wind being light, but the
                        vessel sailing on its course as aforesaid, and no boats being out from said
                        vessel either for hunting or fishing, and neither I nor anyone from said
                        vessel being either hunting or fishing.</p>
                    <p>Said latitude 54° 18’ north, longitude 167° 19’ east, is by correct
                        observation measured by the master on the United States Coast Survey Chart,
                        No. 900, more than 80 miles from Copper or Bering Islands on the high seas,
                        and not in Russian waters, when at said time, and in the latitude and
                        longitude above mentioned, on the 15th day of July, A. D. 1892, as
                        aforesaid, and not being at the time hunting or fishing, and not having at
                        any time fished or hunted seals in Russian waters, but being at said time on
                        its course for the Kurile Islands, as aforesaid, the said schooner was
                        boarded by an officer from the Russian war cruiser <hi rend="italic"
                            >Zabiaca</hi>, which said war cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> was
                        at all the times herein mentioned a steamer regularly commissioned as a
                        cruiser and belonging to the Russian Government, armed for offensive and
                        defensive warfare, and acting under the authority and by the directions of
                        the Russian Government, and the master was by said officer ordered to come
                        on board of said cruiser with all the schooner’s papers. He accordingly went
                        on board. Shortly afterwards the captain of said cruiser had me as well as
                        all the crew of said schooner brought on board of said cruiser, and I, with
                        the rest of the crew of said schooner, was then and there arrested, and I
                        was sent with an armed prize crew back to the schooner <hi rend="italic">C.
                            H. White</hi>, and I remained a prisoner upon said schooner until it
                        arrived at Petropaulovsky on the——day of July, 1892. During the voyage to
                        Petropaulovsky the following articles belonging to me were stolen by the
                        Russians: Two nautical books, valued at $10; 1 pair rubber boots, valued at
                        $5; 1 oil-coat, valued at $5; 3 suits of <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238"
                            facs="0258"/>underclothes, valued at $9; 7 pairs of socks, valued at
                        $3.50; 1 watch and chain, valued at $23; 1 razor, valued at $3; 2
                        pocketknives, valued at $2; and, notwithstanding my repeated demands for
                        them, they were never returned to me.</p>
                    <p>Upon landing at Petropaulovsky the master went to the governor and demanded
                        assistance. The governor allowed 15 kopecks (worth about 7 cents United
                        States money) per diem for the support of each of the crew, and was informed
                        that we were all prisoners, and that no more money would be allowed for our
                        support, and then asked for shelter for his crew; but the only shelter given
                        me and the rest of the crew (consisting of 10 white men and 4 Indians,
                        together with 24 other men belonging to other vessels which had been seized
                        by the Russians) was a room 10 feet by 18 feet, with a leaky roof and broken
                        windows, in which I was compelled to live during my stay in Petropaulovsky,
                        which lasted till the 8th day of August, A. D. 1892, and during that time I
                        had to live upon a half loaf of bread each day (that being all the 15
                        kopecks allowed by the Russian Government would then buy); the bread,
                        together with what I could beg, was not sufficient to keep me from hunger.
                        From the exposure to the damp and foggy weather during my imprisonment at
                        Petropaulovsky, and from the insufficient food, I suffered great physical
                        pain, from the effects of which I have not yet recovered.</p>
                    <p>On the 8th of August provision was made for the passage of myself and the
                        other prisoners at Petropaulovsky (84 in all) to some American or British
                        port. Accordingly, on said last-named day I was driven on board of the
                        American bark <hi rend="italic">Majestic</hi>, where, on account of
                        insufficient food and accommodation, I suffered greatly during my passage to
                        Port Townsend, where I arrived on the 31st day of August, A. D. 1893.</p>
                    <p>That many of the facts constituting the cruel acts by the Russian officials
                        and showing their lack of humanity in matters pertaining to this claim are
                        not in my direct knowledge, but are more fully and at large set forth in the
                        memorandum of Lawrence M. Furman, of said schooner,<hi rend="italic">C. H.
                            White</hi>, to which said memorial reference is hereby made in support
                        hereof.</p>
                    <p>The master of the said schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> duly
                        protested at the time to the captain of the Russian cruiser <hi
                            rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> against the seizure of the said vessel, and
                        at the time protested against each and all the inhuman and cruel acts by the
                        Russian officials hereinbefore complained of, and duly noted a protest on
                        the 5th day of August A. D. 1892, to the Russian governor of Petropaulovsky;
                        and on the 31st day of August, A. D. 1892, duly made a regular marine
                        protest against said seizure and acts hereinbefore complained of to James G.
                        Swan, a notary public in and for Port Townsend, State of Washington, United
                        States of America, immediately upon my arrival at said city, and said city
                        being the first place in the United States at which I arrived, all of which
                        said protest made before James G. Swan as aforesaid was also signed by
                        me.</p>
                    <p>That the seizure of said schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, and all
                        of the cruel and inhuman acts by the officers of the Russian war cruiser <hi
                            rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>, and by the Russian officials committed upon
                        me, were in violation of the law of nations and of my rights as a citizen of
                        the United States, and in contravention to the treaties existing between the
                        United States and Russia, and that this claim is founded upon the principles
                        of international law and the rights which every person and every nation has
                        upon the high seas, and upon the fact that all the above-mentioned acts by
                        the Russian Government and its officials were in violation thereof.</p>
                    <p>Wherefore I hereby request the interposition of the Government of the United
                        States of America against the Russian Government for the presentation of
                        this claim against the said Russian Government.</p>

                    <p>The memorial of Neils Wolfgang to the Department of State respectfully shows:
                        That the said Neils Wolfgang is now and was at the time when the claim
                        hereinafter set forth had its origin a regularly naturalized citizen of the
                        United States, and that he is unable to produce herewith a duly certified
                        copy of the record of his naturalization, but will hereafter produce the
                        same if required; and that he is now, and was at the time when the claim
                        hereinafter set forth had its origin, a resident of the city and county of
                        San Francisco, State of California, and a duly qualified and registered
                        voter therein.</p>
                    <p>That said Neils Wolfgang claims from the Russian Government the sum of
                        $10,000, being the entire sum hereby claimed; this claimant believes that
                        the sum so claimed would not reimburse him for the loss and damage sustained
                        by him from the wrongful act of the authorities of the Russian Government
                        hereinafter set forth, and that this claimant has received no money or other
                        equivalent or indemnification from insurance or otherwise for the whole or
                        any part of the loss or injury upon which this claim is founded.</p>
                    <p>That the said claim is based upon the following facts and circumstances, to
                        wit:</p>
                    <p>That I, the said Neils Wolfgang, on the 7th day of May, A. D. 1892, was a
                        duly acting and qualified hunter on the American schooner <hi rend="italic"
                            >C. H. White</hi>, belonging to the Eagle Fishing Company, of San
                        Francisco, Cal., which said vessel on said day cleared from said port of San
                        Francisco for a hunting and fishing voyage in the North Pacific Ocean,
                        having at the time all the necessary and legal papers on board, as will more
                        fully and at large appear by the memorial and papers in support thereof of
                        said Eagle Fishing Company on file in this Department, and that on said day
                        I, as hunter with <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0260"/>said vessel, and
                        a good and sufficient crew, did set sail and depart from said port of San
                        Francisco, bound for the North Pacific Ocean, said vessel being at that time
                        and at all the times hereinafter mentioned seaworthy and in all respects fit
                        for the voyage which it took, as herein mentioned. I proceeded with said
                        vessel on my voyage without disaster of any kind until the 15th day of July,
                        A. D. 1892, and that prior to that day and in the open Pacific Ocean, more
                        than 30 miles south of the Aleutian Islands, and not in Russian waters, had
                        caught 8 barrels of mackerel and 1 ton of codfish, and had killed 20 seals,
                        all of which were caught and killed on the voyage from San Francisco, and
                        more than 30 miles south of the Aleutian Islands, and not in Russian waters;
                        and that about the 12th day of July, A. D. 1892, I being then fishing about
                        40 miles south of Agattou Island, one of the Aleutian Islands, with said
                        vessel and crew, set sail for the Kurile Islands, off the coast of Japan,
                        intending to fish there; and the master then finding that the chronometer
                        was out, wanted to sight land to correct the chronometer, and accordingly
                        deviated from the course of route to the Kurile Islands for the purpose of
                        sighting either Copper or Bering Island to correct the chronometer, and on
                        the 15th day of July we arrived at latitude 54° 18’ north, longitude 167°
                        19’ east, by correct observation, and had not fished or sealed in said
                        place, nor at any place within 50 miles thereof, or in Russian waters at
                        all, and the wind being light, but the vessel sailing on its course as
                        aforesaid, and no boats being out from said vessel, either for hunting or
                        fishing, and neither I nor anyone from said vessel being either hunting or
                        fishing.</p>
                    <p>Said latitude 54° 18’ north, longitude 167° 19’ east, is by correct
                        observation measured by the master on the United States Coast Survey Chart,
                        No. 900, more than 80 miles from Copper or Bering Islands on the high seas,
                        and not in Russian waters; when at the said time, and in the latitude and
                        longitude above mentioned, on the 15th day of July A. D. 1892, as aforesaid,
                        and not being at the time hunting or fishing, and not having at any time
                        fished or hunted seals in Russian waters, but being at said time on its
                        course for the Kurile Islands as aforesaid, the said schooner was boarded by
                        an officer from the Russian war cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>,
                        which said war crusier <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> was, at all the times
                        herein mentioned, a steamer regularly commissioned as a war cruiser, and
                        belonging to the Russian Government, armed for offensive and defensive
                        warfare, and acting under the authority and by the directions of the said
                        Russian Government, and the master was, by said officer, ordered to come on
                        board of said cruiser with all the schooner’s papers; he accordingly went on
                        board. Shortly afterwards the captain had me, as well as all the crew of
                        said schooner, brought on board of said cruiser, and I, with the rest of the
                        crew of said schooner, was then and there arrested, and was kept a prisoner
                        on board of said cruiser until its arrival at Petropaulovsk on the 20th day
                        of July, A. D. 1892, and whileon said cruiser I had no other clothing than
                        those in which I stood, and suffered from exposure to the weather and from
                        the insufficient food allowed me.</p>
                    <p>The following articles were stolen from me by the Russians: 1 lot of
                        underwear, valued at $7; 1 lot of shoes, valued at $4.50; 1 pair of pants,
                        valued at $7; 1 oilskin coat, valued at $3.50; 1 lot of socks, valued at $2;
                        1 pair of rubber boots, valued at $5; 1 gold ring, valued at $9; 1 knife,
                        valued at 75 cents; 9 sealskins, valued at $18; and, notwithstanding my
                        repeated demands for them, they were never returned to me.</p>
                    <p>Upon landing at Petropaulovsk the master went to the governor and demanded
                        assistance. The governor allowed 15 kopecks—worth about 7 cents United
                        States money—per diem for the support of each of the crew, and was informed
                        that we were all prisoners, and that no more money would be allowed for our
                        support. He then asked for shelter for his crew, but the only shelter given
                        me and the rsst of the crew—consisting of 10 white men and 4 Indians,
                        together with 24 other men belonging to other vessels which had been seized
                        by the Russians—was a room 10 feet by 18 feet, with a leaky roof and broken
                        windows, in which I was compelled to live during my stay in Petropaulovsk,
                        which lasted until the 8th day of August, A. D. 1892, and during that time I
                        had to live upon half a loaf of bread each day (that being all the 15
                        kopecks allowed by the Russian Government would then buy); the bread,
                        together with what I could beg, was not sufficient to keep me from hunger.
                        From the exposure to the damp and foggy weather during my imprisonment at
                        Petropaulovsky, and from insufficient food, I suffered great physical pain,
                        from the eflects of which I have not yet recovered.</p>
                    <p>On the 8th day of August provision was made for the passage of myself and the
                        others at Petropaulovsky (84 in all) to some American or British port.
                        Accordingly, on said last-named day, I was driven on board the American bark
                            <hi rend="italic">Majestic</hi>, where, on account of insufficient food
                        and accommodation, I suffered greatly during my passage to Port Townsend,
                        where I arrived on the 31st day of August, A. D. 1892.</p>
                    <p>That many of the facts constituting the cruel acts by the Russian officials,
                        and showing their lack of humanity in matters pertaining to this claim, are
                        not in my <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0261"/>direct knowledge, but are
                        more fully and at large set forth in the memorial of Lawrence M. Furman,
                        master of said schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, to which said
                        memorial reference is hereby made in support hereof.</p>
                    <p>The master of said schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> duly protested
                        at the time to the captain Of the Russian cruiser <hi rend="italic"
                            >Zabiaca</hi>, against the seizure of the said vessel, and at the time
                        protested against each and all of the inhuman and cruel acts by the Russian
                        officials hereinbefore complained of, and duly noted a protest on the 5th
                        day of August, A. D. 1892, to the Russian governor of Petropaulovsky; and on
                        the 31st day of August, A. D. 1892, duly made a regular marine protest
                        against such seizure and acts hereinbefore complained of to James G. Swan, a
                        notary public in and for Port Townsend, State of Washington, United States
                        of America, immediately upon my arrival at said city, and said city being
                        the first place in the United States at which I arrived, all of which
                        protests were made on my behalf, and the protest made before James G. Swan,
                        as aforesaid, was also signed by me.</p>
                    <p>That the seizure of the said schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, and
                        all the cruel and inhuman acts by the officers of the Russian war cruiser
                            <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>, and by the Russian officials committed
                        upon me were in violation of the law of nations, and of my right as a
                        citizen of the United States, and in contravention to the treaties existing
                        between the United States and Russia; and that this claim is founded upon
                        the principles of international law, and the rights which every nation and
                        every person has upon the high seas, and upon the fact that all the
                        above-mentioned acts by the Russian Government and its officials were in
                        violation thereof.</p>
                    <p>Wherefore I hereby request the interposition of the Government of the United
                        States of America against the Russian Government for the presentation of
                        this claim against said Russian Government.</p>

                        notary, at my office, personally appeared L. M. Furman, late master of the
                        American schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, belonging to the port
                        of San Francisco, Cal. (the said master having previously noted in due form
                        of law his intention to protest), who, together with Andrew Romney, mate,
                        and Niels Wolfgang, hunter, belonging to the aforesaid vessel, being by me
                        duly sworn according to the laws of said State and of the United States of
                        America, voluntarily and solemnly did depose and declare as follows, to wit,
                        that they, the said appearers, on the 7th day of May, A. D. 1892, set sail
                        and departed in and with the said vessel from the port of San Francisco,
                        Cal., having on board a hunting and fishing outfit and bound for the North
                        Pacific Ocean, the said vessel being then stout, staunch, and strong; her
                        ballast, cargo, and stores well and sufficiently stowed and secured; well
                        masted, manned, tackled, victualed, appareled, and appointed, and in every
                        respect fit for sea and the voyage she was then about to undertake; that we
                        proceeded on our voyage without disaster of any kind until the 15th day of
                        July, A. D. 1892, when, being at that time on the high seas, in latitude 54°
                        18’ north, longitude 167° 19’ east, by correct observation; on the high
                        seas, more than 30 miles from land, we were boarded by an officer from the
                        Russian cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>, Captain Deleveron, who
                        ordered me to go on board the <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> with all my
                        papers, as the captain of the cruiser wanted to see my papers and me
                        also.</p>
                    <p>I accordingly went on board in the officer’s boat, and when Captain Deleveron
                        had examined my papers and found that I had cleared for hunting and fishing,
                        he arrested me and put me under a guard of four marines armed, and ordered
                        me to be kept separate from the crew and not to be allowed to speak to
                        anybody. He then took all hands out of the schooner, except the mate, and
                        put them under guard on board the cruiser, after searching them and taking
                        from them everything they had, but the clothes they stood in. He then took
                        the steamer in tow, and towed her to Nicolavisky Bay, Bering Island. It took
                        twelve hours to tow us from where we were seized to Bering Island, where we
                        arrived on the 16th of July at 10 o’clock a.m. The cruiser and schooner were
                        anchored near each other. After we had anchored Captain Deleveron called me
                        into his cabin and told me that the United States steamer <hi rend="italic"
                            >Albatross</hi>, Captain Tanner, had been to Bering Island and had
                        instructed him to seize any vessel he might come across which had a sealing
                        outfit on board. He also <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0263"/>showed me
                        a list which Captain Tanner had given him of all the vessels which had
                        cleared at San Francisco for hunting and fishing. The <hi rend="italic">C.
                            H. White’s</hi> name was not on that list, as I left San Francisco after
                        the <hi rend="italic">Albatross</hi> had sailed for the north. Captain
                        Deleveron also showed me the proclamation and other American Government
                        papers which Captain Tanner had left with him, but I did not read those
                        papers. Captain Deleveron also told me that he could seize any sealing
                        vessels from 1 mile to 1,000 miles off shore, he did not care where they
                        were. I told him that I had a clearance from the San Francisco custom-house
                        for a hunting and fishing voyage in the North Pacific Ocean, and I claimed
                        that I was in the North Pacific Ocean at the time I was seized. He said it
                        did not matter it was in Russian waters. I said that the fishing limits are
                        3 leagues or 9 miles off shore, and I was a long way outside of that limit.
                        He said that it made no difference.</p>
                    <p>By actual measurement of the General Chart of Alaska, No. 900, United States
                        Coast Survey, 1890, I make my position latitude 54° 18’ north. The Russians
                        made it latitude 54° 30’ north. My distance by my measurement was 80 miles
                        to the south of Bering Island, and the Russians make it 70 miles by their
                        own statement. I consider my vessel as being at least 70 miles outside the
                        limit set by all civilized nations as their jurisdiction over the high
                        seas.</p>
                    <p>After I had undergone this court-martial I was told by Captain Deleveron that
                        I might go on board the schooner and get my personal effects. I went on
                        board the schooner the same day, July 16, and found that my room had been
                        robbed and everything of value taken away. A list of articles lost is
                        herewith filed and becomes a part of this protest, together with the bills
                        of the officers and Indians as claims. The next day (July 17) I was called
                        to the cabin, and a paper in the Russian language, which I do not
                        understand, was presented to me to sign. I refused to sign what I did not
                        comprehend, and protested against this injustice. Captain Deleveron told me
                        I could have my choice, either to sign the paper or go to Vladivostock and
                        be court-martialed and sent to Siberia, as I would have no one to defend me.
                        I then signed the paper under protest, which I was given to understand was
                        an acknowledgment on my part that I had been sealing in Russian waters.</p>
                    <p>July 18 we left Bering Island for Petropaulousk and arrived there on the
                        20th.</p>
                    <p>On the 5th of August I noted a protest with the governor of Petropaulousk,
                        which was translated into Russian language for me by a Russian who could
                        speak and write English. The governor read the protest, and then signed my
                        original in English.</p>
                    <p>On the 8th of August I went on board the cruiser to see the captain, but he
                        refused to see me, and I was driven out of the ship. After I got ashore a
                        detachment of marines was sent from the cruiser, and drove us all on board
                        the American bark <hi rend="italic">Majestic</hi>, then lying at anchor in
                        Petropaulousk Harbor. She left on the following morning for Victoria, B. C.,
                        where we arrived August 30 at 2 o’clock p.m.</p>
                    <p>During the time we were prisoners at Petropaulousk we were only allowed 7
                        cents per day for our subsistence, the regular allowance to Russian
                        prisoners, and provisions being high we could only obtain three biscuits, or
                        half a pound of bread, which constituted our food each day. And I, in behalf
                        of the owners of said schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, the crew
                        and myself, do protest against said seizure of said vessel and the total
                        confiscation of all our property by the said Russian cruiser <hi
                            rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> and her commander, Deleveron, reserving to
                        myself the right, on behalf of all parties concerned, to still further
                        extend this protest if need be.</p>
                    <p>And the said appearers further declare that as all the damage and injury
                        which already has or may hereafter appear to have happened or accrued to the
                        said vessel, her freight, and cargo has been occasioned solely by the
                        circumstances hereinbefore stated, and can not or ought not to be attributed
                        to any insufficiency of the said vessel, the neglect or default of him, this
                        deponent, his officers, or crew. He now requires me, the said notary, to
                        make his protest and this public act thereof that the same may serve and be
                        of full force and value, as of right shall appertain. And thereupon the said
                        master protested, and I, the said notary, at his special instance and
                        request, did, as by these presents I now do publicly and solemnly, protest
                        against winds, weather, and seas, and against all and every accident, matter
                        and thing, had and met with as aforesaid, whereby or by means whereof the
                        said vessel, her freight, or her cargo already has or hereafter shall have
                        suffered or sustained loss, damage, or injury, and for all losses, costs,
                        charges, expenses, damages, and injury which the said vessel, or the owner
                        and owners of the said vessel, or the owner or owners or shippers of her
                        said cargo, or any other person or persons interested or concerned in it
                        either, already have been or may hereafter be called upon to pay, sustain,
                        incur, or be put unto, by or on account of the premises, or for which the
                        insurer or insurers of the said vessel, her freight, or her cargo, is or are
                        respectively liable to pay or make contributions or average according to
                        custom, or their respective contract or <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244"
                            facs="0264"/>obligations, so that no part of any losses, damages,
                        injuries, or expenses already incurred Or hereafter to be incurred do fall
                        on him, the said master, his officers, or crew.</p>
                    <p>Thus done and protested in Port Townsend this 1st day of September. A. D.
                        1892.</p>
                    <p>In testimony whereof, as well as the said appearers, I, the notary, have
                        subscribed these presents, and I have also caused my seal of office to be

                        and hunter of the American schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>,
                        seized by the Russian cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> on the 15th day
                        of July, 1892. These claims are fully set forth in the inclosed copies of
                        the following documents: <list>

                        </list></p>
                    <p>It appears that the schooner was owned by the Eagle Fishing Company, an
                        American corporation, the shareholders of which were at the time of the
                        seizure, and still are, American citizens. Indeed, all of the claimants and
                        officers as well as all the white men of the crew, except Julias Furman, at
                        the time of the seizure were, and still are, citizens of the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>The schooner regularly cleared from San Francisco May 7, 1892, bound on a
                        fishing and hunting voyage to the North Pacific Ocean, having on board a
                        fishing and hunting outfit and a crew of 10 white men and 4 Indians.</p>
                    <p>She took neither fish nor seals in Russian waters, nor does she seem to have
                        ever visited Russian waters. Yet in latitude 54° 18’ N., longitude 167° 18’
                        E., a point more than 80 miles from Copper or Bering Islands, and of course
                        even more remote from the mainland or any other Rssian island, she was on
                        the 15th day of July, 1892, seized, as before stated, by the Russian war
                        cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca.</hi></p>
                    <p>The officers and crew were treated as prisoners, and the schooner was towed
                        by her captors to Bering Island. Thence she was sent in charge of a prize
                        crew to Petropaulovsky, and her owners are informed that she is now in the
                        possession and use of the Russian Government.</p>
                    <p>The protracted injustice and cruelty alleged by these men is recited in the
                        inclosed memorials with harrowing particularity.</p>
                    <p>The master states that the Russian officers, presumably to cover up such
                        transactions, compelled him in his helpless condition, and with the threat
                        to send him to Siberia, to sign a paper in the Russian language, which he
                        did not understand.</p>
                    <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0267"/>
                    <p>My Government is very far from having any desire to protect from just
                        punishment any of its citizens who enter the limits of another power and
                        violate its laws. Nor do I imagine for a moment that the Imperial Government
                        is without the most proper concern in regard to the conduct of its officers
                        in those distant parts of the world. But here is a case where our citizens
                        seem to have been engaged in a perfectly lawful pursuit, and under
                        circumstances that do not touch in any degree the rights, interests, or
                        jurisdiction of Russia. Every right, interest, and sentiment seems to have
                        been totally disregarded.</p>
                    <p>Other memorials of this character, from the same quarter, have been presented
                        by my Government; and I must ask your excellency to have this and similar
                        cases pending made the subject of prompt and searching inquiry, to the end
                        that such wrongs, if these allegations be true, may be prevented in the
                        future, and that justice may be done for the past.</p>
                    <p>I avail myself of this occasion to renew to your excellency the assurance of
                        my most distinguished consideration.</p>

                        public in and for said city and county of San Francisco, State of

                        witness, and being first duly sworn, deposes and says:</p>
                    <p>I am the president of the Eagle Fishing Company, which said company owned the
                            <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> in 1892, when she was seized by the

                        fully appear by the memorial of said company on file herein.</p>
                    <p>The damage to said company for the loss of said vessel is placed by the said
                        company in said memorial at the sum of $100,000, and is itemized as follows:
                        Value of schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> and outfit, $35,000;
                        value of 20 sealskins which were seized, $280; value of 8 barrels of
                        mackerel seized, $160; value of 1 ton of codfish seized, $260; value of
                        probable catch of codfish and mackerel after the seizure of the vessel,
                        $10,300; and probable value of catch of seals during the remainder of the
                        sealing season, about $54,000; and I further say that the said sum of
                        $100,000 will not reimburse said company fully for the seizure and loss of

                        duly sworn, says:</p>
                    <p>My age is 62 years. I was born in Denmark. My residence is Alameda, Cal. I am
                        now, and since 1865 have been, a duly naturalized citizen of the United
                        States. My residence at the time the events took place in regard to which I
                        am testifying and deposing was Alameda, Cal. My occupation is now, and was
                        at the time the events took place in regard to which I am testifying and
                        deposing, shipping merchant, but I, as then and prior thereto, and
                        subsequently thereafter until now, have been managing owner and part owner
                        of sealing vessels, and otherwise interested in the sealing business. I am
                        not interested, either directly or indirectly, in the said claim, nor have I
                        any contingent interest in the same. I am not the agent or attorney of the
                        claimant making the above claim, nor of any person whatever interested
                        therein. I will not be entitled to receive any part of any sum which may be
                        awarded under said claim to said claimant. Since 1885, when I first became
                        interested in the sealing business, I have been managing owner of the
                        following vessels engaged in the sealing business, viz, the <hi
                            rend="italic">Mary H. Thomas</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Alexander</hi>,
                        the <hi rend="italic">Herman</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Alton</hi>, and
                        I am well acquainted with the value of sealing vessels and the outfits for
                        the same. I knew the <hi rend="italic">C. H White</hi>, her tonnage, and
                        capacity well. I am advised as to her outfit and equipment. I knew L. M.
                        Furman, the master thereof, and consider him a competent master,
                        understanding the sealing business, and know that the master, outfit,
                        equipment, and men of the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, in 1892, at
                        the time she cleared from the port of San Francisco for the voyage during
                        which she was seized by the Russian cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>,
                        were fully sufficient and competent for the purpose of sealing and fishing,
                        and I know that the said <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> was fully fit
                        for the purpose of sealing and fishing. I verily believe that the schooner
                            <hi rend="italic">C. H White</hi>, with its equipment and outfit, at the
                        time it cleared from the port of San Francisco in 1892, when it was seized
                        by the Russian war cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>, was fully worth

                        sworn, deposes and says:</p>
                    <p>My age is 46 years. I was born at Hull, England. I arrived in the city and
                        county of San Francisco in 1870, and have been a duly naturalized citizen of
                        the United States since 1876. My residence is now, and was at the time the
                        events took place in regard to which I am testifying and deposing, No. 629
                        Broadway, San Francisco, Cal. My occupation is now wholesale shipping
                        butcher; my occupation at the time the events took place In regard to which
                        I am testifying and deposing was wholesale shipping butcher, but I was then
                        and prior thereto and subsequently thereafter interested as managing owner
                        of sealing vessels, and otherwise interested in the sealing business. I am
                        not interested, either directly or indirectly, in the said claim, nor have I
                        any contingent interest in the same. I am not the agent or attorney of the
                        claimant making the above claim, nor of any person whatever interested
                        therein. I will not be entitled to receive any part of any sum which may be
                        awarded under said claim to said claimant.</p>
                    <p>I know the said schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> well. The vessel
                        was built in 1887 by C. H. White, a shipbuilder of San Francisco. She was
                        then well worth the sum of $15,000, having cost that much to build. I, with
                        William Bent and others, purchased the schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                            White</hi> from the said builder in 1888, and we fitted her out for
                        hunting seals at a total expense of $13,000. I was managing owner of the
                        said schooner until 1891 or 1892, when we sold her to the Eagle Fishing
                        Company, and I know that in the spring of 1892 the equipment was worth, for
                        the purpose of sealing and fishing, all it cost us when new, $13,000, for we
                        had kept up the equipment in as good a condition as new, and the schooner
                        was then, in 1892, well worth what it had cost to build, $15,000; and I
                        examined the said schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, and its
                        outfit and equipment in 1892, just before she cleared for the voyage in the
                        North Pacific Ocean, during which voyage she was seized by the Russian war
                        cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca;</hi> and I know her value, and also in a
                        general way what the Eagle Fishing Company expended upon her<note n="a"
                            xml:id="comp4fna">The word “here” has been corrected to read “her,” as
                            above noted.—<hi rend="smallcaps">W. T. Hess.</hi></note> to fit her out
                        and man her for said voyage; and her value for the purpose of sealing and
                        fishing was not less than $35,000 at the time she was seized as
                        aforesaid.</p>

                        public in and for said city and county of San Francisco, State of

                        Lutgens, sometimes called Claus Lutgens, personally known to me to be a
                        credible witness, who being first duly sworn, deposes and says:</p>
                    <p>I am not interested either directly or indirectly in the said claim, nor have
                        I any contingent interest in the same. I am not the agent or attorney of the
                        claimant making the above claim, nor of any person interested therein. I
                        will not be entitled to receive any part of any sum which may be awarded
                        under said claim to said claimant. My age is 59 years; my place of birth was
                        North Germany. I arrived in the city and county of San Francisco in 1869,
                        and I have been a duly naturalized citizen of the United States since about
                        1875. I have been a sailor or seaman for 38 years, and have been a master
                        mariner since 1872. I am now a master mariner. At the time the events took
                        place in regard to which I am now testifying and deposing I was a master
                        mariner, and master and owner of the American schooner <hi rend="italic"
                            >Kate and Anna</hi>, and am now the owner thereof. My residence is now
                        at Alameda, Cal., and my residence at the time the events took place in
                        relation to which I am testifying and deposing was San Francisco, Cal.
                        During the season of 1892, I was sealing and hunting in the North Pacific
                        Ocean as owner and master of said schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and
                            Anna</hi>. I have been in the sealing business since 1886; I was master
                        and owner of said schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> until 1896,
                        and since 1896 up to the present time, I am the owner of said schooner <hi
                            rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> and am engaged in the sealing business.
                        I am well acquainted with the schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>. I
                        saw her in the year 1890, and I saw the said schooner in 1892 at the time it
                        cleared for the voyage during which it was seized by the Russian cruiser <hi
                            rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>. I was informed as to the date of the seizure
                        of said schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> on July 15, 1892. I know
                        the master of said schooner, L. M. Furman, to have been a competent master,
                        understanding the sealing business, and I know the equipment of the vessel
                        to have been sufficient for the purpose of sealing and fishing. I was
                        sealing in the North Pacific Ocean during the year 1892 as master and owner
                        of the schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>, and am fully able to
                        judge as to the probable number of seals which ‘the said schooner <hi
                            rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> would reasonably be expected to catch
                        during the season of 1892 after its seizure as aforesaid. I know the value
                        of the seal skins in the London market during the year 1892 to have been $14
                        each, because I sold 1,252 seal skins that year at that price. I estimated
                        that the probable catch of the schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>
                        for the season of 1892, subsequent to its seizure on July 15th, 1892, would
                        have been at least 2,400 seal skins, worth as aforesaid $14 each, and the
                        probable and reasonable value thereof would have been $33,600.</p>

                        reside at No. 9 Essex street, San Francisco, Cal. I am by occupation a

                        country. He was always called Lars M. Furman in Sweden. I know that his true
                        name is Lars M. Furman, and I know him to be the same person who makes claim
                        against the Russian Government under the name of Lawrence M. Furman.</p>

                    <p>Andrew Olson, also known as Andrew Ronning, being duly sworn, deposes and
                        says: I was born in Norway in the year 1853. I have been a citizen of the
                        United States since March 5, 1883. I reside at No. 10 Jackson street, San
                        Francisco, Cal.; I am by occupation a seafaring man. I am the same person
                        who makes claim against the Russian Government under the name of Andrew
                        Ronning. My father’s name was Ole Andreason Ronning, and in accordance with
                        the custom of the country in which I was born, to wit, Norway, I was
                        christened Andrew Olson. I was sometimes called Andrew Ronning in Norway.
                        After I came to San Francisco, and subsequent to receiving my naturalization

                        business, and in order to avoid confusion, and finding it to be the custom
                        in the United States for the son to take the last name of his father as his
                        own last name, I used the name of Andrew Ronning and shipped on the vessel
                            <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> under the said name of Andrew
                        Ronning, and for the same reason I used the name of Andrew Ronning in making
                        my claim against the Russian Government.</p>
                    <p>I furthermore depose and say that there is no other reason for the change of
                        my name than as above stated.</p>

                        reside at No. 1½ Cedar avenue, San Francisco, Cal. I am by occupation a
                        seafaring man. I have known Andrew Olson for the last twenty years. I knew

                        Norway to give the child the last name Olson where the father’s first name
                        is Ole. I know him to be the person who makes claim against the Russian

                        1890. I reside at 29½ Fourteenth street, San Francisco, Cal. I am by
                        occupation a seafaring man. I have known Andrew Olsen from childhood in
                        Norway, and in this country since I arrived here. I know his father. His
                        father’s name was Ole Andreason Ronning, and while he was usually called
                        Andrew Olsen in Norway, yet I have heard him called Andrew Ronning there. I
                        am familiar with the custom of Norway in regard to patronymics. It is a

                        him to be the same person who makes claim against the Russian Government

                <p>The said schooner was duly enrolled and registered at the port of San Francisco
                    and was duly and regularly cleared from said port of San Francisco on March 1,
                    1892, bound upon a hunting and fishing voyage in the North Pacific Ocean or
                    elsewhere as her master might direct, and the said schooner was in all respects
                    sea worthy and well and sufficiently manned, victualed, furnished, and equipped
                    for a vessel in the merchant service and particularly for the voyage she was

                <p>Proceeding upon his voyage as aforesaid the said master and owner took the said

                    were duly preserved and stored within the said vessel.</p>
                <p>And upon the 12th day of August in the same year, to wit, 1892, when in latitude
                    54° 9’ north and longitude 168° 21′ east, by correct observation, a point upon
                    the high seas without the jurisdiction and territorial waters of any nation and
                    more than 30 miles from the nearest Russian land, and while sailing in a
                    southwesterly course and no one from said vessel being either hunting or
                    fishing, the said Claus Lutjens was compelled, by an armed cruiser of the
                    Imperial Russian navy, namely, the <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>, a cruiser
                    regularly armed, equipped, and commissioned as a man-of-war by the Imperial
                    Government of Russia, to come to. And the said schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate
                        and Anna</hi> having come to the said cruiser the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Zabiaca</hi> came alongside of her and the commanding officer of the said
                        <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> ordered the master of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Kate and Anna</hi> to come on board of the cruiser and to bring with him
                    the said schooner’s papers. Accordingly the said Claus Lutjens, master and owner
                    of the said schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>, took the logbook of
                    his said vessel and her other official papers and went on board of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> and delivered the said papers to the commanding
                    officer of <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0280"/>the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Zabiaca</hi> for his examination. And the said commanding officer made an
                    entry in the said logbook to the effect that the <hi rend="italic">Kate and
                        Anna</hi> was arrested in latitude 54° 9′ north, longitude 168° 21′ east,
                    and not in Russian waters, but because the said logbook did not disprove that
                    she has been sealing on the sealing ground of the Commander Islands her seals
                    were confiscated. And the said commanding officer of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Zabiaca</hi> then and there ordered him to send on board of the said <hi
                        rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> all of his seal skins, to cease sealing, and to
                    return to his home. And the said Claus Lutjens, under fear of the guns and
                    armament of the said Russian war cruiser, and believing that if he failed to
                    obey the said orders that his vessel would be seized and confiscated, did send
                    on board of the <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> all his seal skins, which were
                    then and there confiscated, and to his great loss and injury ceased sealing and
                    taking his schooner, returned to San Francisco forthwith. And at the time of the
                    arrest of his vessel and the confiscation of his seal skins, the said Lutjens
                    protested to the commanding office of the <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> against
                    all of the aforesaid injurious acts, and upon his arrival in San Francisco, or
                    as soon thereafter as he conveniently could, the said Claus Lutjens, went before
                    one Harry J. Lask, a notary public, in and for the city and county of San
                    Francisco, State of California, and before him duly made a regular marine
                    protest.</p>
                <p>In support of these allegations the following documents are hereto annexed and
                    submitted in evidence, to wit: <list>

                <p>And thereafter the said Claus Lutjens addressed a memorial to the Government of

                <p>The first article of the treaty of 1824 between the United States and Russia
                    reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It is agreed that in any part of the great ocean, commonly called the

                            conditions determined by the following articles.</p>
                    </quote></p>
                <p>This article is practically identical with the first article of the treaty of
                    1825 between Russia and Great Britain.</p>
                <p>In the course of the arbitration proceedings held under the treaty concluded
                    between the United States and Great Britain at Washington, February 20, 1892, to
                    determine the questions then pending between these two Governments, the
                    following decisions were adopted: <list>
                        <item>First. By the ukase of 1821 Russia claimed jurisdiction in the sea now
                            known as the Bering Sea to the extent of 100 Italian miles from the
                            coasts and islands belonging to <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0282"
                            />her, but in the course of the negotiations which led to the conclusion
                            of the treaties of 1824 with the United States and of 1825 with Great
                            Britain, Russia admitted that her jurisdiction in the said sea should be
                            restricted to the reach of cannon shot from, shore, and it now appears
                            that, from that time up to the time of the cession of Alaska to the
                            United States, Russia never asserted in fact or exercised any exclusive
                            jurisdiction in Bering Sea or any exclusive rights in the seal fisheries
                            therein beyond the “ordinary limit of territorial waters.</item>
                        <item>Second. The body of water now known as the Bering Sea was included in
                            the phrase “Pacific Ocean,” as used in the treaty of 1825 between Great
                            Britain and Russia.</item>
                        <item>Third. No exclusive rights of jurisdiction in Bering Sea and no
                            exclusive rights as to seal fisheries therein were held or exercised by
                            Russia outside of ordinary territorial waters after the treaty of
                            1825.</item>
                        <item>Fourth. The United States has not any right of protection in the fur
                            seals frequenting the islands of the United States in Bering Sea when
                            such seals are found outside the ordinary 3-mile limit.</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>It can hardly be questioned that these rulings are equally applicable to any
                    claim on the part of Russia to jurisdiction beyond ordinary territorial waters,
                    or to any right of Russia of protection of the fur seals in the Bering Sea or
                    North Pacific Ocean beyond ordinary jurisdictional limits.</p>
                <p>Indeed, Russia has herself disclaimed any jurisdiction in the Bering Sea outside
                    ordinary territorial waters, as is abundantly shown by all her acts, and by the
                    evidence of Exhibits L, M, N, and O hereto annexed in the evidence submitted in
                    this case.</p>
                <p>The Bering Sea is therefore the high sea, the common highway of all nations, and
                    no right of seizure thereon for alleged or suspected violation of the municipal
                    laws of any nation can be maintained, nor has any nation the right of visitation
                    and search thereon of vessels of friendly states in time of peace.</p>
                <p>It is admitted by the Russian Government that the <hi rend="italic">Kate and
                        Anna</hi> was more than 20 miles from Russian land when she was arrested.
                    She was therefore upon the high seas and wholly without Russian
                    jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>Chancellor Kent has stated: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The open sea is not capable of being possessed as private property, the
                            free use of the ocean for navigation and fishing is common to all
                            mankind, and the public jurists generally and explicitly deny that the
                            ocean can ever be appropriated.</p>

                <p>Vattel says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>To-day every expanse of the sea which is within cannon shot of the coast
                            is regarded as forming part of the territory, and for that reason a
                            vessel taken under the cannon of a neutral fortress is not good
                            prize.</p>
                        <p>All we have said of parts of the sea near the coasts may be more
                            particularly said, and with greater justice, of roadsteads, bay, and
                            straits as still more capable of being occupied, and more important to
                            the safety of the country. But I speak of bays and straits of small
                            extent, and not of the great expanses of the sea to which are sometimes
                            given the names such as Hudson Bay, the Straits of Magellan, over which
                            empire could not extend and still less ownership. (Le droit des Gens.,

                            of authority, and the practice of nations have decided that the main

                            from its nature incapable of being possessed, can not be the property of

                <p>The very eminent Russian jurist, Monsieur F. de Martens, counsel for the Imperial

                            freedom of the ocean, and no people can set up the pretension of
                            reigning over it as master. At <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0283"

                <p>Quoting further from the same treatise: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            engaging in fishing and other peaceful enterprises on the high seas. If

                            impose its laws over the others, cause judgment to be passed on foreign
                            navigators or sailors, nor arrest, nor search the ships of another

                            and as what has been said of complete ownership is equally applicable to
                            partial ownership—as, for example, the right of use, of gathering its
                            fruits, of taking its products—it is demonstrated that no nation can
                            have exclusively these partial rights of ownership; that the use of the
                            sea remains forever open and common to all; that it is, so to speak, the
                            patrimony of all mankind, a joint patrimony with regard to which the

                <p>The same author remarks: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>As to interior seas, a right of exclusive domain and sovereignty on the
                            part of a nation over such a sea is only incontestable when that sea is
                            totally included within the territory, so as to form an integral part of
                            it, and so that it can absolutely only serve as a means of communication
                            between the citizens of the nation in question alone. Then, indeed, none
                            of the conditions obstructive to ownership or to empire of the seas are
                            applicable. But the moment that several different States possess the
                            shores of such a sea, none of them can call itself the owner or
                            sovereign to the exclusion of the other. (Ibid., p. 159.).</p>

                    were for damages sustained by vessels which had been warned out of Bering Sea.
                    They are as follows: Claim No. 4, the <hi rend="italic">Favorite;</hi> No. 11,
                        <hi rend="italic">Triumph;</hi> No. 12, <hi rend="italic">Juanita;</hi> No.
                    14, <hi rend="italic">Triumph;</hi> No. 17, <hi rend="italic">Ariel;</hi> No.
                    18, <hi rend="italic">Kate</hi>. In all these cases the commissioners awarded
                    damages, not alone for seal skins confiscated, but for loss of catch.</p>
                <p>As to the property seized by the commander of the cruiser, there can be no
                    question of the indemnity due. The proposition of the Russian Government that
                    indemnity can be due only on proof that the seals from which the skins were
                    taken were caught outside Russian jurisdiction, is wholly untenable. Russia has
                    shown no invasion of <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0284"/>her territory by
                    this or any other vessel, nor any evidence in the smallest degree connecting the
                        <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> with any depredations, or even that any
                    depredation had been commited by anyone. The skins were taken by the <hi
                        rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> in the regular practice of her lawful
                    calling upon the open sea, and upon that open sea they were unwarrantably taken
                    from her by an armed cruiser of the Russian navy. That her owners should be
                    called upon to prove that they were not stolen from Russian waters before
                    restitution be made is a proposition unheard of in international relations. Were
                    such a precedent established no merchant ship would be secure upon the high seas
                    against the confiscation of her merchandise.</p>
                <p>The damages here claimed for loss of catch are in no sense indirect damages for
                    loss of speculative profits. They represent an actual loss sustained by the
                    owners, officers, and crew, and are of the nature of demurrage.</p>
                <p>The earnings of a fishing vessel depend upon her taking advantage of her
                    opportunity when it arrives, and the loss of her use, with that of her outfit
                    and crew, in the middle of the season, deprives her owners of any return upon
                    their investment, and her officers and crew of all remuneration for their
                    labor.</p>
                <p>The rule of damages is well settled that in a fishing voyage the loss of the
                    services of a fishing vessel is to be compensated upon the value of the vessel’s
                    use. The objection that prospective profits are not admissible as a substantive
                    ground of damage does not apply or exclude the use of the average catch of a
                    fishing vessel as evidence of the value of the vessel’s use, but is the best
                    evidence, exactly as it is the evidence used in other cases to determine the
                    injury suffered by a party from the deprivation of the use of his property.</p>
                <p>In the case of the <hi rend="italic">Costa Rica Packet</hi> the distinguished

                            master, or still less to sell her at a reduced price;</p>
                        <p>Whereas the owners or the captain of the ship being under an obligation,

                <p>Thus the arbitrator in this case clearly admitted the justice of the claim for
                    damages owing to the loss of the use of the vessel, found that certain

                    vessel so modified the degree of responsibility of the Dutch Government for the

                        <p>Both the questions of law presented by the record relate to the amount of

                <p>In the case of Williamson <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Barrett, before the Supreme
                    Court of the United States, Mr. Justice Nelson, in delivering the opinion of the
                    court, said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>As to the question of damages, the jury were instructed, if they found
                            for the plaintiffs, to give damages that would remunerate them for the
                            loss necessarily incurred in raising the boat and repairing her, and
                            also for the use of the boat during the time necessary to make the
                            repairs and fit her for business.</p>
                        <p>By the use of the boat, we understand what she would produce to the
                            plaintiffs by the hiring or chartering of her to run upon the river in
                            the business in which she had been usually engaged.</p>
                        <p>The general rule in regulating damages in cases of collisions is to allow
                            the injured party an indemnity to the extent of the loss sustained. This
                            rule is obvious enough; but there is a good deal of difficulty in
                            stating the grounds upon which to arrive, in all cases, at the proper
                            measure of that indemnity.</p>
                        <p>The expense of raising the boat and of repairs may, of course, be readily
                            ascertained, and in respect to repairs no deduction is to be made as in
                            insurance cases for the new materials in place of the old. The
                            difficulty lies in estimating the damage sustained by the loss of
                            service of the vessel while she is undergoing the repairs.</p>
                        <p>That an allowance short of some compensation for this loss would fail to
                            be an indemnity for the injury is apparent. This question was, directly
                            before the court of admiralty in England, in the case of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Gazelle</hi>, decided by Dr. Lushington in 1844 (2 W.
                            Robinson, 279). That was a case of collision, and in “deciding it the
                            court observed that the party who had suffered the injury is clearly
                            entitled to an adequate compensation for any loss he may sustain for the
                            detention of the vessel during the period which is necessary for the
                            completion of the repairs and furnishing the new articles.</p>
                        <p>In fixing the amount of the damages to be paid for the detention the
                            court allowed the gross freight, deducting so much as would in ordinary
                            cases be disbursed on account of the ship’s expenses in earning it.</p>
                        <p>This rule may afford a very fair indemnity in cases where the repairs are
                            completed within the period usually occupied in the voyage in which the
                            freight is to be earned. But, if a longer period is required, it
                            obviously falls short of an adequate allowance. It looks to the capacity
                            of the vessel to earn freight for the benefit of the owner, and
                            consequent loss while deprived of her service—in other words, to the
                            amount she would earn him on hire. (13 Howard, 101.)</p>

                <p>This subject has recently undergone the most thorough and careful examination by
                    the commission appointed to adjust the claims of the Canadian sealers against
                    the Government of the United States, commonly known as the Bering Sea claims. It
                    is scarcely necessary to do more than to refer to the arguments submitted before
                    this tribunal on behalf of the English Government and of the American Government
                    for the most complete and exhaustive review of all the decisions upon the
                    subject.</p>
                <p>The English Government contended for the rule as claimed in the present case. An
                    examination of the awards made in certain cases before the Bering Sea Commission
                    leaves no room for doubt that in those cases, at least, the commission adopted
                    the rule as contended for by the English Government, and as herein stated. In
                    the awards upon all of these claims it is perfectly clear that the loss of catch
                    was allowed in measuring the damages. If there were any doubt of this it is
                    relieved by such cases as No. 14, the <hi rend="italic">Triumph</hi>, where the
                    sole claim was for loss of catch. In the case of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Triumph</hi>, No. 14, not No. 11 for the same vessel, the award was
                    $15,500; the original claim was for $19,624, of which $250 was for legal and
                    other expenses, $19,424 being for balance of estimated catch of 2,500 skins at
                    $8 each. It was admitted that the <hi rend="italic">Triumph</hi> had transhipped
                    part of her season’s catch before entering Bering Sea, on or about July 4. A
                    considerable part of the season had therefore already elapsed, and it was
                    reasonable to suppose that she had taken a fifth part of her probable catch
                    before entering Bering Sea; thus 2,000 skins would remain to be taken to make up
                    the season’s work of 2,500 skins. She had on board 72 skins when taken, leaving
                    1,928 skins to be taken to make up the 2,000. One thousand nine hundred and
                    twenty-eight skins at $8 would amount to $15,424, and the award was for $15,450,
                    as has been said.</p>
                <p>The rule of allowing interest upon claims of this nature is so well established
                    as to need little comment in the present instance; indeed, it may be said to be

                            Charles Woge, citizens of the United States, his residence within the
                            United States for the last five years, and his residence within the

                        <p>Know ye that on the 18th day of October, in the year of our Lord one
                            thousand eight hundred and ninety-two, before me, the said notary, at my
                            office, in the city and county of San Francisco, personally appeared
                            Charles Lutjen, master of the schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and
                                Anna</hi>, belonging to the port of San Francisco (the said master
                            having previously noted, in due form of law, his intention to protest),
                            who, together with Daniel Clanssen, hunter and third mate, and Frank
                            Morean hunter and second mate, belonging to the aforesaid vessel, being
                            by me duly sworn on the holy evangelists of Almighty God, voluntarily
                            and solemnly did declare and depose as follows, to wit:</p>
                        <p>That they, the said appearers, on the 1st day of March, A. D. 1892, set
                            sail and departed in and with the said vessel from the port of San
                            Francisco, having on board a hunting and fishing outfit, aud bound for
                            the North Pacific Ocean, the said vessel being then stout, staunch, and
                            strong, her cargo well and sufficiently stowed and secure, well masted,
                            manned, tackled, victualled, appareled, and appointed, and in every
                            respect fit for sea and the voyage she was about to undertake; that we
                            proceeded on our voyage without disaster of any kind, and had been
                            hunting seals until the 12th day of August, A. D., 1892, at which time
                            we had on board 124 seal skins, which had all been taken in the North
                            Pacific Ocean more than 30 miles south of the Copper and Bering islands,
                            when on said 12th day of August, 1892, being then in said North Pacific
                            Ocean, on the high seas, in latitude 54° 9′ north, longitude 168° 21′
                            east, by correct observation, we were ordered by the Russian cruiser <hi
                                rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> to heave to, and the captain of our
                            vessel was ordered to come on board of said cruiser, and to bring his
                            papers with him.</p>
                        <p>I, the undersigned, captain of said <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>,
                            then went aboard of the said cruiser; the captain of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> told me that I could not prove by my log
                            book that I had not got the sealskins in Russian waters, and he then
                            took all my sealskins, 124 in number, confiscated them, and ordered me
                            to stop sealing and go home.</p>
                        <p>I then protested against the seizure of the sealskins, and the captain of
                            the cruiser then forced me to sign a paper in Russian, which I did not
                            understand. I signed said paper under protest.</p>
                        <p>Captain Deleveron, of said Russian cruiser, signed a statement in my log
                            book, of which the following is a copy:</p>
                        <p>“Schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> was arrested in 54° 9′
                            north latitude and 168° 21′ east longitude, though not in Russian waters
                            exactly, but she has been sealing at the sealing grounds of Commander
                            Islands. The contraverse could not be witnessed by the log book, so the
                            seals are confiscated; but the vessel was not taken, and got free.</p>
                        <p rend="right">“<hi rend="smallcaps">B. de Liveron</hi>,<lb/>”<hi
                                rend="italic">Captain of H. I. M. Russian Cruiser
                            ‘Zabiaca.’</hi></p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">August</hi> 12, 1892.”</p>
                        <p>I then, with my vessel and crew, sailed for the port of San Francisco, in
                            accordance with the orders of said captain of the said <hi rend="italic"
                                >Zabiaca</hi>, fearing that should I remain fishing in said North
                            Pacific Ocean I would be further molested by said cruiser, and arrived
                            in said port of San Francisco on the 23d day of September, A. D.
                            1892.</p>
                        <p>And the said appearers further declare that as all the damage and injury
                            which already has or may hereafter appear to have happened or accrued to
                            the said vessel, her freight and cargo, has been occasioned solely by
                            the circumstances hereinbefore stated, and can not, or ought not to, be
                            attributed to any insufficiency of the said vessel, the neglect or
                            default of him, this deponent, his officers or crew. He now requires me,
                            the said notary, to make his protest and this public act thereof, that
                            the same may serve and be of full force and value, as of right shall
                            appertain. And thereupon the said master protested, and I, the said
                            notary, at his special instance and request, did, as by these presents I
                            now do, publicly and solemnly protest against winds, weather, and seas,
                            and against all and every accident, matter, and thing had and met with
                            as aforesaid, whereby, or by means whereof, the said vessel, her
                            freight, or her cargo already has, or hereafter shall have, suffered or
                            sustained loss, damage, or injury, and for all losses, costs, charges,
                            expenses, damages, and injury <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0297"
                            />which the said vessel, or the owner or owners of the said vessel, or
                            the owners, freighters, or shippers of her said cargo, or any other
                            person or persons interested or concerned in either, already have been
                            or may hereafter be called upon to pay, sustain, incur, or be put unto
                            by or on account of the premises, or for which the insurer or insurers
                            of the said vessel, her freight, or her cargo, is or are respectively
                            liable to pay or make contributions or average, according to custom, on
                            their respective contracts or obligations, so that no part of any
                            losses, damages, injuries, or expenses already incurred, or hereafter to
                            be incurred, do fall on him, the said master, his officers or crew.</p>
                        <p>Thus done and protested in San Francisco, Cal., this 18th day of October,
                            in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety-two.</p>
                        <p>In testimony whereof, as well as the said appearers, as I, the notary,
                            have subscribed these presents, and I have also caused my seal of office
                            to be hereunto affixed the day and year before written.</p>

                        <p>The memorial of Claus Lutjens, commonly known and called by the name of
                            Charles Lutjens, to the Department of State of the United States,
                            respectfully shows:</p>
                        <p>That the said Claus Lutjens makes this claim and memorial in his own
                            right and for his own benefit;</p>
                        <p>That the above-named Claus Lutjens is now, and was at the time when the
                            claim hereinafter set forth had its origin, a duly naturalized citizen
                            of the United States, and presents herewith a duly certified copy of his
                            naturalization papers, and a duly qualified and registered voter in the
                            city and county of San Francisco, State of California;</p>
                        <p>The said Claus Lutjens claims from the Russian Government the sum of
                            $10,000, being the entire sum hereby claimed; the claimant believes that
                            the sum so claimed would not reimburse him for the losses sustained by
                            the wrongful act of the authorities of the Russian Government,
                            hereinafter set forth; and that this claimant has received no money or
                            other equivalent or indemnification from insurance or otherwise for the
                            whole or any part of the loss or injury upon which this claim is
                            founded.</p>
                        <p>That the said claim is based upon the following facts and circumstances,
                            to wit:</p>
                        <p>The said Claus Lutjens, in the pursuit of his regular and legitimate
                            business, was at all the times herein mentioned the owner of the
                            American schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>, which said
                            schooner was enrolled and registered in the port of San Francisco, and
                            said schooner was regularly cleared from said port for a fishing and
                            hunting voyage in the North Pacific Ocean, or elsewhere, as the master
                            might direct, having at the time on board said vessel a hunting and
                            fishing outfit, consisting of rifles, shotguns, powder, and hunting and
                            fishing gear, all of which will more fully and at large appear by the
                            certified copies of the original enrollment or registry of said schooner
                            and certified copies of the original clearance papers and outward
                            manifest of said schooner, which are herewith filed, and that the reason
                            why the originals of all of said papers were and are not filed is that
                            all of said original papers were and are in the United States
                            custom-house at San Francisco, Cal.</p>
                        <p>That said Claus Lutjens, owner of said American schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> as above set forth, was then, and
                            at all the times hereinafter mentioned, the duly acting and qualified
                            master of said schooner, and is now and was at the time when the claim
                            herein set forth had its origin a citizen of the United States of
                            America and of the State of California; that the said schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> on the 1st day of March, A. D.
                            1892, under command of the said master, and with a good and sufficient
                            crew and a hunting and fishing outfit on board, as aforesaid, did set
                            sail and depart from the said port of San Francisco, bound for the North
                            Pacific Ocean, said vessel being <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0298"
                            />at that time and at all the times hereinafter mentioned seaworthy and
                            in all respects fit for the voyage which it took as herein mentioned;
                            that the master and crew proceeded with said vessel on their voyage
                            without disaster of any kind until the 12th day of August, A. D. 1892,
                            and that prior to said day and in the open Pacific Ocean, more than 30
                            miles south of the Commander Islands, and not in Russian waters, had
                            killed and taken 124 seals, worth in the open market $1,767, all of
                            which were caught and killed on the voyage from San Francisco, and more
                            than 30 miles south of the Commander Islands, and not in Russian waters;
                            and that on said 12th day of August arrived at 54° 9′ north, longitude
                            168° 21′ east, by correct observation, and had not sealed in said place,
                            nor at any place within 30 miles south of said Commander Islands or in
                            Russian waters at all, and no boats being out at said time from said
                            vessel, either for hunting or fishing, and no one from said vessel being
                            either hunting or fishing, and said schooner then sailing in a
                            southwesterly course.</p>
                        <p>Said latitude 54° 9′ north, longitude 168° 21′ east, by correct
                            observation is more than 30 miles from Copper or Bering Islands on the
                            high seas, and not in Russian waters; when, at said time, and in the
                            latitude and longitude above mentioned, on the 12th day of August, A. D,
                            1892, as aforesaid, and not being at the time hunting or fishing, and
                            not having at any time fished or hunted seals in Russian waters, but
                            being at said time on a southwesterly course, as aforesaid, the Russian
                            war cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> was at all times herein
                            mentioned a steamer regularly commissioned as a war cruiser, and
                            belonging to the Russian Government, armed for offensive and defensive
                            warfare, and acting under the authority and by the directions of the
                            said Russian Government, steamed toward said schooner and fired a blank
                            charge, which was an order for said schooner to heave-to. I accordingly
                            heaved-to, and said cruiser steamed alongside said schooner, and I was
                            ordered to come on board the cruiser with the schooner’s papers; I
                            accordingly went on board with my papers, showed my log book and other
                            papers to the captain of said cruiser, who then ordered me to send my
                            sealskins to said cruiser, to stop sealing, and to go home. I then,
                            under said orders, and being forced to do so by said cruiser, sent on
                            board said cruiser 124 sealskins; and being then fearful of arrest and
                            confiscation of my schooner by said cruiser, I stopped sealing and
                            sailed for San Francisco, at which port I arrived on the 23d day of
                            September, A. D. 1893.</p>
                        <p>While on board said cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> the captain
                            thereof wrote in my log book the following, to wit:</p>
                        <p>“Schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> was arrested in 54° 9′
                            north latitude and 168° 21′ longitude, though not in Russian waters
                            exactly, but she has been sealing at the sealing grounds of Commander
                            Islands. The con traverse could not be witnessed by the log book, so the
                            seals are confiscated, but the vessel was not taken, and got free.</p>
                        <p rend="right">“<hi rend="smallcaps">B. de Livron</hi>,<lb/>”<hi

                        <p>My original log book, containing said writing by said Russian captain, is
                            now in my possession, and will be produced by me in support hereof when
                            required.</p>
                        <p>By said wrongful seizure by the Russian cruiser <hi rend="italic"
                                >Zabiaca</hi>, as aforesaid, I have been damaged as follows, to wit:
                            In the sum of $1,767, United States gold coin, by the seizure of the 124
                            seal skins above set forth, and in the sum of $8,233, United States gold
                            coin, by the breaking up of my voyage from the threats and wrongful
                            armed interference of said Russian war cruiser <hi rend="italic"
                                >Zabiaca.</hi></p>
                        <p>That I, as master of said schooner, <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>,
                            duly protested at the time to the captain of said Russian war cruiser
                            against the seizure of said seal skins, and against all the other acts
                            herein complained of; that on the 18th day of October, A. D. 1892, I
                            duly noted a protest against said seizure and said acts with Harry J.
                            Lask, a notary public in and for the city and county of San Francisco,
                            State of California; and on said day, before said notary public, I duly
                            made a regular marine protest.</p>
                        <p>That the seizure of said seal skins and all of said acts by the said war
                            cruiser, by the officers thereof, and by the Russian officials, were in
                            violation of the law of nations and of the right of citizens of the
                            United States, and in contravention to the treaties existing between the
                            United States of America and Russia, and that this claim is founded upon
                            the principles of international law and the rights which every nation
                            and every person has upon the high seas, and upon the fact that all the
                            above mentioned acts by the Russian Government and its officials were in
                            violation thereof.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore I hereby request the interposition of the Government of the
                            United States of America against the Russian Government for the
                            presentation of this claim against said Russian Government.</p>

                        <p>It appears that this vessel cleared from San Francisco March 1, 1892,
                            bound for a hunting and fishing voyage to the North Pacific Ocean. That
                            between the 1st day of March, 1894, and the 12th day of the same month,
                            the captain and crew caught and killed, on the voyage and on the high
                            seas, and not in Russian waters, 124 seals, worth $1,767, and that on
                            the 12th of March, 1892, when in latitude 54° 9′ north, longitude 168°
                            21′ east, on a southwesterly course, more than 30 miles from Copper or
                            Bering Islands, on the high seas and not engaged in fishing or hunting
                            in Russian waters, this vessel was stopped by the Russian war cruiser
                                <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>. The captain was forced to go on
                            board the cruiser, his seal skins were taken from him, and he was
                            ordered to take his vessel back to San Francisco.</p>
                        <p>For this loss and interruption the claim of $10,000 is presented to the
                            Imperial Government, and attention is called to a copy of the memorial

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Envoy</hi>: I did not fail to report to the
                            competent quarter the contents of your note of November 9/21, 1894,
                            relative to the affair of the confiscation by the Russian war cruiser
                                <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> in the month of August, 1892, of 124
                            seal skins on the American schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and
                                Anna.</hi></p>
                        <p>According to a communication which I have just received from the imperial
                            ministry of marine the commander of the <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>
                            believed himself to be justified in making this confiscation, inasmuch
                            as, having encountered the schooner at a distance of 30 miles to the
                            south of the Commander Islands, it was shown that the log book had not
                            been kept up for ten days, and that the chart of the voyage bore marks
                            which indicated that during these ten days she had twice been in the
                            channel between Bering and Medny islands.</p>
                        <p>He concluded that the seals had been killed in Russian waters, and, in
                            confiscating the skins in question, finding no other supporting
                            evidence, he released the schooner, but required of the captain an
                            engagement, signed by him, not to kill seals in Russian waters. Mention
                            was made of this engagement in the log book. According to the statement
                            of the commander of the <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> no claim was made
                            at the time by the captain of the schooner.</p>
                        <p>In view of the above-stated facts and the good faith of the commander of
                            the <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi> being beyond doubt, it is clear that
                            indemnity to the captain of the schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and
                                Anna</hi> could only be due for the 124 seal skins confiscated upon
                            his proving that the seals in question were killed outside the limits of
                            Russian waters.</p>
                        <p>As to the claim of $8,233 for loss sustained, owing to the measures taken
                            by the commander of the <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>, that can not be
                            taken into consideration, inasmuch as the <hi rend="italic">Kate and
                                Anna</hi> was not prevented from continuing her hunting outside the
                            prohibited waters.</p>

                            sworn, says:</p>
                        <p>My full name is Charles Lutjens, sometimes also called Claus Lutjens; my
                            age is 59 years; my place of birth is North Germany; I am a citizen of
                            the United States; my residence is Alameda, Cal.; my occupation, master
                            mariner; my residence at the time the events took place in relation to
                            which my testimony is given was San Francisco; my occupation at that
                            time was master mariner. I am the claimant above named, and am, and was
                            at the date of the seizure of the said schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate
                                and Anna</hi>, the owner thereof. I produce herewith the log book or
                            original book of entry of said schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and
                                Anna</hi>, which is marked “Exhibit A,” and duly certified by the
                            notary. The said log book is in the handwriting of Jim Crew, mate of
                            said schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>, who is now deceased.
                            I know the handwriting of said Jim Crew. I have seen him write many
                            times, and know his handwriting well, and on the voyage I frequently saw
                            him make entries in said log book, and the facts in relation to this log
                            book are exclusively within my knowledge since the death of said mate,
                            Jim Crew. I was on said schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>
                            acting as captain and master thereof during the voyage of said schooner,
                            commencing March 2, 1892, at <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0302"
                            />which time we left the port of San Francisco, and up to the time of
                            the return of said schooner to the said port of San Francisco, and
                            particularly at the date of the seizure of said seal skins by the
                            Russian war cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>, August 12, 1892. No
                            entries were made in said log book subsequent to said seizure. The
                            entries in said log book were each made at the date that they severally
                            purport to have been made by said mate, Jim Crew, under my directions,
                            and each of said entries in said log book is true of my own knowledge;
                            and the statement contained in said log book purporting to be signed by
                            B. de Livrein, captain, and reading as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> was arrested in 54° 9’ N.
                            lat. and 168° 2’ long., though not in Russian waters exactly; but she
                            has been sealing at the sealing grounds of Commodore Islands. The contra
                            verse could not be witnessed by the log book, so the seals are
                            confiscated; but the vessel was not taken, and got free.</p>

                            by him in my presence in the cabin of the said Russsan cruiser <hi
                                rend="italic">Zabiaca.</hi></p>
                        <p>As will appear by said log book, during said voyage we had caught 1,376
                            seals, 124 of which were seized by said Russian cruiser <hi
                                rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>, and the other 1,252 seal skins had been,
                            previous to said seizure, by me discharged at Hakodate, Japan, and
                            shipped to London, England, and there sold in open market for the sum of
                            $14 each, net. I estimate that had it not been for the seizure of said
                            skins and the orders of the captain of said Russian cruiser <hi
                                rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>, ordering me to cease sealing, as is more
                            fully set forth in my memorial on file herein, that up to September 15,
                            1892, during which time the sealing season would have lasted, and which
                            would have been the best month for sealing, the probable catch of said
                            schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> would have been at least
                            625 seal skins in addition to those seized, which would have netted the
                            same price as the other seal skins sold by me as aforesaid, to wit, $14
                            each, or the sum of $8,750, and that I was then and am damaged to the
                            amount of $8,750 by the breaking up of my voyage by the Russian cruiser
                                <hi rend="italic">Zabiaca</hi>, in addition to the value of the
                            skins seized as set forth in my memorial herein. I further state that
                            the schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> carried 4 hunting
                            boats and a full equipment of hunters and sealers to man said boats.</p>

                            says:</p>
                        <p>My age is 38 years; I was born at San Francisco, Cal. My residence is
                            now, and was at the time the events took place in regard to which I am
                            testifying and deposing, at San Francisco, Cal. My occupation is now
                            butcher; my occupation at the time the events took place in regard to
                            which I am testifying and deposing was butcher; but I was then, and
                            prior thereto, and subsequently thereafter, managing owner and part
                            owner of sealing vessels and otherwise interested in the sealing
                            business. I am not interested directly or indirectly in the said claim,
                            nor have I any contingent interest in the same. I am not the agent or
                            attorney of the claimant making the above claim nor of any person
                            whatever interested therein. I will not be entitled to receive any part
                            of any sum which may be awarded under said claim to said claimant. I
                            have been engaged in the sealing business as aforesaid since 1884, and
                            am now interested in said business, and during that time I have been
                            managing owner and part owner of the following-named vessels engaged in
                            the sealing business, viz, <hi rend="italic">City of San Diego,
                                Vanderbilt, C. G. Wilson, Ellen, Bowhead</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                                >Active</hi>. I know the probable number of seals which a
                            well-equipped sealing vessel would have captured in 1892. I know the
                            schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> well, and knew said
                            schooner in 1892. I knew Charles Lutgens was in every way well
                            acquainted with the sealing business and fully competent for the
                            purpose, and that the <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> was well
                            equipped for the sealing business, and that the crew and hunters were
                            skilled in said sealing business; and I know that during the years from
                            1890 to 1896, while the said Charles Lutgens was acting as master of
                            said schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>, the said vessel
                            under his management captured fully as many seals in proportion to its
                            size and equipment as any other vessel clearing from the port of San
                            Francisco. I know that in the season of 1892 seals were plentiful from
                            August 12, 1892, to the end of the season of 1892, and I know that
                            during that season seal skins were worth in London as high as $14 each.
                            I firmly believe and do depose and say that during the remainder of the
                            sealing season of 1892, after August 12, 1892, the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Kate and Anna</hi> would be reasonably expected to capture and
                            catch at least 625 seals, and that the value of the seal skins so caught
                            would have been $8,750; and I place the probable catch of seals by the
                                <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> for the remainder of the season
                            of 1892, after August 12, 1892, at 625, and the probable value thereof
                            at $8,750.</p>

                <p>The Imperial Russian Government, having taken cognizance of the data contained in
                    the memorandum presented by the United States Government to the honorable
                    arbitrator, Mr. Asser, has the honor to formulate the following observations
                    relative to the four cases in question: <list>
                        <item>First case, <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon.</hi></item>
                        <item>Second case, <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis.</hi></item>

                    </list></p>
                <p>The defendant party recognizes the party claimant’s demands for indemnity for
                    material losses as justified to a certain extent in the Cases I and IV, but
                    rejects from the very foundation the claims which relate to Cases II and
                    III.</p>
                <p>As to the question of interest upon the total amount of indemnity which may be
                    due, the defendant party does not consider that it has the right to raise
                    objections, and, in accordance with the customs obtaining in its country, is
                    ready to consent to a tax of 6 per cent per annum.</p>
                <p>Before proceeding to examine in detail the four cases under discussion, the
                    defendant party believes it its duty to state the conditions under which these
                    cases occurred.</p>
                <p>The question of the protection of seals from destruction, with which they were
                    threatened by marauding vessels, whether on the high seas or in territorial
                    waters, has been for some time a matter of particular solicitude to the
                    Governments of Russia and of the United States of America as the possessors, in
                    the islands of Commander, Pribilof, and Tuleny, of the only landing places at
                    present known of these precious animals.</p>
                <p>To this end the Cabinet of Washington was obliged, long before the occurrence of
                    the four cases in question, to treat with the Government of Great Britain
                    because of the fact that seal fishing was specially carried on by Canadians.</p>
                <p>The negotiations which took place upon this subject in 1887, in which the Russian
                    Government also took part, did not bring about the desired result.</p>
                <p>However, in 1890 the conferences were renewed between England and the United
                    States of America, the latter power demanding that her jurisdiction be
                    recognized far beyond territorial waters, which demand was not admitted by the
                    London Cabinet. An agreement between the two Governments was concluded on the
                    15th of June, 1891. It was entitled “Agreement for a modus vivendi between the
                    United States and Great Britain in relation to the fur-seal fisheries in Bering
                    Sea.”</p>
                <p>By virtue of this agreement the two contracting parties engaged to interdict
                    their subjects reciprocally, and as much as possible to prevent <pb n="286"
                        xml:id="pg_286" facs="0308"/>them from killing seals during one year—that is
                    to say, until the end of May, 1892—either in that part of the Bering Sea
                    situated to the east of the line of demarcation established by the treaty of
                    1867 between Russia and the United States or on the Pribilof Islands, with the
                    exception that 750 seals might be killed to supply the needs of the Aleutian
                    population of these islands. Persons and vessels guilty of infringement of this
                    interdiction were liable to seizure.</p>
                <p>In concluding this agreement the object of the two powers was to pave the way for
                    future negotiations as well as to be able to procure on the spot necessary data
                    upon the subject of the conditions under which this industry was or might be
                    carried on. This data would serve as material for the solution of differences
                    arising between the two countries, which would have to be submitted to
                    arbitration, as article 4 of the agreement also provided for.</p>
                <p>The necessity for exceptional measures on this subject was so well recognized at
                    this time by the interested Governments that the London Cabinet, through the
                    medium of its representative at St. Petersburg, requested the Imperial
                    Government to interdict Russian subjects during the existence of the
                    Anglo-American agreement from sealing beyond the limits of the line of
                    demarcation fixed by this agreement, and even to authorize the English naval
                    authorities to seize vessels under the Russian flag which might infringe upon
                    this interdiction.</p>
                <p>This proposition was not accepted by the Imperial Government, which for its part
                    did not fail to take measures for the protection of seals in the western part of
                    Bering Sea, and accentuated this determination by sending a Russian man-of-war
                    to those parts.</p>
                <p>Meantime in the proximity of the Russian coasts there began an influx of foreign
                    vessels engaged in poaching, and it was therefore that in 1892 a cruiser of the
                    Imperial navy, furnished with instructions ad hoc, was sent to protect the
                    Russian interests engaged in the preservation of the seal herds. From subsequent
                    data it appears that, according to the estimates of the Russian concessionary
                    company as to the sealing rights in these parts, there were killed in 1891 by
                    poaching vessels 60,000 seals, of which 10,000 were within the limits of Russian
                    territorial waters. American and English vessels had participated equally in
                    this poaching.</p>
                <p>As for the measures taken by the American Government on its part during the
                    preceding years against vessels engaged in poaching in waters which it
                    considered under its jurisdiction, it will suffice to refer, among others, to
                    the Annex C of the award of the Paris tribunal of arbitration of the 29th of
                    February, 1892, and in which are mentioned a certain number of seizures made by
                    American cruisers, certain of which took place at considerable distance from the
                    coast, even up to 115 miles.</p>
                <p>In presenting the above explanations, to which may be added the facts developed
                    further on in each particular case, the defendant party looks to the high equity
                    of the arbitrator to decide these cases, which occurred, as a matter of fact, in
                    a locality over which the claimant demands the right of jurisdiction far beyond
                    the waters surrounding her own coasts. Under these conditions the defendant
                    party, who had at that time taken such measures as it deemed necessary, was
                    justified in all good faith in believing that the present claimant could not
                    contest the legitimacy of actions having for their object the protection of
                    interests then considered as common.</p>

                            circumstances:</p>
                        <p>On the 29th of August (10th September), 1892, at 3 a.m., in 46° 33’
                            latitude north, and 146° 30’ longitude east, from aboard the schooner
                                <hi rend="italic">Maria</hi>, seized by the Russian man-of-war <hi
                                rend="italic">Vitiaz</hi> for illegal seal fishing, and sailing
                            under command of Lieutenant von Cube, was sighted the whaling bark <hi
                                rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> lying to, and which, at the
                            approach of the schooner, hoisted red and white lights. Lieutenant von
                            Cube knew that in the western waters of the Pacific Ocean there were
                            vessels which remain at certain distance from the seal fisheries during
                            the season, and fill the roll of store ships, receiving the cargoes of
                            schooners which engage in that industry and which they furnish with
                            provisions. From the appearance and the conduct of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, the commander of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Maria</hi> took her for one of these vessels. On questioning
                            Captain Scullun, Lieutenant von Cube learned that the lights hoisted
                            were a signal agreed upon for the American schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >Mary H. Thomas</hi>, which was engaged in whaling and sealing, and
                            that Captain Scullun himself had been emphatically refused permission by
                            the Russian authorities to engage in whale fishing in the bays of the
                            Sea of Okhotsk. He moreover ascertained other details concerning the
                            relations of said bark with the sealing vessels off the Tuleny Island.
                            He found upon the bark the remains of two whales killed, and he was
                            satisfied by the points indicated upon the navigation chart that the <hi
                                rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> had entered the gulfs of Aniva
                            and Patience, lingering during the hunt principally in the proximity of
                            the Russian coast.</p>
                        <p>By reason of this data the Russian commander suspected the American
                            vessel of being engaged in an illegal industry, but finding it
                            impossible to search the vessel and thus confirm the fact upon the spot,
                            he decided to conduct the bark to Vladivostok; to this end he
                            transferred to said bark his own small crew of 12 men, and took with him
                            Captain Scullun. The bark’s crew, composed of about 30 men, he ordered
                            to repair to Vladivostok also, aboard the schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >Maria</hi>. (See detailed account of the incident, Exhibits Nos. I
                            and II.) When the two vessels arrived at the port of Vladivostok a
                            special commission was immediately appointed by an order of the
                            commander of the Pacific squadron, which, having inspected the bark <hi
                                rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, examined the log book and other
                            documents relating to the case, acknowledged the measures taken by
                            Lieutenant von Cube to be entirely regular. It was shown among other
                            things that the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> had been in
                            communication at sea with the schooner <hi rend="italic">Mary H.
                                Thomas</hi> and had begun the chase of the first whale at a point 5
                            miles off the island of Askold; but in the absence of duly established
                            proofs of <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0310"/>incriminating facts,
                            the commission did not find sufficient motives for the confiscation of
                            the detained vessel (Exhibit III). In consequence of this finding by the
                            above-mentioned commission, and in virtue of a decision by superior
                            authority, the American bark was released and restored to Captain
                            Scullun on the 15th of September, 1892 (Exhibit IV).</p>
                        <p>From the preceding it appears that Lieutenant von Cube, having in view
                            the governmental instructions to protect the seals from the operations
                            of poaching vessels in that region, and having strong presumptions
                            against a vessel apparently suspicious, had no alternative but the
                            fulfillment of the duty imposed upon him to subject the American bark to
                            a preventive detention pending an exhaustive examination of the matter
                            at the nearest port. Nevertheless, admitting that in the present case a
                            regrettable error has been made, and that in connection with a friendly
                            power the Russian Government recognized its responsibility to grant an
                            equitable pecuniary indemnification for the material losses caused to
                            these alien subjects by acts of agents of the Government, as has been
                            declared on several occasions to the American Government. (See annexes
                            to Memorandum of the United States, Exhibit I, etc.) The principle of
                            international right regarding the liberty of the high seas advanced by
                            the party claimant has no claim to consideration here, and the question
                            is limited solely as to the extent of indemnity which remains to be
                            assigned to the injured parties for the temporary arrest of the bark <hi
                                rend="italic">Cape HornPigeon.</hi></p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">amount of indemnity.</hi></p>
                        <p>Passing to the question of the amount of indemnity, the defendant party
                            finds it necessary to observe here that in the first place the chief
                            grounds for examination as to the justice of the claims presented by the
                            interested parties should be that furnishing the total of loss
                            sustained, which was presented by Captain Scullun on the 15th of
                            September, 1892, and which was sustained by the United States legation
                            (American Memorandum, Exhibits P, Pa, etc.). The amount of indemnity
                            claimed was then established under the still existing impression of
                            facts just as they occurred, and thus merits more consideration than the
                            claim advanced about eight years after the events had transpired.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the details of the claim, the defendant party deems it proper
                            to submit the following:</p>
                        <p>1. The chief point is manifestly the one which relates to the claim for
                            indemnity for the loss of profit which the whaler might have realized
                            from the catch—that is to say, from the taking of five or six whales
                            valued at $45,000. It does not appear to be reasonable to enter at this
                            time into the quesion of these hypothetical estimates as to the possible
                            number of whales killed at certain periods of the year, and of the
                            possible profits which might have been realized by the bark’s crew from
                            certain accessory products of the catch of these animals eight years
                            previous. Moreover, only the depositions of persons interested, or the
                            testimony of persons known to them and obtained outside of judicial
                            course, are admitted as proofs in the matter. The defendant party could
                            not recognize that there is any just basis for the claims on this point.
                            Although, according to the generally accepted views of civil rights, the
                            indemnification for injury done to the property of others relates not
                            only to the material damage (damnum emergens), <pb n="289"
                                xml:id="pg_289" facs="0311"/>but also to the loss of profit (lucrum
                            cessans); the latter must be understood in the sense of deprivation of a
                            fixed revenue or of a certain profit to be derived from holdings in
                            question (for example, such as the appropriation of another’s goods, or
                            of the damage occasioned to a vessel laden and on the point of
                            departure). In the present case it is a question of the profit of an
                            enterprise liable to risks, which may at any moment terminate in the
                            loss to those who participate in said enterprise. It would be impossible
                            to place an exact valuation several weeks previous upon that, whereon
                            the result depends upon a fortuitous success; when starting upon a hunt
                            exposed to dangers, one could not estimate in advance the product of
                            said hunt; one could not affirm that another might not have the benefit
                            of these very same whales which the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                                Pigeon</hi> alone hoped to capture. As to the statistical deductions
                            advanced, and which extend over a long period, they do not seem adapted
                            to a civil proceeding relating to a precise fact as in the present
                            case.</p>
                        <p>Nor do the arguments of the party claimant seem justified, either by the
                            precedents cited and which relate to cases arising under other
                            conditions. To the present case might better be likened the decision of
                            the arbitration tribunal of 1872 in the Alabama claims, decision upon
                            which was established the general principle that claims for
                            indemnification for indirect damages can not be allowed. This
                            incontestable principle of jurisprudence was practically applied in 1895
                            in a similar case, that is to say, in the case of a claim brought
                            against the Russian Government by the British Government for the seizure
                            of the Canadian schooners <hi rend="italic">Willie Mac Gowars</hi> and
                                <hi rend="italic">Ariel</hi>. The Russian Government in declaring a
                            willingness to indemnify the actual loss caused by the seizure of the
                            American bark <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> rejected all
                            responsibility for hypothetical losses occasioned by the vessel’s
                            temporary cessation from whale fishing (note of minister of foreign
                            affairs of Russia, June 12, 1893, Exhibit I). For the above-mentioned
                            reasons the demands of the party claimant looking to obtaining
                            indemnification of $45,000 for loss of catch should not be granted.</p>
                        <p>Still less justified seems the demand for indemnity of $31,000 for
                            enforced service of 31 men of crew of <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                                Pigeon</hi> aboard the schooner <hi rend="italic">Maria</hi>, and
                            for the bad treatment to which they were subjected on shore by the
                            authorities of Vladivostok. In the first place, it must be stated that
                            therein is a repetition of claim for indemnity by the same crew for
                            service rendered in conducting the schooner <hi rend="italic">Maria</hi>
                            to Vladivostok ($1,000 to $1,200), a claim which was originally filed by
                            the interested parties in 1892. But the chief objection is that all of
                            the allegations on the subject of acts of violence and cruelty committed
                            against these aliens rest solely in complaints made by the parties
                            concerned without the requisite proofs. The Russian Government protests
                            energetically against these allegations, and refers in this particular
                            to the view taken by the representative of the United States himself.
                            (Memorandum, Exhibit K.) Suffice it to recall that when the two vessels
                            met at sea the American crew was twice and one-half as numerous as that
                            of the Russian vessel; that Captain Scullun refused the lodging offered
                            him in the town, presenting a bill for the entertainment of his men on
                            shore, and that advice of the incident of the <hi rend="italic">Cape
                                Horn Pigeon</hi> was at once sent to St. Petersburg. Moreover, as
                            appears from the list joined to the memorandum (Exhibit C) among the
                            crew of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, there were, besides
                            the American <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0312"/>citizens,
                            Spaniards, Portuguese, English, Danes, Dutch, Swedes, and Germans, in
                            defense of whose rights their respective Governments should intervene.
                            However that may be, such claims would require positive proofs, which in
                            the present case are absolutely lacking.</p>
                        <p>Relative to the two points above mentioned it may be remarked that they
                            represent the greater part of the indemnity claimed, and that still more
                            than $40,000 interest for the nine years must be added. It would also be
                            well to examine that claim with particular care, without relieving the
                            party claimant from the onus probandi required upon all the points.</p>
                        <p>3. As to the claim for indemnification of the bark <hi rend="italic">Cape
                                Horn Pigeon</hi> for conducting the schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >Maria</hi> to Vladivostok, it is admitted as just to the amount of
                            $1,000 conformedly with a declaration made at the time by Captain
                            Scullun, but not to the amount to-day unduly augmented to the sum of
                            $1,200.</p>
                        <p>4. Neither does the defendant party contest the party claimant’s demand
                            of $200 for living expenses; $210 for lodgings, and $50 for the personal
                            expenses of the captain.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the total amount for general expenses of the shipowners,
                            estimated at $3,040, the defendant party maintains the opinion already
                            expressed, viz, that the claimants should be content to receive, as
                            general surplus, a sum of $1,040, since they have not presented vouchers
                            covering this point (telegrams, correspondence, etc.), and that at
                            present they refer still to expenses for the future conducting of the
                            case; that is to say, they recognize themselves that their estimates
                            were not entirely accurate.</p>
                        <p>5. Finally, the addition of legal interest, as has already been shown in
                            the counter-memorandum, is recognized as perfectly regular from the
                            moment when the party claimant may exact the payment of the principal
                            that may be due.</p>
                        <p>There remains still one observation to be made. Although the party
                            claimant has reserved liberty of future action, still in proposing
                            lately to close the affair by a payment of $42,000, without interest
                            (instead of $124,278 at present claimed), he manifestly expressed a
                            doubt as to the convincing character and the accuracy of the estimates
                            presented by him (note of 17th January (2d February) 1899, Memorandum,
                            Exhibit T).</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">conclusion.</hi></p>
                        <p>Conformably with the preceding, the defendant party acknowledges its
                            obligation to pay by way of indemnity the sum of $2,500 ($100, $200,
                            $210, $50, $1,040) with interest at 6 per cent from the 15th (27)
                            September, 1892, and requests that the other claims be rejected.</p>

                            <p>On the 29th of August (September 10), 1892, at 3 a.m., in 46° 33’
                                latitude north and 146° 30’ longitude east, on board the schooner
                                    <hi rend="italic">Maria</hi>, under command of Lieutenant von
                                Cube, a bark was sighted, lying to, which, upon the approach of the
                                schooner, hoisted a white light and under this a red light. An
                                officer was at once sent from the schooner in a ship’s boat to
                                request the captain of the bark to report aboard the schooner with
                                his sailing papers. When the captain, Thomas Scullun, had been
                                questioned and his papers examined, it was found that the American
                                bark <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> was engaged in whaling
                                in the Sea of Okhotsk, and moreover, from the points indicated on
                                the chart, it was evident that she had entered the Gulf of Aniva and
                                of Patience, and that her general course was in a direction to the
                                southeast of the island of Tuleny. The captain of the bark declared
                                that he had mistaken the Russian schooner for the American schooner
                                    <hi rend="italic">Mary H. Thomas</hi>, which was engaged in
                                whaling and sealing, that he was waiting to communicate with her,
                                and to this end had hoisted the signal agreed upon. It was announced
                                to the captain of the bark that he would be conducted with said bark
                                to Vladivostok for investigation into the question of his right to
                                engage in such industry and to sojourn in our waters.</p>
                            <p>The crew of the American bark was transferred to the schooner, and
                                the crew of the Russian schooner to the bark; Captain Scullun, with
                                his servant and steward, were left aboard the bark. At 10 o’clock in
                                the morning the two vessels weighed anchor and repaired to
                                Vladivostok.</p>

                                    >Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, declare that I agree with the statement

                                        years ago to get water, and not this season, and during my

                                    <item>Second. I was told by the officer who seized the bark that
                                        I was taken for whaling in the Okhotsk Sea, and that he
                                        would not have taken me if I had not had whales on
                                        board.</item>

                                    of the Schooner Maria to the Commander of the Pacific
                                    Squadron.</hi></p>
                            <p>In conformity with the orders received from your excellency I took
                                command of the schooner <hi rend="italic">Maria</hi> on the 20th of
                                August. This command was transmitted to me by the chief of district
                                of the Commander Islands, and I began at once to put the schooner in
                                order. I had all of the quarters scrubbed with the brush, as also
                                the upper deck. I took on a supply of drinking water and dissipated
                                the bad odor by frequently introducing water by means of the pumps.
                                I took on provisions for the crew sufficient to last two months, and
                                on the 24th of August I was ready to sail.</p>
                            <p>On the 24th of August at 8 p.m. I left by the outer road from
                                Petropavlovsk. On the 25th of August at 9 a.m. the first-class
                                cruiser <hi rend="italic">Vitiaz</hi> weighed anchor, tendered me a
                                cable, and at 10 o’clock, towed by the cruiser, I directed my course
                                toward the outlet of the bay of Avatchinsk. Leaving the bay, I
                                sailed in a direction parallel with the shore at a speed of from 6
                                to 8½ knots. From time to time when the wind permitted I augmented
                                sail. During the night of August 26 the west wind became strong, the
                                schooner was much shaken by the rolling and tossing of the sea, and
                                was taking in water.</p>
                            <p>On August 26 toward 3 p.m. we entered the third strait. At about 6
                                p.m. the fog had somewhat lifted, I could take my bearings. At 10
                                p.m., leaving the fifth strait, still towed by the cruiser, I
                                directed my course westward. I followed this direction until August
                                27 at 1.30 p.m., when the tow cable tendered by the cruiser broke.
                                    <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0314"/>Having received by
                                signal the order to proceed to my destination, I spread sail and
                                took the southwesterly direction. During the first three hours I
                                maintained a speed of 9 knots, but at 6 o’clock in the evening the
                                wind became so strong that it was necessary to reef sails, after
                                which the speed diminished to no more than 6 knots. I continued in
                                same direction until the 28th of August at 4 p.m., when I verified
                                my position at 47° 10′ latitute north and 147° 24′ longitude east.
                                The wind was still from ENE. After this verification I continued the
                                same course. The wind abated gradually, and at midnight passed from
                                S/2 to WSW.</p>
                            <p>At 3 a.m., I sighted at two points to starboard a vessel which I was
                                not able to clearly distinguish on account of the fog. This vessel
                                at my approach hoisted a white light above a red light, which was
                                evidently a signal agreed upon. Approaching to a distance of less
                                than a cable throw, and having ascertained that it was a whaling
                                vessel, I dropped anchor, lowered a boat, in it placed armed
                                oarsmen, and I sent Ensign Simansky to learn its mission, and to
                                request the captain to report to me with his documents and charts.
                                Capt. Thomas Scullun having boarded the cruiser declared that the
                                said bark bears the name of <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>,
                                and is engaged in the industry of whaling in the sea of Okhotsk;
                                that he had killed two whales this year, of which the oil and bone
                                could be found on the bark. To the question put by me as to the
                                meaning of the two lights hoisted upon the bark, he answered they
                                were a signal agreed upon, addressed to the schooner <hi
                                    rend="italic">Mary H. Thomas</hi>, for which he had mistaken my
                                vessel. The schooner <hi rend="italic">Mary H. Thomas</hi> is
                                engaged in whaling and sealing.</p>
                            <p>Having examined the navigation chart of the bark, I was convinced
                                that she had followed a direction principally to the south of the
                                island of Tuleny, but that she had been off the east coast and the
                                northwest coast of that island at a distance of 10 miles. Taking
                                into consideration the facts that the Tuleny Island is almost in a
                                state of siege, the relation between the bark and a schooner engaged
                                in sealing, and her continued presence at points not far from the
                                said island, I concluded that this bark, besides it special calling,
                                had some sort of bearing upon the seal fisheries in the vicinity of
                                the island. It is possible that she furnishes the schooners with
                                provisions or that she serves them as a storeship. For this reason I
                                resolved to conduct her to Vladivostok. I learned, moreover, from
                                the captain that his first mate, William Jong, had landed twelve
                                years ago from a schooner upon the island of Tuleny, where he had
                                killed 13,000 seals during one summer, from which it appears that
                                among the bark’s crew there were experts at this industry.</p>
                            <p>Finding it impossible to inspect the hold, and thus convince myself
                                of the bark’s participation in this sort of illegal industry, I took
                                the above-mentioned determination, to the end, moreover, that a
                                commission, specially appointed, might examine the hold and
                                ascertain the truth.</p>
                            <p>I learned from the captain that he had asked through the medium of
                                the governor of the maritime province permission to engage in
                                whaling in the bays of the sea of Okhotsk, and had offered our
                                Government $500 dollars to obtain that privilege, but permission was
                                emphatically refused. I knew that the clipper <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Abrek</hi> had overhauled and detained this same bark off the
                                Chantarsky Islands, but had not seized her because she had no whales
                                on board, but had warned her that the industry was illegitimate.
                                Haying examined her chart I found that she had lingered several
                                times near the Russian coast, even in the gulf of Peter the Great,
                                between the island of Askold and the shore, in the gulfs of Patience
                                and of Aniva, off the coast of Cape Aniva, and had engaged at that
                                place in whaling, all of which I judge from the signs upon the chart
                                I learned from the captain that in these waters the bark <hi
                                    rend="italic">Morgan</hi>, belonging to the same party, and the
                                schooner <hi rend="italic">Mary H. Thomas</hi> were engaged in
                                whaling. The bark <hi rend="italic">Morgan</hi> not succeeding in
                                her effort in these parts had gone to the north coast of the
                                peninsula of Kamchatka, and had proposed to the captain of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> to accompany her, but the
                                latter had refused. The captain declared that to the north of the
                                sea of Okhotsk, in the bays, were two English steamers, the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Northless</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Norwall</hi>, and the American brig <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Hidalgo</hi>, engaged in whaling. Taking into consideration all
                                the preceding and having weighed all of the circumstances for and
                                against, I concluded to conduct the said bark to Vladivostok, in
                                order that the matter might be carefully investigated whether or not
                                the industry in which she engaged and her sojourn in our waters was
                                legitimate. For this purpose I required the bark’s crew to board the
                                schooner <hi rend="italic">Maria</hi>, with the exception of the
                                captain, the steward, and a small boy in the captain’s service. The
                                first mate, William Jong, was named in the capacity of captain of
                                the schooner, to whom the order was given to conduct her to
                                Vladivostok.</p>
                            <p>I, with Ensign Simansky and all of my crew, composed of twelve men,
                                went aboard the bark. The whole affair was accomplished at half past
                                9 in the morning, and at 10 o’clock in the morning of August 29 the
                                bark and the schooner filled away <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293"
                                    facs="0315"/>toward the Strait of Laperouse. The schooner soon
                                disappeared in the fog. Astern was another schooner, which also soon
                                disappeared. At half past 7 in the evening a brisk wind, SSE.,
                                arose. As the bark had no balast I brailed up sails. The vessel
                                leaned to greatly; it was evident she oscillated greatly. The first
                                day the crew was occupied cleaning the quarters, which were in very
                                bad condition. At night the wind changed from SSE. to NW. I
                                continued in the same direction and sighted the summits of Cape
                                Aniva; in the morning I augmented sail. At noon, August 30 (11th
                                September), I stood in 46° 18′5 latitude north and 144° 14′
                                longitude east. In the evening, the wind becoming brisk, I
                                diminished sail. At 7.40 in the evening I sighted Cape Aniva, 2
                                miles distant. The night of August 311 was in the Strait of
                                Laperouse. Heavy fog; course WSW. ½ W.; now and again two lights
                                were seen to starboard and port. Wishing to avoid danger, I sailed
                                to SW.; having made 10 miles in that direction, I turned WNW. At 7
                                a.m. I sighted the light-house of Soiou.</p>
                            <p>At 8 a.m., having doubled Soiou, I took the course 10 miles to the
                                north of Rebouksiri. At 2 p.m. I sailed toward Cape Nizmenny.
                                Throughout this time a steady wind was blowing from NE.; speed from
                                5 to 8 knots. At noon September 1 (13) there were no astronomical
                                observations taken. The wind had changed to NW. and toward evening
                                began to freshen. I diminished sail. The wind abated about morning;
                                I augmented sail. At noon September 2 (14) I made 42° 25′ latitude
                                north and 136° 48′ longitude east. I had been carried southward. I
                                had steered west as much as a NNW. wind permitted. Wind feeble;
                                speed 3 knots.</p>
                            <p>At noon September 3 (15) I made observation 42° 13′ north latitude,
                                135° 48′ east longitude. After midday I sailed to NW., nearer to
                                shore, hoping to profit of the coast wind. On the morning of
                                September 4 (16) I sighted the coast. At 9 a.m. I tacked. At noon I
                                ascertained 42° 59′ latitude north and 135° 61′ longitude east. From
                                Cape Krasny to the southeast for 23 miles. Wind W/5. I went about.
                                The bark tacks well without losing headway. We lost much time while
                                tacking, on account of the unskillfulness of the men at the helm. On
                                September 5 (17) I tacked opposite the shore to WSW. At 8 o’clock I
                                had favorable wind and sailed westward. At 6 o’clock I took my
                                bearings; island of Petrow at No. 1, 40 to 13½ miles. At 9.50 p.m. I
                                sighted a revolving light, which soon disappeared in the fog. During
                                the night of September 6 (18) I continued my course westward. In the
                                morning contrary wind from WNW. I sailed northward. At noon of 6th
                                (18) 42° 17′ latitude north and 133° 0′ 6″ longitude east. At 2.45,
                                nearing the shore, I tacked to westward. When it grew dark the
                                Askold light could no longer be seen, in spite of the short
                                distance. The night of the 7th (19th) off Askold, dead calm, the
                                lights were not visible. At 7 o’clock a northwest wind prevailed. I
                                sailed in a northwesterly direction, advancing on the light-house of
                                Skryplew. At 10.30 the schooner <hi rend="italic">Vancouver
                                    Belle</hi> came to meet me. I signaled (B. L. M.) asking that
                                steam launches be sent to tow me.</p>
                            <p>At 3 o’clock I entered Vladivostok and cast starboard anchor.</p>
                            <p>During the entire passage both crews behaved well. The schooner’s
                                crew was divided into three watches, the bark’s into two; 5 men in
                                each. Knowing the fatigue of two watches, I endeavored to give the
                                men as much free time as possible and to avoid superfluous work.
                                They were often obliged to pump the water from the hold, for during
                                the day it accumulated to a depth of from 10 to 20 inches. It is
                                very evident that somewhere about the bark there is a leak.</p>
                            <p>The health of the crew was excellent throughout the passage. No one
                                applied to me for medical assistance.</p>

                            <p>In conformity with order No. 160 of the commander of the Pacific
                                Squadron dated the 11th September, 1892, the commission appointed by
                                that order, and composed of the Ship’s Captain Hessen, president;
                                Ship’s Captain Zarine, Captains of Frigate de Livron and Philissow,
                                and of the auditor chief counselor of the college Yanevitch
                                Yanevsky, members, with Lieutenant Petrow, executive officer,
                                proceeded to execute the work intrusted to them, took cognizance of
                                the circumstances of the seizure of the American whaling bark <hi
                                    rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon.</hi></p>
                            <p>From the report of Lieutenant von Cube, who seized said bark, it
                                appeared that he had been detailed from aboard the first-class
                                cruiser <hi rend="italic">Vitiaz</hi> aboard the schooner <hi
                                    rend="italic">Maria</hi>, seized by the cruiser for illegal seal
                                fishing, for the purpose of conducting her to Vladivostok during the
                                voyage, when in 46° 33′ latitude north and 140° 30′ longtitude east
                                he sighted the bark <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, and,
                                suspecting it of engaging in the same <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294"
                                    facs="0316"/>illegal industry, he sent his Second Ship’s Ensign
                                Simansky with armed sailors to ascertain what vessel it was, and
                                what its mission. Having learned from the bark’s Captain Thomas
                                Scullun, who returned with Lieutenant Simansky, that it was a
                                whaling vessel having aboard at that moment the product of two
                                whales killed by him, Lieutenant von Cube found it impossible to
                                abandon his first intention. Moreover, on examining the log book and
                                the navigation chart of the bark, he was convinced that the latter
                                had on several occasions approached the Russian coast of the sea of
                                Okhotsk, where whaling is absolutely interdicted to foreigners.
                                Furthermore, Lieutenant von Cube was confirmed in this opinion by
                                the circumstance that at the approach of the schooner the bark had
                                hoisted a signal, which, according to Captain Scullun’s explanation,
                                had been intended for the schooner <hi rend="italic">Mary H.
                                    Thomas</hi>, expected that same night, and which also engaged in
                                whaling and sealing. In view of these facts, Lieutenant von Cube
                                considered it incumbent upon him, in the interest of the Russian
                                Government, to conduct said bark to Vladivostok in order that the
                                question might be decided at once whether or not she should be
                                confiscated. But not having at his disposal a crew sufficiently
                                numerous to put a portion of it upon the bark, and not wishing to
                                trust to the bark’s crew, he decided to go aboard the bark with his
                                entire crew, and to keep with him the bark’s captain he transferred
                                the captain’s mate, with the entire crew of the bark, aboard the
                                schooner <hi rend="italic">Maria</hi> and ordered them to repair to
                                Vladivostok. The <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> arrived at
                                Vladivostok on the 7th September and the schooner several days
                                earlier.</p>
                            <p>The commission at once took cognizance of the statements relating to
                                this affair, as well as of the documents in evidence, such as the
                                log book kept by Lieutenant von Cube on the schooner <hi
                                    rend="italic">Maria</hi>, and afterwards on the bark <hi
                                    rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, the log book of the latter
                                kept by Captain Scullun, the sailing papers of the bark taken from
                                the captain by Lieutenant von Cube, the navigation chart of the bark
                                and the instructions given to commanders of Russian cruisers on
                                being sent north, to regulate their conduct when boarding and
                                seizing schooners suspected of marauding.</p>
                            <p>From the above-mentioned documents and the examination of said bark
                                made by the commission (of which the protocol is hereunto attached)
                                results the following:</p>
                            <p>1. The bark <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> having left
                                Vladivostok on June 22 (7th July) of this year without obtaining the
                                permission sought for to take whales in the bays and coast waters of
                                the Sea of Okhotsk, caught two whales in said sea; she sighted the
                                first of these and began the chase at 5 miles from the island of
                                Askold, but was not successful in catching it there.</p>
                            <p>During her cruise to the west of Cape Aniva, she communicated several
                                times while at sea with the schooner <hi rend="italic">Mary H.
                                    Thomas</hi>, which, according to Captain Scullun’s statement, is
                                engaged in whaling and sealing.</p>
                            <p>2. Whaling in the Sea of Okhotsk is not interdicted to foreigners
                                except in the bays, the gulfs, and straits, and in coast waters or
                                along shore. It is even permitted to foreign fishing vessels in
                                cases of extreme necessity to enter the bays and gulfs, provided
                                they do not enter into such negotiations with the inhabitants as are
                                forbidden by law.</p>
                            <p>3. Upon the bark were found the oil and bone of two whales killed, as
                                said the captain, in the Sea of Okhotsk, in that part wherein whale
                                fishing is permitted; but although the statements of the captain
                                were confirmed by the log book and the chart, the commission did not
                                consider this fact sufficiently proven.</p>
                            <p>4. The conduct of Lieutenant von Cube at the time of the seizure of
                                the bark is considered by the commission perfectly regular, inasmuch
                                as overhauling a suspicious vessel, in a suspicious locality, he
                                could not do otherwise than seize it and submit to an investigation
                                as to the legitimacy of the seizure by a superior authority. The
                                commission will not fail to notice here that the mere feat alone of
                                detaining a bark with a crew numbering 30 men by the much less
                                numerous crew of the schooner shows the initiative spirit and
                                resolution of Lieutenant von Cube.</p>
                            <p>In consequence of the preceding and the impossibility of establishing
                                the fact that the two whales had been taken by the bark in that
                                portion of the Sea of Okhotsk where whaling is prohibited, the
                                commission is of opinion that the position of the bark near the
                                Russian coasts does not of itself constitute an illegal act, and it
                                declares that for this reason the bark <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                                    Pigeon</hi> can not be convicted of having engaged in
                                illegitimate business, and it does not see sufficient motives for
                                its confiscation.</p>

                        <head>Seizure and confiscation of the schooner James Hamilton Lewis.</head>
                        <p>The American schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was
                            detained and confiscated under the following circumstances:</p>
                        <p>On the 21st of July (August 2), at 4.40 a.m., from on board the screw
                            ship <hi rend="italic">Aleout</hi>, Russian man-of-war, coming from the
                            western coast of the island of Medny, and being about 2 miles north of
                            the southern extremity of that island, a sailing schooner was sighted
                            ahead nearing the shore to northeast which was found to be the American
                            schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, from San
                            Francisco, under command of Captain MacLean. Having orders from his
                            superiors to effectually protect the Russian fisheries of Bering Sea
                            against foreign marauders, Captain Brandt advanced immediately upon the
                            suspected schooner, which was, judging from the clearness with which her
                            sails were visible, at a distance of 6 miles at the most from the <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleout</hi>, and of 5 miles at most from the southern
                            extremity of the island of Medny. (See the points A, B, and C on the
                            appended chart.) Remarking the conduct of the man-of-war, the American
                            schooner veered immediately to the southeast and fled under full sail.
                            The <hi rend="italic">Aleout</hi>, increasing her speed, went in pursuit
                            of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, from the deck of
                            which some objects were being thrown overboard. On approaching the
                            latter at 6.15 the <hi rend="italic">Aleout</hi> hoisted her colors and
                            fired a blank shot, upon which the sailing schooner lay to. Lieutenant
                            Lebedew and Ensign Engmann were sent in a ship’s boat to board her, and
                            received at first, by way of explanation from Captain MacLean, that the
                            afore-named schooner was engaged in fishing and hunting of sea birds;
                            that it carried a crew of 25 men, and that it had already delivered the
                            fruits of their industry to another schooner off the coast of Alaska. On
                            investigation it was found that the present crew numbered 22 men in all.
                            In the main hold were evidences of a hasty removal of objects and a
                            washing (a tub with reddened water, covered with a shirt, etc.); also a
                            large quantity of salt in the scantling along the ship’s side and in
                            sacks, with seal skins scattered about. Moveover, upon the schooner were
                            found a great many arms, powder, and paraphernalia for catching seals.
                            In the schooner’s log book delivered by the captain the last entry
                            related to the 7th (19th) of June; the ship’s journal bore no
                            inscription. In consequence of the report of Lieutenant Lebedew as to
                            what he had found, Captain Brandt sent this same officer again with six
                            sailors to the schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> to
                            notify the captain that the vessel was seized and to order him to report
                            with a portion of his crew on board the <hi rend="italic">Aleout</hi>.
                            Not only did Captain MacLean refuse to comply with this order, but made
                            an insolent reply, as did also his mate, MacDonald, and, weighing
                            anchor, attempted to sail away from the boat, seeing which Lieutenant
                                <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0319"/>Lebedew fired his revolver
                            in air by way of signaling his commander. The <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aleout</hi> in great haste fired a cannon shot ahead and gave
                            verbal order to the American vessel to lay to. The latter, however,
                            continued her course in the same direction. A second shot was fired into
                            her rigging, and the order to lay to was repeated, but without result,
                            after which the <hi rend="italic">Aleout</hi>, sailing in front of the
                                <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, barred her course. The
                            American vessel, after a third shot fired at her starboard side, was
                            overhauled at 11 or 12 miles off the island of Medny and taken in tow.
                            After an inspection in detail of the arrested schooner a large number of
                            seal skins were discovered and a new bag net for catching beaver, and
                            two seal skins so small that from their age they could not have been
                            killed elsewhere than on the shore. Deciding to confiscate the American
                            vessel for illegal fishing in Russian waters, Captain Brandt dispatched
                            her to Petropavlosk and Vladivostok, under the command of Lieutenant
                            Lebedew. Captain MacLean, with the crew, was likewise dispatched by
                            special steamer under surveillance on account of the resistance he had
                            made to his arrest. A statement was drawn up relating all of the
                            measures taken by the <hi rend="italic">Aleout</hi>. Captain MacLean set
                            forth his views in his protest of August 12, 1891. (See Exhibits I, II,
                            III, IV, V, VI, and VII.)</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">objections to the grounds of the
                                case.</hi></p>
                        <p>All of the facts above mentioned are exactly confirmed by the reports
                            duly submitted by the officers of the Russian man-of-war, by the log
                            book of the latter, by the chart showing the locality where the incident
                            occurred, and by the formal statements drawn up on the subject of the
                            seizure of the American schooner. These documents on account of their
                            contents and of their import can not be invalidated by the allegations
                            devoid of sufficient proofs furnished by persons interested in the case.
                            It is therefore proper to consider as an established fact that the
                            schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> having in the
                            morning approached the coast of the Medny Island, concerning which
                            restrictive measures had been taken, and being at the most 5 miles off
                            the southern extremity of this island, veered about suddenly on
                            perceiving the <hi rend="italic">Aleout</hi>, which appeared
                            unexpectedly in her course; that it endeavored in every way to elude the
                            latter in open sea, and that thanks solely to the great speed of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleout</hi> it was obliged to lay to, on hearing the
                            warning cannon shot; that Captain MacLean’s first explanations were not
                            truthful and were given the lie at once by the Russian officer, who
                            discovered the true character of the American schooner, having
                            satisfactory proof that the aforesaid captain, seeing himself convicted
                            of falsehood, endeavored to extricate himself by flight, and after a
                            useless resistance to the orders of Captain Brandt, yielded finally to
                            Russian arms; that upon the detained schooner were found hidden
                            evidences of recent seal fishing and two skins of seals so young that
                            they could not have been killed elsewhere than upon the shore of the
                            Commander Island.</p>
                        <p>All of these facts sufficiently prove that on the 21st July (August 2),
                            1891, the schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was at
                            sea with the secret intention of continuing, off the Medny Island, the
                            occupation of illegal seal fishing, while the product of her former
                            catch was already stored away in the hold of the vessel, and that fear
                            alone of having to answer for his actions explains Captain MacLean’s
                            behavior.</p>
                        <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0320"/>
                        <p>Certainly the important allegations made by the latter that he had
                            approached shore to verify his chronometer could not be substantiated by
                            any of the ship’s documents, calculations, etc. This statement appears
                            as unlikely as his other explanations, which were totally untrue,
                            particularly his statements that the two skins of small seals found
                            aboard were skins of animals taken from the bodies of their mothers
                            which had been killed in mid seas, which are contradicted by the
                            testimony of an expert, the chief of the Commander Islands, rendered
                            upon the basis of an examination of the actual objects under discussion;
                            and for this reason the opinions presented by the claimant on the
                            subject of the modus vivendi of seals of both sexes are not convincing
                            in the matter. Finally, the refusal of the captain to comply with the
                            order of the commander of the Russian man-of-war constitutes strong
                            proof of his guilt of infraction of the order maintained in those
                            parts.</p>
                        <p>The assertion of the party claimant that the schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >James Hamilton Lewis</hi> had not previously entered Russian
                            territorial waters and had but that very day approached the Medny Island
                            merits special attention. This essential circumstance of the affair
                            should be, above all, proven by the vessel itself, more particularly as
                            the Russian officer asked to see the documents which would indicate the
                            previous course of the American schooner in open sea or in proximity to
                            the coast. In any event Captain MacLean, intentionally it would seem,
                            turned over only the official log book, which had no bearing upon the
                            present question, but withheld the daily journal, in which the vessel’s
                            exact course could be determined by the daily entries.</p>
                        <p>Realizing, therefore, the extreme importance of having failed in this
                            particular and of not having performed his duty, the party claimant then
                            refers in its claim to extracts or copies from the log book, wherein
                            were noted the geographical positions of the <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lends</hi> at different stages of her voyage, but the
                            original documents remained always in its own hands, and were never
                            shown except during verbal explanations with the representative of the
                            United States in 1898. Finally, owing to repeated demands by the
                            defendant party, on the 21st of May of this same year, that is to say,
                            six years and nine months after the incident of the 21st of July (August
                            12), 1891, said log book was transmitted to the defendant party, after
                            which, by Russian authority, the following note was made upon the
                            original: “This log book has been examined by the minister of marine and
                            returned to the minister of foreign affairs by an act of August 4, 1898,
                            No. 527.” This inscription is not found in the copy of the document now
                            given to the defendant party, which fact he believes necessary to state
                            here.</p>
                        <p>It would be difficult to find an explanation giving ground for a
                            favorable interpretation of the fact that the log book of the schooner
                                <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, as principal proof of
                            his full right, was not presented at the critical moment of his seizure.
                            The least likely explanation would assuredly be that of lack of
                            confidence, which must have been offensive, on the part of the captain
                            toward the commander of the Russian man-of-war. Still less
                            comprehensible is the delay of the party claimant to present this
                            justificatory document, to which both parties can not fail to attach the
                            greatest importance, in the examination of the claim, and for this
                            reason the defendant must be circumspect in regard to his admission of
                            the authenticity of its contents. <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299"
                                facs="0321"/>Having examined the original in 1898, he was convinced
                            of the utter inapplication of that element of proof to the defendant’s
                            interests. The log book represents a record of the fishing trip of the
                            schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>. On the title page
                            is written, “Illegally seized August 2 by the Russian man-of-war <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleout.</hi>” That is to say, there is a note
                            foretelling that which took place about five months after the departure
                            of the vessel from San Francisco, the 7th of March, 1891. The impression
                            is at once given that this title and the corresponding text were written
                            after the events of which the log book should serve as decisive proofs.
                            This opinion is corroborated by the outward suspicious appearance of the
                            document in question; the inscriptions are made with the same ink, and
                            appear to be copied from some other record; they have not the appearance
                            of inscriptions made on different dates during the entire period between
                            the 7th of March and the month of August, 1891, but all at one time. The
                            added protest of Captain MacLean at the end of the diary and the mention
                            of the number of seals killed at sea in 1891, viz, 424 seals illegally
                            caught, equally testify to the ulterior composition of the document, the
                            value of which could only consist in having been preserved intact, such
                            as it was on the 21st of July (August 2), 1891. All of the above data is
                            convincing that aboard the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>
                            at the time of her seizure there were no regular entries as to her daily
                            navigation in the ship’s journal, as has been previously shown in the
                            act of confiscation on the 30th July (August 11), 1891. (Exhibit II.)
                            Consequently the log book presented by the claimant does not furnish
                            proof of an alibi of the vessel in question; on the contrary, it serves
                            as better evidence for the party opposed to the claim. The <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> had not noted her position
                            at sea on the eve of her seizure, although she was undoubtedly at that
                            time in the proximity of the Russian coast and was engaged in illegal
                            sealing.</p>
                        <p>In view of these facts, the defendant party concludes that the marauding
                            character of the schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> in
                            Russian waters is sufficiently proven; therefore the Russian Government
                            confirms the decision relating to the confiscation of the vessel, by its
                            sovereign right, and in defense of its legitimate interests against all
                            infringements thereon.</p>
                        <p>There can be no question as to the right of the constituted agents to
                            pursue delinquent vessels beyond territorial waters, as was done in the
                            present case, when the war ship sighted the schooner in the proximity of
                            Russian coasts; that is to say, 5 miles from the shore, and overhauled
                            her finally at a distance of from 11 to 12 miles from the Medny Island.
                            Therein the principles of the liberty of the high seas are not violated,
                            as they are understood by the representatives of contemporaneous
                            science.</p>
                        <p>The question which suggests itself here is the one until now contested,
                            viz, what is the extent of the “territorial sea,” but in this respect it
                            must be remembered that according to the accepted principle of
                            international law, the limits of territorial waters are really deter
                            mined by the possibility for the bordering State to establish its
                            sovereignty over a certain extent of sea constituting a prolongation of
                            its territory. (Terræ dominum finitur ubi finitur armorum vis.) With the
                            resources of defense which nations have at the present time at their
                            command, the perfection of firearms, the complexity of the conditions of
                            existence, need of order, military, financial, and economical, <pb
                                n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0322"/>all limitations too narrow for
                            the full manifestation of the sovereignty of a country, as, for
                            instance, the fixation at 3 marine miles as the limit of territorial
                            waters of which the party claimant makes mention, should be considered
                            as arbitrary, devoid of all practical sense, and not serving their ends.
                            In any case, the limits of territorial waters according to the doctrine
                            of international law most recently accepted should be extended not only
                            beyond 3 miles, but even beyond 5 miles, starting from low-water mark.
                            (Session de Paris de 1894 de l’Institut de droit international.)</p>
                        <p>It would be well, moreover, to take into consideration the particulars of
                            the present case arising from acts whose object it is to legally protect
                            the seal fisheries in Bering Sea. From the facts set forth in detail in
                            the case of <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> (third case) it appears
                            that the United States had come to recognize the necessity for
                            exceptional measures in this respect, yet in spite of these exigencies
                            regarding prohibited zones, went beyond that which was deemed necessary
                            by the Russian Government.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party does not intend to sustain here the point of view of
                            the American Government according to which seals, not being feræ naturæ,
                            are domestic animals having the animus rivertendi characteristic of the
                            latter; but it believes it well to recall that at the time the claimant
                            supported that opinion before the arbitration tribunal of Paris, in
                            claiming a property right over all the seals that frequented the islands
                            of Pribilof, American marauders were exterminating seals on the Russian
                            coasts of Commander Islands. The United States Government then arrived
                            at the conclusion that it was necessary to entirely interdict the
                            killing of seals in open sea (pelagic sealing), with a view to
                            preserving that race of animals in the Pacific Ocean. (Revue de droit
                            international, 1893. Tome XXV, p. 434, etc.) After setting forth the
                            above points, which in the opinion of the defendant party render
                            inapplicable the principles invoked by the party claimant as the basis
                            of the affair, it is useless to enter into an examination of the several
                            points of the claim, limiting oneself to the following remarks:</p>
                        <p>With regard to the allegations not sustained by sufficient proofs
                            concerning the bad treatment to which the men of the crew of the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> may have been subjected, it
                            is well to note that, on the contrary, the men themselves made the most
                            violent’ resistance to the orders of the officers of the cruiser <hi
                                rend="italic">Aleout</hi>, by which they made necessary decisive
                            measures on the part of the Russian authorities. The defendant party
                            energetically protests against these allegations which are not proven.
                            To contest this portion of the claim, of which the total reaches the sum
                            of $34,000, as well as the claims for indemnity for losses on the value
                            of the confiscated vessel ($25,000) and her cargo ($5,936), also that in
                            regard to the claim for indemnity for the loss of a probable profit
                            ($36,400) and interest ($54,721.44), It suffices to refer to the
                            explanations given concerning similar questions in the cases of <hi
                                rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon, C. H White</hi>, and <hi
                                rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>. (Cases I, II, III.)</p>
                        <p>There still remains to be mentioned that the compromise recently proposed
                            in regard to the payment of a sum of $82,000 instead of $156,057.44, now
                            claimed, plainly shows that the first calculations of the claimant were
                            not well founded.</p>

                                    Schooner Aleout to the Commander of the Port of Vladivostok,
                                    dated August</hi> 3, 1891. No. 385.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to report to your excellency that on the morning of
                                July 4, off the southern extremity of the Medney Island, from on
                                board the schooner commanded by me, was sighted a two-mast sailing
                                vessel approaching the island, which, having sighted the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Aleout</hi>, fled under full sail. For the purpose
                                of inspecting, I overhauled her 12 miles from the island, and having
                                made the inspection, suspecting her of engaging in illegal sealing,
                                I detained and confiscated her on discovering aboard many seal skins
                                salted down, arms, powder, and shot. This incident is set forth in
                                the act hereunto annexed of the confiscation of the schooner. This
                                act has been read and signed by the captain of the schooner and in
                                this act his protest is set forth. All of the seal skins were turned
                                over by me to the chief of district of the Commander Islands to be
                                sent to London and sold on behalf of the Government, thinking thus
                                to obtain better prices than at Vladivostok.</p>
                            <p>The schooner was at once conducted to Petropavlosk, and will thence
                                be sent to Vladivostok under command of Lieutenant Lebedew. As it
                                was impossible to spare enough men from the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Aleout</hi>, I placed 6 of her sailors aboard the sailing
                                vessel with 6 of the American crew already there. Captain MacLean
                                and the 10 remaining men of his crew I put under surveillance, to be
                                sent on the steamer <hi rend="italic">Vladivostok</hi> to
                                Vladivostok, in conformity with instructions which I received, on
                                account of the resistance made when arrested, when it proved
                                necessary to take decisive measures to compel her to stop her
                                course. While the attitude of the crew was for the most part
                                apparently passive, next to the captain the most noticeable was the
                                first mate, MacDonald, who, according to accounts, not entirely
                                confirmed, however, drew a knife at the moment of arrest; therefore
                                I decided to send the entire crew to Vladivostok, that the local
                                authorities might pass upon the matter. The chief of district of
                                Petropavlosk, in view of the great need of boats by the inhabitants
                                of that town and the neighboring villages, asked me if I could not
                                sell some of the boats of the confiscated vessel. I consented, and
                                of the six boats I authorized the sale of three at auction. The sum
                                realized by this sale will be handed by me to the administrator of
                                the port of Vladivostok. I also transmit herewith to your excellency
                                the ship’s papers of the confiscated schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                    >James Hamilton Lewis</hi>. I send the said documents by steamer
                                    <hi rend="italic">Vladivostok</hi>, although the sailing vessel
                                    <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> will probably reach Vladivostok
                                before the steamer.</p>

                            <p>For the purpose of inspecting we advanced straight upon her, but,
                                sighting us, she filled away, augmenting sails. While pursuing her
                                we noticed that something was being hurriedly thrown overboard. At
                                6.15 we neared her and, hoisting our colors, fired a blank shot, on
                                which the vessel hoisted the American flag and lay to. Two officers,
                                sent to board her, returned reporting that she was a sailing vessel
                                from San Francisco bearing the name <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                    Lewis</hi>, and that on board were guns, many cartridges, powder
                                and shot, slender rods of bamboo with hooks and grappling irons for
                                drawing seals from the water, 6 long boats and a crew of 16 men, a
                                large quantity of salt, and evident signs of the operation of
                                removing the skins from seals. In the official log book which was
                                produced the last inscription was on the 7th (19th) of June. The
                                journal of navigation bore no inscription.</p>
                            <p>Taking this data into consideration, an officer was sent, with 6
                                sailors, to inform the captain that his schooner was under
                                detention, and to require him to report with a portion of his crew
                                on board the schooner <hi rend="italic">Aleout</hi> The captain
                                refused to comply with this order, and sailed away. Leaving the
                                ship’s boat to follow, the schooner <hi rend="italic">Aleout</hi>
                                pursued the vessel, and, in order to compel her to stop, fired a
                                cannon ahead, in spite of which, and the verbal order to come to,
                                the schooner did not lay to, but continued her course. The <hi
                                    rend="italic">Aleout</hi> passed close under her stern and,
                                repeating the verbal order to stop, fired a second shot into her
                                forward rigging. The <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> did
                                not lay to, but continued her flight.</p>
                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Aleout</hi> increasing her speed barred the
                                way, when the James <hi rend="italic">Hamilton Lewis</hi>, fouling
                                the starboard side of the <hi rend="italic">Aleout</hi>, was seized
                                and taken in tow. Captain MacLean with his entire crew was conducted
                                on board the <hi rend="italic">Aleout</hi> and was informed that his
                                vessel was seized and would be taken to Nicolsk, on Bering Island.
                                Being taken in tow, the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>
                                was, upon inspection, found to contain a large quantity of seal
                                skins, a bag net for catching sea otters, and two skins of small
                                seals, which from their tender age, according to the opinion of an
                                expert, the chief of the Commander Islands, could not have been
                                killed elsewhere than upon the shore. The ship’s papers were taken,
                                and the captain was informed that the vessel <hi rend="italic">James
                                    Hamilton Lewis</hi> was confiscated for having engaged in
                                illegal and unauthorized hunting in Russian waters.</p>

                            <p>All seal skins on board of said schooner were killed upon the water

                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Report of Lieutenant Lebedew to
                                    the Commander of the Screw Schooner Aleout.</hi></p>
                            <p>On the 21st of July, as we sailed in sight of the island of Medny, in
                                obedience to your order, I left the ship commanded by you, and
                                taking my place in a long boat at about 7 a.m., with Ensign Engmann,
                                I advanced upon a schooner carrying the American flag, which lay to
                                at a distance of about 3 cables’ length to leeward. Having covered
                                about half the distance I read upon the stern of the schooner the
                                name <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, San Francisco.</p>
                            <p>Approaching her from windward, I boarded her on the starboard side
                                and ascended to the deck and put the following question: “Who is
                                captain here? I must speak with him.” A man approached who said he
                                was captain of the schooner. I next asked him if he was the ship’s
                                owner, to which he replied in the negative, and designated as owner
                                a certain Lewis or some such name. To my question, What was the
                                schooner’s business, he replied; “Hunting and fishing” (hunting of
                                sea birds). When I asked the number of men in the crew he at first
                                replied 25, but when I required the captain to call all of his men
                                on deck and asked him for his ship’s papers and the log book to
                                verify the crew, he delivered his papers and informed me that his
                                crew numbered 22, but that two had deserted and four had been lost
                                in the fog while fishing off Sandy Point.</p>
                            <p>Having told the captain that I was sent by the commander of the
                                Russian man-of-war to inspect his vessel, I left Ensign Engmann on
                                the deck to watch the crew, and I with the captain descended to the
                                hold; There I ordered the removal of the planks beneath which were
                                casks of fresh water. Then I ordered a hand pump to be brought, and
                                while the captain busied himself lifting the planks I put the pump
                                in place and began to examine this place, and found there salt piled
                                in sacks along the sides and a quantity loose upon the floor. There
                                was also a tub containing reddened water covered with a red flannel
                                shirt. Over all were noticeable signs of a hasty putting to rights
                                and of washing.</p>
                            <p>To my question where they keep the fish they had caught, the captain
                                answered that the cargo had already been transported to another
                                schooner off the coast of Alaska, and that they had but this very
                                day arrived in our waters. Pretending to be satisfied with these
                                replies, I next inspected the quarters of the crew. These quarters
                                were very narrow and communicated with the kitchen or galley by
                                means of a window or slide through which dishes could be passed. I
                                next inspected the cabin astern, containing eight beds, and bunks in
                                which four more persons could easily sleep. At the end of the common
                                cabin there was a door opening into the captain’s cabin; I did not
                                enter there. Along the partitions near the bunks I saw eight guns of
                                different models, and there also were wooden rods in greater number
                                than the guns. Returning to the deck I examined the long boats; in
                                one there was a box covered with a coarse red cloth containing
                                ship’s biscuit and other edibles; in another were two bamboo rods
                                with pointed ends and iron hooks. Having informed the captain that I
                                must show his log book to my commander, I received it and left in
                                the boat to return to the <hi rend="italic">Aleout</hi>, where I
                                made my verbal report of all I had seen and heard, and expressed the
                                opinion that the arrested schooner was a poacher and not merely
                                engaged in fishing and hunting. Having then received orders to
                                return to the vessel with a quartermaster and five armed sailors to
                                bring the captain and a portion of his crew aboard the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Aleout</hi>, and to assume command of the schooner
                                to conduct her whither you should order, I left in the rowboat.
                                During this time the distance between the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Aleout</hi> and the schooner had noticeably increased.
                                Approaching the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> I
                                ascended to the deck, boarding her on starboard side, and delivered
                                your order to the captain. I received by way of answer that he could
                                not leave his vessel at sea, and if my commander desired to speak
                                with him he could come to him. This reply was received with marked
                                approval by a portion of the crew: “Certainly; let him come to us if
                                he wishes; we are beyond Russian waters,” etc.</p>
                            <p>During my interview with the captain one of his men seemed especially
                                to sustain him; it proved to be the first mate; the latter passed
                                back of me as if to seize me from behind; I turned suddenly upon him
                                and informed him he would wait a long time for my commander to come
                                aboard, and that the captain and crew would do well to comply at
                                once with his orders. I had not finished speaking when the vessel
                                filled away, leaning dangerously above our small boat, and sailed
                                away. Then I returned in the ship’s boat to the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Aleout</hi> to report to you.</p>
                            <p>On nearing the <hi rend="italic">Aleout</hi> I called to you Fire
                                upon them, they are rascals.” Scarcely hoping that you had heard me,
                                I pointed to the flying vessel and fired my revolver <pb n="304"
                                    xml:id="pg_304" facs="0326"/>in air. Approaching still nearer, I
                                heard your order to follow in the ship’s boat, which I did,
                                endeavoring to avoid any interference with your movements or your
                                guns. I submit this my report of the preceding.</p>

                                searched in detail. There were found aboard of her guns underneath
                                the mattresses. A pocket revolver was taken from the cook; in the
                                galley were found two small seal skins hanging on nails in the
                                partition to dry; in the forehold, under the trap, ten or more large
                                tin boxes containing gunpowder; in the hold to starboard of traps
                                were wooden boxes filled with large shot and cartridges, and similar
                                cartridges and shots were found under the bunks and beds in the
                                after cabin.</p>
                            <p>Under a platform and under the mess table were cases filled with
                                cartridges of larger caliber, charged with shrapnel; other boxes
                                contained cartridge shells which had not been filled. There was also
                                a large bag net, quite new, worth $600, as said the American sailors
                                who remained aboard the schooner; this bag net was used for catching
                                sea otters.</p>
                            <p>During the inspection of the main hold by the quartermaster,
                                Lestchew, it was found upon scattering the salt piled on the floor
                                that seal skins had been packed therein. Being convinced that among
                                the sacks containing salt one had been hastily filled with seal
                                skins, I ordered that all be left intact until the examination by
                                the commission; that is to say, until the arrival in the village of
                                Nikolsky, on Bering Island.</p>

                            <p>In fulfillment of the order of October of the present year, I make
                                report that, according to the log book of the schooner under my
                                command, being on the morning of July 21 off the southern extremity
                                of the island of Medny, I sighted the sailing vessel <hi
                                    rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>. At that moment the
                                sails were distinctly visible, and the schooner was bearing toward
                                the southern extremity of the island. To better elucidate the
                                circumstances, I transmit herewith an extract from the ship’s log
                                and a chart, upon which is indicated the point at which the schooner
                                commanded by me was situated when the sailing vessel was sighted
                                (point “A”). Judging from the clearness with which her sails could
                                be seen, the utmost limit of distance between the two vessels could
                                not have exceeded 6 miles; that is to say, the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was not more than 5 miles off the
                                southern extremity of the Medny Island; that is, at point “C.”</p>
                            <p>At this moment she neared the shore until she sighted the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Aleout</hi>, when she veered quickly and,
                                augmenting sails, hastily fled beyond the limit of territorial
                                waters.</p>
                            <p>The schooner was seized at point “B,” which was 13 miles from the
                                point “A” and 11 miles from Medny Island.</p>

                                vessel hoisted the American flag and fled. At 6.20 we lowered a long
                                boat and sent two officers to inspect her. It was found that aboard
                                the schooner, named <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, was
                                a quantity of salt, piled in the hold and in sacks, also powder and
                                bamboo rods, with hooks and grappling irons for lifting seals from
                                the water. On the return of the boat the crew was armed with
                                revolvers.</p>
                            <p>At 7 o’clock the rowboat, with an officer and a number of the crew,
                                were again sent to detain the vessel. The captain refused to quit
                                his vessel, and sailed on. Leaving the rowboat to follow, we
                                quickened our speed and pursued the schooner. At 7.43 we fired a gun
                                ahead, but the schooner continued her flight in the same direction.
                                Fog began to gather.</p>
                            <p>At 8 o’clock, according to report, all goes well; there are no sick
                                men, no men under arrest, no water in the hold.</p>
                            <p>The captain of the sailing vessel obstinately continued his course,
                                and struck our schooner with his bowsprit a little ahead of the
                                bridge. Her jib boom became tangled with the starboard beam; the jib
                                boom was broken, but the shock was deadened, and the vessel hove
                                alongside, shattering the hammocks in two places, and with one of
                                her sideboards tore the port edge of the starboard side, bent the
                                beam of the stern boat, damaged the awning stay, and scratched the
                                side with her port anchor, which then became detached and fell into
                                the sea. In the meantime Ensign Trentovius, with a portion of the
                                crew, boarded the sailing vessel, which lay alongside, and ordered
                                the captain to report to the commander of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Aleout</hi>. As the vessel was still under sail and striking
                                our side, in brailing up sails she cut a part of our rigging. At
                                8.25 we tendered her a tow cable; and the boat which had approached
                                in the meantime went to get the remainder of the crew. There were 16
                                men of the crew, of whom 4 were at once placed aboard the <hi

                                MacLean, were left on board the <hi rend="italic">Aleout</hi>.
                                Lieutenant Lebedew with 6 men were left aboard the sailing vessel;

                            confiscated under the following circumstances:</p>
                        <p>On the 3d (15th) of July, 1892, at 10.30 p.m., the Russian cruiser <hi
                                rend="italic">Zabiaka</hi>, under command of Captain de Livron,
                            being in 54° 30’ latitude north, and 167° 15’ longitude east from the
                            port cathead in the direction southeast 68, observed at a distance of 2
                            miles a schooner without distinctive lights sailing toward the southern
                            extremity of the island of Medny, in a westerly direction.</p>
                        <p>Having for special mission the protection of the coasts of the Commander
                            Islands in Bering Sea, and suspecting this vessel of being engaged in
                            illegal seal fishing, the commander of the cruiser fired a blank shot,
                            and on approaching the schooner commanded her to lay to. When this order
                            was complied with ah officer was sent in a ship’s boat to the vessel,
                            which was found to be the American schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                                White</hi>, under command of Captain Furman. The officer, after a
                            short inspection of the schooner, discovered in the hold a quantity of
                            seal skins and several seals but recently killed. It was evident from
                            documents presented by the captain that the log book had not been kept
                            during the last two days; and from the entries in the journal, in spite
                            of the explanations made by the captain concerning his previous
                            navigation, it was plain that the schooner had during the two weeks
                            preceding this encounter remained in the proximity of the Commander
                            Islands. For instance, the 12th of June, when according to his
                            statements they were engaged in hunting and fishing 40 miles south of
                            the Agatha Island, they were in reality 8 miles off the Medny Island;
                            the course followed by the schooner on her return voyage brought her 3
                            miles off the southern extremity of that island. In view of this data
                            the schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> was conducted to the
                            village of Meolsk, on Bering Island, where a formal inspection by a
                            special commission was made, which established the presence on board of
                            about 12 tons of salt, 15 seal skins, 5 seals newly killed, different
                            accessories fox catching these animals, powder, and other articles. A
                            protocol relating the details of the episode was immediately drawn up;
                            Captain Furman in it set forth his observations, and his first mate,
                            Andren Ronning, signed the document unreservedly.</p>
                        <p>On the part of the crew of the schooner not the slightest resistance was
                            made to the measures taken by the commander of cruiser. Upon the basis
                            of this protocol, and regulated by the instructions received from
                            governmental authorities, Captain de Livron, by a resolution of 4th
                            (16th) of July, 1892, decided to confiscate the <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                                White</hi> and to send her to Vladivostok; moreover to send the
                            captain and crew to Petropavlovsk, allowing them to return freely to
                            their country. This decision was strictly carried out; Captain Furman
                            and the members of the crew were authorized to remove such effects as
                            belonged to them, <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0331"/>and which in
                            no way constituted the accessories of equipment of the schooner.
                            Furthermore, in conformity with the decision of the commander of the
                            cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaka</hi>, the aliens, who had thus been
                            taken upon Russian territory, whether those of the schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> or of the other confiscated vessels,
                            were conveyed to America on the brig <hi rend="italic">Majestic</hi>.
                            (See Exhibits I, II, and III; Exhibit S annexed to American memorandum,
                            third case.)</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">objections concerning the basis of the
                                affair.</hi></p>
                        <p>From the preceding it appears, in the first place, that the American
                            schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> was detained in her course
                            and seized in 54° 10’ latitude north and in 167° 10’ longitude east, and
                            not in 54° 18’ latitude north and 167° 10’ longitude east—that is to
                            say, in all, a distance of 23 miles, as Captain Furman pretends. The
                            unsubstantiated statements of the latter are contradicted by the
                            official protocol drawn up at that time on the cruiser <hi rend="italic"
                                >Zabiaka</hi> (Exhibit I) and by the official log book of the
                            cruiser for the year 1892 (Exhibit III) while the log book of the
                            schooner was not kept in order precisely during the last days preceding
                            her seizure. Even the observations of the captain of the <hi
                                rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> in the protocol of July 3 (15), 1892,
                            show that he well understood the meaning of the document which he
                            signed, since he endeavored to justify his situation at the time of his
                            encounter with the Russian man-of-war. At all events, the suspicious
                            character of the schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> was
                            established by the fact alone that in flagrant violation of
                            international maritime laws it was sailing far enough into the night
                            without distinctive lights. Moreover, the log book of the vessel served
                            to show the inaccuracy of the captain’s statements relating to his
                            previous course, and proved the schooner’s recent presence in the
                            proximity of the Russian coasts; the course followed on her return
                            voyage indicated a passage at 3 miles off the southern extremity of the
                            Medny Isle. Finally, a casual examination of the hold revealed to the
                            Russian officers the presence of products of illegal seal fishing and
                            confirmed Captain de Livron in his opinion that he had effectually
                            caught up with the marauders almost upon the spot where the offense had
                            been committed, or shortly after the accomplishment of same. Under these
                            circumstances the Russian cruiser, whose special mission it was to
                            strictly guard the fisheries off Commander Islands, could not fail to
                            pursue and seize a foreign vessel which after all doubts as to her
                            pretended nonculpability have been dispelled should have been
                            confiscated in conformity with the prescribed regulations (Exhibit
                            II).</p>
                        <p>In sanctioning the measures taken by her agents in this respect, the
                            Imperial Government does not intend to dispute the principle of
                            international law which recognizes the liberty of the high seas, but
                            thinks there is reason to attribute particular importance to the
                            essential circumstances of this affair without, however, losing sight of
                            the fact that the limits of territorial waters are not at present
                            clearly determined (see second case). It must be chiefly considered that
                            this vessel, which was found to be a poacher (since it is impossible to
                            lend even a semblance of likelihood to the supposition that the
                            schooner, having been detained with the products of a recent catch of
                            these costly animals, could have been engaged in legitimate business
                            during the two weeks which were spent in the proximity of the Russian
                            coasts, where poaching is interdicted), was sighted by the Russian
                            cruiser at a <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0332"/>moment when, after
                            being engaged in illegitimate seal fishing near Russian territory, it
                            was stealing away in the darkness from the pursuit to which it had
                            rendered itself liable. The schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>
                            was definitely seized at a relatively inconsiderable distance from land,
                            but after spending entire days on the point of a seizure, in coast
                            waters, had not time to escape beyond the reach of the armed force of
                            the country upon whose rights it had infringed. The cruiser <hi
                                rend="italic">Zabiaka</hi>, whose special duty it was to watch all
                            suspected vessels about the Commander Islands, had the right to pursue
                            the fleeing schooner and seize her even beyond the limits of territorial
                            waters, according to the Russian law. This point of view must not be
                            regarded as a denial of the principle of the freedom of the high seas,
                            whose object is to attain an advantage of universal interest; that is to
                            say, to protect aliens of all countries in peaceful occupations, but not
                            individuals guilty of harmful attacks upon the rights of others. It is
                            not to be expected that vessels engaged in marauding will not be seized
                            in every case beyond” the immediate proximity of the coasts; the
                            protection of the immense extent of Russian coasts in the Pacific Ocean
                            would thus be almost impossible. If the offense had been committed
                            within the limits of the jurisdiction of the local authority, the right
                            to pursue the delinquent still farther could not be ignored. In the case
                            of the Costa Rica packet which is cited quite a different ease is in
                            question, that of the pillage of a canoe abandoned at sea, but having
                            been the object of a pursuit proceeding from the Russian coasts, which
                            excludes all question of violation of the principles of international
                            law.</p>
                        <p>Independently of the preceding considerations, it would be well to note
                            the following particulars of the present case:</p>
                        <p>The question of preservation of fur seals against the destruction to
                            which they are exposed from marauding vessels, either on the high seas
                            or in territorial waters, has been for a long time a matter of
                            solicitude to the Russian Government and the Government of the United
                            States, who are the possessors of the only territory whereon these
                            animals land—on Commander, Pribilof, and Tuleny islands. Great Britain
                            was implicated in this question on the occasion of disputes which arose
                            in consequence of fishery carried on by Canadian vessels. On June 3
                            (15), 1891, the Cabinets of London and Washington agreed to establish a
                            provisory modus vivendi, by virtue of which aliens of both countries
                            were interdicted during the period of one year from engaging in fur-seal
                            fishing in that portion of Bering Sea east of the line of demarcation
                            fixed by the treaty concluded in 1867 between Russia and the United
                            States; that is to say, at a time when the American Government claimed
                            exclusive sovereignty over these parts, founded upon the ancient rights
                            of Russia, acquired at the same time as Alaska and the neighboring
                            islands. This provisory state of things was continued until the decision
                            of the Paris tribunal of arbitration, which passed upon the American
                            claims. (See Review of International Law, Vol. XXV, 1893, p. 417.)</p>
                        <p>As a consequence of the practical application of this measure for the
                            interdiction of seal fishing, there was an extraordinary influx of
                            poaching vessels in the proximity of Russian coasts in the western part
                            of Bering Sea.<note n="a" xml:id="subch3fna">In the documents of the
                                confiscated vessels there were shown inscriptions made by English or
                                American officers ordering these vessels to go beyond the line of
                                demarcation of the forbidden zone, and not to enter again under
                                penalty of confiscation.</note></p>
                        <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0333"/>
                        <p>This circumstance obliged the Russian Government to send a cruiser,
                            furnished with suitable instructions, to the Pacific ocean to protect
                            the fur-seal fisheries. The attitude of the aliens of the party claimant
                            was such as to require Russia to take a stand of legitimate defense. At
                            this time, among other very numerous vessels, both English and Amercan,
                            the schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> was seized for engaging
                            in illegitimate fur-seal fishing off the Commander Islands. Then in the
                            month of May, 1893, a special agreement was concluded between England
                            and. Russia, by which the English Government engaged to temporarily
                            interdict her subjects from seal fishing in a zone of 10 miles along the
                            Russian coasts, along the whole extent of Bering Sea and the western
                            part of the Pacific Ocean, as well as in a zone of 30 miles around the
                            Commander and Tuleny islands. An arrangement of the same nature was
                            concluded on April 22 (May 4), 1894, between Russia and the United
                            States of America. On a parallel with the above facts the Paris tribunal
                            of arbitration of the 15th of April, 1893, settled the difference
                            between England and America, concerning the general question pending
                            between the two Governments, by fixing obligatory rules regarding the
                            protection of seals, by which it was agreed, among other things, that
                            the two countries should completely prohibit their subjects the catching
                            of these animals within the limits of a zone of 60 miles around the
                            Pribilof Islands. This last decision gave partial satisfaction to the
                            claims of the Washington Cabinet. The application of the decisions of
                            the Paris tribunal of arbitration by the two countries was assured, so
                            far as regards England, by means of a bill adopted by Parliament and in
                            America by an act of Congress dated April 5 and 6, 894. In fact, the
                            United States Government showed itself disposed to sign a convention
                            with Russia, England, and Japan on the subject of the extension of the
                            decision of the Paris tribunal of arbitration to all of the waters of
                            the Pacific north of 35° of latitude.</p>
                        <p>Thus it is evident that the points of view of the Russian and American
                            Governments, in a question of such importance for both countries as the
                            preservation of the seals, were, upon the whole, concordant. According
                            to the principle of reciprocity, the United States Government, which
                            claimed the right of control over a great extent of sea, alleging rights
                            in which, according to its own statement, it had taken the place of
                            Russia, and which (Government) availed itself thereof for the protection
                            of its own industry in the territories and waters which belonged to it,
                            was obliged to recognize, on its part, the control of Russia, at least
                            to the limited extent to which the latter proposed to exercise it,
                            without disputing the legality of the measures which the Russian
                            Government thought it necessary to take in order to preserve its own
                            coast against pirates, and without giving its support to the claims of
                            American citizens who infringed upon the regulations adopted by Russia
                            in an interest that was common to both countries. It is incontestable
                            that the Russo-American agreement, concluded after the confiscation of
                            the schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, not having retroactive
                            force, could not, strictly speaking, be applied in the present case; but
                            it is beyond doubt that the agreement only sanctioned in a formal manner
                            the previous point of view in the question of common interest to both
                            countries. Therefore the seizure of an American vessel at a distance of
                            23 miles from the Russian coast, which vessel may have been guilty of
                            infringement upon interests which the Russian Government meant to
                            protect, could not in justice give grounds to claim of the party
                            claimant.</p>

                        <p>By contesting in its entirety, upon the basis of the preceding
                            considerations, the sound basis of the claim of party claimant, the
                            defendant party thinks it necessary to pause at certain points of detail

                            <item>Particular weight should be attached to the personal claims of
                                Captain Furman ($25,000), of his first mate, Ronning ($15,000), and
                                of the fisherman Wolfgang ($10,000); also to the claim presented in
                                the name of the entire crew of the confiscated vessel, which reaches
                                a sum of $20,000. All of these claims, stripped of sufficient proofs
                                to a total of $70,000, with interest for nine years, are based upon
                                the pretended facts which follow: The captain of the American vessel
                                had been compelled by force, under penalty of transportation to
                                Siberia, to sign a document in a foreign language which he did not
                                understand, and to submit to a severe imprisonment on the Russian
                                cruiser. Cruelties were committed against the crew in general,
                                either at sea or on shore, on account of which they must have
                                suffered greatly both physically and mentally. In fact, certain
                                trifling objects belonging to Furman, Ronning, and Wolfgang were
                                lost and were not restored to them when they were given their
                                liberty. Then the inquiry which was made and the decision of the
                                superior authority as to these facts established not only the
                                complete inaneness of these allegations, offensive to the honor of
                                the Russian navy, but still more the fact that many of these aliens
                                at Petropavlovsk expressed their thanks to the Russian officers for
                                the good treatment they received and the assistance that was given
                                them for their return to their own country. (See Exhibit H.) As for
                                the particular point of the argument drawn from the fact that
                                uncomfortable lodgings in the town had been assigned to these
                                parties, it is explained by the insufficiency of the local resources
                                and not from any intention to treat the aforementioned persons as
                                criminals. On the contrary, the Russian authorities renounced all
                                personal judicial action against the parties who aboard the <hi
                                    rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> engaged in illegal fishing,
                                confining itself to confiscating the seized vessel. (Exhibits II and
                                III.) In view of the preceding, the mention made by the party
                                claimant of the precedent of the decision of the Commission of
                                Washington in 1871, where, according to the memorandum, it is a
                                question of the illegal confinement of persons in a prison or in a
                                fortress at the time of the war of secession is not applicable in
                                the present case, and the defendant party believes it right to
                                reject in a manner most emphatic all claims bearing upon personal
                                bad treatment to which the interested parties may have been
                                subjected.</item>

                            <p>On the 3d (15th) July, at 10.30 p.m., being in 54° 30’ latitude north
                                and 167° 15’ longitude east, bearing toward southeast 68, from the
                                port cathead, at a distance of 2 miles, was sighted a sailing vessel
                                without distinctive lights, which bore in the direction west of the
                                southern extremity of the island of Medny. A blank shot fired from a

                                which injunction was at once obeyed. An armed rowboat was sent from
                                the cruiser under command of Lieutenant Panferow, who having
                                superficially examined the hold discovered a number of seal skins,
                                and of five seals but recently killed. Lieutenant Panferow,
                                remaining aboard the schooner, sent her captain with the log book

                                        cook, Julius Furman, were remunerated according to the
                                        number of skins of seals killed. Besides the persons above
                                        mentioned, forming part of the crew and not on the ship’s

                                        seven men were left aboard the cruiser. Lieutenant Panferow,
                                        being sent aboard the schooner, took the towline tendered by
                                        the cruiser and conducted the schooner into the roadstead of

                                p.m., in 54° 30’ latitude north and 167° 15’ longitude east, while
                                sailing in the direction southeast 68, we sighted at a distance of 2
                                miles a sailing vessel without distinctive lights following a course
                                to the west of the southern extremity of the island of Medny. A

                                schooner was enjoined by verbal order to lay to; this she did. Two
                                officers and 11 sailors were sent aboard. On inspection it was
                                discovered that the schooner contained 15 seal skins and 5 seals
                                newly killed, after which a towline was tendered and she was towed
                                to the village of Nicolsk. There was no resistance on the part of

                        <p>The American schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> was detained
                            and afterwards permitted to continue her course under the following
                            circumstances:</p>
                        <p>On the 31st of July (August 12), 1892, at 7 a.m., the Russian naval
                            cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaka</hi>, under command of Captain de
                            Livron, detained off the Medny Island, in Bering Sea, three small boats
                            engaged in poaching, and belonging to the English schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">Sayward</hi>, and afterwards another marauding
                            schooner, the <hi rend="italic">Vancouver Belle</hi>, seeking the <hi
                                rend="italic">Sayward</hi>, which had disappeared, when it sighted
                            through the fog at a short distance still another sailing vessel, which
                            was found to be the American schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and
                                Anna.</hi></p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Zabiaka</hi> detained the latter in her course in
                            54° 9/10’ latitude north and 168° 21/22’ longitude east, 30 miles south
                            of the Commander Islands. From the ship’s papers, which were presented
                            by Captain Lutjens, the commander of the <hi rend="italic">Zabiaka</hi>
                            discovered that the log of the schooner had not been kept for ten days
                            past, and that it was generally not in order. According to the lines of
                            route indicated on the chart of navigation, as also from the points
                            noted at noon, the commander of the <hi rend="italic">Zabiaka</hi> was
                            convinced that the <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>, during the last
                            ten days, had twice entered the strait between the Bering and Medny
                            Islands. Consequently, not trusting to the explanations made by the
                            captain that he had entered the strait on account of bad weather, and
                            believing that he had engaged in illegitimate seal fishing in the
                            proximity of the Russian coasts, Captain de Livron seized the 124
                            sealskins which were aboard the schooner. As he had no more convincing
                            proofs he permitted the schooner to continue her course, after
                            compelling the captain to sign an agreement not to kill seals in Russian
                            waters. This warning was inscribed in the log book of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>, and Captain Lutjens made at that
                            time no further claim. (See Exhibts I and II; compare Memorandum,
                            Exhibit E.)</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">grounds for legal
                            responsibility.</hi></p>
                        <p>There is no doubt, in consideration of the conditions of the encounter
                            with the <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> and from the evidence of
                            her ship’s papers, that the commander of the cruiser <hi rend="italic"
                                >Zabiaka</hi> had serious reasons to suspect this vessel and even to
                            conclude that at least a portion of her catch had been obtained by
                            poaching in Russian territorial waters. However, the setting at liberty
                            of the vessel, after having seized the cargo which rendered it
                            suspicious, shows a lack of purpose in the decision of the naval
                            cruiser’s commander, which might be partly explained by <pb n="314"
                                xml:id="pg_314" facs="0338"/>want of positive proofs of the
                            culpability of Captain Lutjens regarding the wrong attributed to him.
                            Therefore the Russian Government, in conformity with its desire to
                            maintain on all occasions amicable relations with the American
                            Government, is ready to acknowledge its obligation to indemnify the
                            actual losses caused the individual by the lamentable fact concerning
                            the schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>. In view of the
                            preceding there is no reason to enter into an examination of the
                            principle of international law regarding the freedom of the high seas,
                            and the question now is the settlement of the amount of indemnity to be
                            paid to the injured parties for the decision taken at the moment the
                            said vessel was stopped.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">amount of indemnity.</hi></p>
                        <p>All the claims in this affair are filed in the name of the captain, owner
                            of the vessel <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>, Charles Lutjens, who
                            thinks he has the right to claim not only reimbursement of the value of
                            124 confiscated sealskins, but also an indemnity for the interruption of
                            her voyage during the fishing season. The total amount of Lutjens’s
                            claims was limited in 1893 to $10,000; at present, with interest added,
                            it reaches the sum of $16,148.44. (See Memorandum, Exhibits C, H, and
                            statement of case.)</p>
                        <p>I. Regarding the most important portion of the alleged losses, which is
                            estimated at $8,750 and which relates to the interruption of the
                            schooner’s course, the defendant party considers that this feature of
                            the claim is devoid of all juridical grounds. It is plain that in
                            warning the suspected vessel of the legal responsibility it incurred by
                            navigating in Russian waters, the cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaka</hi>
                            did not forbid her to continue fishing outside the aforesaid zone, and
                            did not touch upon the freedom of the further navigation of the schooner
                            upon the high seas, open alike to all. This warning consisted only of a
                            necessary reminder of the obligation not to infringe upon the rights of
                            others, and not a forbidding of the American vessel to exercise her
                            legitimate rights. At all events, the commander of the Russian cruiser
                            had not ordered the captain of the schooner to “stop seal fishing and go
                            home” (as the claimant pretends); confining himself to the confiscation
                            of the sealskins, he inscribed in the schooner’s log, that “the vessel
                            was not taken and got free,” so it appears from the explanations of the
                            claimant himself. Therefore De Livron’s warning to the captain alone did
                            not oblige the schooner to quit at once the western waters of the
                            Pacific and to return to San Francisco. In a word, there could be no
                            question of enforced interruption of the voyage of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Kate and Anna</hi> until the close of the fishing season, or of the
                            loss which the vessel may have sustained of a probable profit derived
                            from legitimate fishing in open sea. Judging superfluous a return to the
                            questions developed in case of <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>
                            (first case) concerning the inapplicability in a civil action of
                            hypothetical calculations as to the number of animals that might have
                            been killed, a quantity estimated in the present case at 625, the
                            defendant party rejects on his part said claim as unfounded.</p>
                        <p>II. Captain Lutjens’s claim for indemnity for 124 sealskins which were
                            confiscated from him is recognized as essentially legitimate, but the
                            amount of the claim upon this point seems exaggerated. To justify the
                            sum of $1,736 claimed to-day, while in 1893 the sum of $1,737 was
                            claimed, reveals the fact that according to the word of the ship’s owner
                                <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0339"/>of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Kate and Anna</hi> (Memorandum, Exhibit G), the 1,252 skins
                            previously delivered to Hakodate that same season were sold on the
                            London market at $14 each. But, independent of this, the fact alleged is
                            not proven in a documentary manner (compare Memorandum, Exhibit Q). It
                            will be seen that the claimant party in his statement cites the case of
                            the valuation of sealskins at $8 each. There also appear data contained
                            in the books of the imperial ministry of marine that, at the time of the
                            sale through an intermediary of the firm of Lindholm at London of
                            sealskins confiscated from different vessels in 1892, sums amounting to
                            15 rubles 61 copeck and 18 rubles 44 copeck each were realized; that is
                            to say, from about $8 to $9.50, valuing the dollar at 1 ruble 95
                            copeck.</p>
                        <p>From the preceding, and considering that the party claimant does not
                            present exact data on the subject of the then price of the raw products
                            on the San Francisco market, that is to say, from the starting point to
                            the destination of the schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>,
                            the defendant party thinks it quite sufficient to take as mean value of
                            one sealskin $10 as a maximum, and declares a willingness to pay for
                            said 124 skins a sum total of $1,240.</p>
                        <p>III. The addition of legal interest, as has been stated above in the
                            counter memorandum, is recognized as just by the defendant party, to
                            date from the day of confiscation of the seal skins in question. In
                            fine, it suffices to say that the compromise recently proposed to fix
                            the indemnity at $7,500 instead of $16,148.44, now claimed, shows a lack
                            of accuracy in the calculations of the party claimant. (Memorandum
                            Exhibits T and U of the first case.)</p>

                        <p>On the basis of all that precedes, the defendant party recognizes the
                            obligation to pay an indemnity amounting to $1,240, with added interest
                            at 6 per cent per annum from the 31st July (August 12), 1892, and
                            requests that the claims of the party claimant upon the other points be

                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Extract from the Report of the
                                    Commander of the Second-Class Cruiser Zabiaka dated August</hi>
                                11, 1892, No. 354.</p>
                            <p>On the 31st of July, being sheltered by the southern extremity of the
                                Medny Island, and off the western coast, I was notified between 12
                                and 1 o’clock by a signal from shore that from the western coast of
                                the island a schooner had been sighted. I at once circled the
                                extremity of the island, and saw at a distance of 3 miles from shore
                                three sails, which disappeared in the distance. On approaching we
                                discovered that they were three poaching vessels, which fled at the
                                approach of the cruiser.</p>
                            <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0340"/>
                            <p>On reaching these boats, which were found to belong to the schooner
                                    <hi rend="italic">Sayward</hi>, I gave orders to seize them. The
                                boats, with nine men, guns, and eight seals just killed, were taken
                                aboard the cruiser and confiscated. The boats and guns were sold at
                                auction in the village of Nicolsk for 200 rubles. At the court of
                                inquiry these aliens declared to me the point at which the schooner
                                lay, at southwest 45°, and I made way thither. Shortly thereafter we
                                sighted the schooner, and at 4.30 we hove to in close proximity to
                                the latter. The captain being requested to report aboard the cruiser
                                with his ship’s papers, presented himself; but I discovered that I
                                had made a mistake. The poachers had misdirected me. This vessel
                                proved to be the English schooner <hi rend="italic">Vancouver
                                    Belle</hi>, commanded by Capt. W. H. Copp, 23 men in crew. There
                                were aboard the schooner nearly 600 seal skins, salt, powder, and
                                arms. I ordered her confiscation, since it developed from her log
                                book that a portion of the seals had been caught in the strait
                                between the islands. I took the captain and crew aboard, and I
                                charged Lieutenant Eoltchak to conduct her to Petropavlovsk.
                                Immediately after the seizure a dense fog gathered, which robbed me
                                of all possibility of discovering the cruiser <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Sayward</hi>. At 6.15 the fog lifted somewhat, and at a short
                                distance I again sighted a schooner in 54° 10’ latitude north and
                                168° 22’ longitude east. The captain being requested to come aboard,
                                presented his papers and his log book.</p>
                            <p>I learned from the log book that the American schooner <hi
                                    rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>, detained by me at considerable
                                distance off the islands, had twice been in the strait between the
                                islands of Bering and Medny; that according to the captain’s word he
                                had passed into the strait on account of the bad weather, and had
                                not caught any seals in Russian waters.</p>
                            <p>There were absolutely no convincing proofs against the schooner;
                                therefore, on account of the irregularities of the log book, I took
                                all the seal skins to the number of 124 and allowed the latter to
                                depart, after giving him warning.</p>

                            <p>Circumstances of the case: On the 31st of July at 6.15, being in 64°
                                10’ latitude north and in 168° 22’ longitude east, we met the
                                sailing schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>. Having
                                detained the schooner, we required the captain to report, with his
                                papers. It was found that the schooner log had not been kept during
                                the past ten days and the ship’s journal in general could afford not
                                the least justification. Moreover, the points indicated on the
                                navigation chart caused me to suspect that the seals had been killed
                                in our waters. For this reason they were confiscated. The captain
                                made no resistance.</p>
                            <p>Decision: On account of the irregularity of the log book I
                                confiscated the seal skins and required the captain to sign

                        arbitration.</p>
                    <p>The party claimant notes that the defendant party recognizes that an
                        indemnity is due in the Cases I and IV; that is to say, the <hi
                            rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Kate and

                        two cases is the amount of indemnity due to party claimant, and furthermore
                        that in justice interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum on the entire
                        sum awarded, from the day these damages were caused to the party claimant
                        until the day of payment of indemnity, is due.</p>
                    <p>The defendant party, in its general reference to the conditions under which
                        the seizure of the vessels in question took place, advances certain
                        statements which relate to negotiations of the United States Government
                        concerning the protection of fur seals in the Pacific Ocean. Whatever may be
                        the bearing of that question upon the seizure of the three other vessels, it
                        can in no way be applied to the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>,
                        which was only engaged in whale fishing in the Sea of Okhotsk and had no
                        thought of seal fishing.</p>
                    <p>It is true that the United States Government entered into negotiations with
                        the Governments of Great Britain and Russia for the purpose of preventing
                        the destruction of seals in the North Pacific Ocean, and to that end
                        proposed to the two Governments the adoption of a temporary modus vivendi,
                        pending the decision of the Paris Tribunal concerning the several questions
                        to be arbitrated between the United States and Great Britain. Unfortunately
                        the Imperial Government found it impossible to unite with the Government of
                        the United States and that of Great Britain in agreeing upon a modus
                        vivendi.</p>
                    <p>Had it done so the three Governments might have acted in unison for the
                        suppresion of fur-seal fishing pending the decision of the Paris
                        tribunal.</p>
                    <p>By the terms of the modus vivendi, which was agreed upon in 1891, each of the
                        contracting parties, the United States and Great Britain, took upon itself
                        to prohibit its respective citizens and subjects from seal fishing in
                        certain waters beyond the ordinary territorial limits pending the decision
                        of the Paris tribunal regarding the limits of the jurisdiction of the United
                        States in those waters. This prohibition of seal fishing in said waters
                        became a temporary municipal law of each of the two powers concerning their
                        respective subjects or citizens, but it should not, and indeed could not, be
                        imposed by either Government upon the citizens of the other. By special
                        agreement the right was <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0344"
                        />respectively conferred upon these Governments each to arrest subjects of
                        the other found violating this municipal law, but with the express
                        stipulation that the persons and vessels thus seized should be handed over
                        to the authorities of the country to which they respectively belong for
                        trial and punishment. At the expiration of this modus vivendi in 1892 a new
                        understanding was arrived at between the two Governments in a revised modus
                        vivendi, by the terms of which it was agreed that if the claims of the
                        United States to an extended jurisdiction in the waters of Bering Sea were
                        not sustained by the tribunal of Paris, the United States Government would
                        indemnify the subjects of Great Britain for abstaining from fur-seal fishing
                        pending the decision of said tribunal, and the amount of such indemnity
                        should be founded on the probable catch which the vessel might have made
                        during that period.</p>
                    <p>Copies of these two conventions are hereunto annexed and submitted in
                        evidence, marked respectively Exhibits “A” and “B,” and reference is made to
                        them, not only as supporting the points herein expressed in reply to the
                        counter-memorandum, but as international conventions bearing directly upon
                        the subject of the present arbitration and in support of the demands of the
                        party claimant, especially as to the question of the loss of time of the
                        seized vessels, and the amount of damage thus sustained through the loss of
                        a probable catch.</p>
                    <p>These special and limited conventions of a purely temporary nature between
                        the Governments of the United States and Great Britain surely can not be
                        interpreted as conferring upon the Government of Russia rights over citizens
                        of the United States and their property which neither of the high
                        contracting parties possesses over the other.</p>
                    <p>If, however, the defendant party takes the ground that this modus vivendi
                        gave it particular rights for the temporary protection of the fur-seal
                        fisheries, according to which it was permitted to seize and punish violators
                        of this municipal law in waters beyond the ordinary maritime jurisdiction,
                        then it can not escape the obligations imposed upon the United States in the
                        modus vivendi of 1892 to indemnify for losses in case the Paris tribunal
                        should decide, as it did, that no country possesses territorial rights in
                        Bering Sea beyond the limits of ordinary maritime jurisdiction. The modus
                        vivendi, nevertheless, while it accorded certain rights and privileges,
                        imposed also certain responsibilities, and the defendant party can not now,
                        after refusing to unite with the other high contracting parties and to share
                        the responsibilities, claim to-day rights and privileges which would exceed
                        those enjoyed by the contracting parties themselves.</p>
                    <p>The quotation from the modus vivendi was made by the defendant party as being
                        applicable in the case of the present arbitration, but the party claimant
                        protests against the application of this special and private convention
                        between two contracting parties as a rule of conduct for a third party
                        unless it be accepted in its entirety. Therefore if the modus vivendi is
                        really applicable as a rule of conduct for the defendant party, it was
                        obliged on seizing the vessels, the cargoes, and the crews to hand them over
                        to the United States Government as soon as practically possible, and in
                        default of having done so—depriving these citizens of the United States of
                        their interest in the use of their property and preventing the officers and
                        crew from making their living in their own way, according to the very spirit
                        of the modus vivendi—the defendant party becomes responsible for the loss
                        occasioned <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0345"/>these claimants,
                        measured by a just estimate of the probable catch of the vessels in
                        question.</p>
                    <p>As for the last modus vivendi, which the defendant party cites as being
                        applicable to these cases, the party claimant protests against the
                        consideration of this citation. The terms of the protocol deny specifically
                        all retroactive force, and recourse may not be had to this modus vivendi to
                        justify these seizures made by another party before its existence.</p>
                    <p>One head of damages set up by the party claimant which relates to all of the
                        four cases of this arbitration, and the justice of which the defendant party
                        vigorously disputes, is that of the loss of catch.</p>
                    <p>Many precedents have been cited by the party claimant in support of this
                        claim, but the modus vivendi of 1892, which the defendant party cites as
                        relating to the present arbitration, gives still more force to the argument
                        of the party claimant that the loss of the catch is the true measure of
                        damage for loss of service of the seized vessel. Article V of this
                        convention says specifically that if the decision of the tribunal should be
                        adverse to the claims of jurisdiction advanced by the United States as to
                        the extent of said jurisdiction over the waters of Bering Sea the latter
                        shall indemnify the subjects of Great Britain for abstaining from the
                        exercise of their right to engage in seal fishing in these waters, measured
                        by the catch which said subjects might have made.</p>
                    <p>The defendant party, according to the argument contained in its counter
                        memorandum in the case of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>,
                        admits the loss of profits as measure for damages for the loss of service of
                        the vessel, but expresses the opinion that “this last should be taken in the
                        sense of deprivation of a determined income, or else of a certain profit to
                        be derived from holdings in question. For instance, in the case of
                        appropriating the property of another, or of damages occasioned a vessel
                        laden and on the point of departure” continuing, that the case in question
                        is an enterprise subject to risks which might result in the loss of the
                        property of the participants. The party claimant maintain that such
                        distinctions have not the least bearing upon the obligation of the defendant
                        party to make restitutio in integrum for the illegal detention of the
                        citizens and vessels of the party claimant. To deprive a person of the use
                        of his property, which represents to him the tool of the workman, and to
                        deprive him of the use of it in his legitimate business does, according to
                        all principles of equity, give him the right to indemnity for such
                        deprivation of his property. The profits which he could reasonably expect
                        from the use specified is the sole measure of damage sustained by him in the
                        deprivation of his property. The question of possible risk or danger of the
                        enterprise has no bearing on the responsibilities incurred by interruption
                        or by seizure. The possibility of losses enters into all commercial
                        enterprises, and above all in navigation at sea. The vessel laden and ready
                        to go to sea is quite as liable to disaster at sea as the one awaiting a
                        cargo, and all hope of profit in commercial enterprises may prove deceptive.
                        The two enterprises, whaling and sealing, are recognized as legitimate, for
                        which there is always capital to be invested, and the interruption of these
                        enterprises has been admitted in international arbitrations as a subject for
                        indemnification on the basis of the loss of catch, as has been cited in the
                        memorandum of the party claimant, namely, in the decision of the “Alabama
                        claims,” in the arbitration of the claims of Great <pb n="322"
                            xml:id="pg_322" facs="0346"/>Britain against the United States for
                        seizures made in Bering Sea, and in the sentence of the arbitrator in the
                        case of <hi rend="italic">Costa Rica Packet.</hi></p>
                    <p>The defendant party cited the decision of the arbitration tribunal on the
                        cases known as the “Alabama claims” as establishing the principle of not
                        allowing indemnity for claims for indirect damages. The indirect damages
                        excluded by the tribunal at Geneva in adjudication of the “Alabama claims”
                        were the loss in the transfer of the American merchant marine to the English
                        flag: additional payments for insurance; the prolongation of the war; and
                        the addition of a large sum to the expense of the war, and the suppression
                        of the rebellion.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, in the case of the whalers <hi rend="italic">James Maury,
                            General Pike, Milo</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Nile</hi>, seized by the
                        Confederate States cruiser <hi rend="italic">Shenandoah</hi>, for whose acts
                        the Tribunal of Geneva found Great Britain responsible, damages specifically
                        stated to be in lieu of loss of catch were allowed by the Court of Claims.
                        The decision of the court in these four cases has been cited in the
                        memorandum.</p>
                    <p>The amount of claims submitted by the Government of Great Britain for the
                        seizure by Russia of the Canadian schooners <hi rend="italic">Willie
                            Magowan</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ariel</hi>, cited by the defendant
                        party, has no bearing whatever on the question of amount of damages
                        preferred here. That the English Government claimed and received or did not
                        claim and did receive all of the indemnity for these seizures to which it
                        was entitled can in no way affect the justice of the claims here presented
                        nor furnish a precedent in the adjudication. These negotiations constitute a
                        private agreement between the Governments of Russia and Great Britain.</p>
                    <p>The indemnity here claimed for loss of the catch is not in the nature of
                        future benefits, but for the loss of the use of their property and the means
                        of livelihood of which these claimants were deprived. They are entitled to
                        restitutio in integrum. This could only be accomplished by restoring their
                        property and their rights at the time and place of the seizure or in
                        allowing them a compensation for the deprivation to which they were
                        subjected. The latter is the only means to which it is now possible to
                        resort. The measure of damages suffered through such deprivations can only
                        be estimated upon the basis of the profit which the claimants could expect
                        from the business they were engaged in.</p>
                    <p>One principle of the claim common to the three cases is that for the seizure
                        and detention of the officers and crew of the vessels, and the bad treatment
                        experienced by them, the estimate of which the defendant party finds
                        excessive.</p>
                    <p>In further support of these claims, the party claimant submits the official
                        report of the correspondence and of the action of the United States in the
                        case of the arrest of the Russian subject, Gustav Isaak Dahlberg, master of
                        the bark <hi rend="italic">Hans</hi>, hereunto annexed and marked Exhibits
                        “C” and “D,” respectively.</p>
                    <p>Dahlberg was arrested and detained five days and, when it was demonstrated
                        that his arrest was not legal, the United States Government paid him an
                        indemnity of $5,000, which sum was proposed by the Russian Government as
                        being satisfactory. This will demonstrate that the sums claimed under this
                        head by the parties interested in the present arbitration are far from being
                        exaggerated.</p>
                    <p>In each case of the present arbitration the defendant party has cited in the
                        counter-memorandum the note of the United States ambassador dated January 27
                        (February 8), 1899 (Exhibit T of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn <pb n="323"
                                xml:id="pg_323" facs="0347"/>Pigeon</hi>), in which, in the hope of
                        settling these cases promptly terms of compromise settlement were proposed
                        by the United States.</p>
                    <p>For the purpose of discrediting the bonus fides of these claims, the
                        defendant party in making this citation in each case draws a comparison
                        between the sums proposed by way of compromise without adding the interest,
                        which naturally would be due at the time of settlement, and the amounts of
                        the claims as they are at present shown, with interest added.</p>
                    <p>The party claimant protests against the citation or the consideration of the
                        offer of settlement in such manner. The party claimant has entirely and
                        specifically safeguarded all possible interpretation of abandonment of his
                        rights to recover the entire amount of the claims.</p>
                    <p>The offer was made for a distinct and specific purpose, and not having been
                        accepted by the defendant party, it can not now be cited as affecting in any
                        way whatsoever the amount of indemnity to be recovered.</p>
                    <p>The counter-memorandum being, according to the terms of the protocol, the
                        only argument of the defendant party to which the party claimant is
                        permitted to reply, should be understood as representing all the defense of
                        the defendant party except in that which concerns the argument on the
                        present rejoinder of the party claimant, and therefore, as it is not open to
                        the party claimant to rebrat new testimony or to refute the application of
                        new citations or of new arguments on the memorandum, the party claimant
                        respectfully submits to the honorable arbitrator that no new testimony or
                        arguments on the part of the defendant party should be admitted in the
                        arbitration except to rebut the new facts, arguments, and citations
                        contained in the present rejoinder.</p>

                        <p>The undersigned, Secretary of State, has the honor to submit for
                            transmission to Congress, if deemed proper, a memorial of the claim of
                            Gustav Isak Dahlberg, a Russian subject, master and principal owner of
                            the Russian bark <hi rend="italic">Hans</hi>, based on his wrongful and

                            district court for the southern district of Mississippi.</p>
                        <p>The facts of the case appear to be that the complainant was arrested on
                            board his vessel, then lying off Ship Island, Mississippi, in the early
                            morning of February 10, 1896, by a United States deputy marshal,
                            provided with a warrant issued by the deputy clerk of the United States
                            district court for the southern district of Mississippi, at the suit of
                            one Perttison, a member of the crew of said vessel, the said warrant
                            haying been issued in violation of the provisions of Article VIII of the
                            treaty of December 18, 1832, between the United States and Russia, which
                            stipulates that the consular officers of the contracting parties shall
                            have jurisdiction over disputes between the master of a vessel and the
                            members of his crew.</p>
                        <p>The captain was taken by the marshal to Mississippi City and there
                            confined in a dirty jail, in company with criminals, from February 10 to
                            February 15, inclusive.</p>
                        <p>He protested against the unlawfulness of his detention, and demanded a
                            hearing before a judicial officer, but he was given no opportunity of
                            having the lawfulness of his imprisonment examined into until the
                            Russian consular officer at Mobile, Ala., intervened, and, having
                            employed legal counsel, obtained, on February 14, a writ of habeas
                            corpus in his behalf, returnable on the 17th of the same month.</p>
                        <p>On the day after the issue of the writ, and before the case could be
                            heard, the jailor informed Captain Dahlberg that he was free and could
                            leave the jail, but furnished him with no explanation either of his
                            imprisonment or his release.</p>
                        <p>The complainant then went to Mobile for consultation with the consular
                            officer of his nation. He alleges further that, having appeared with his
                            counsel at Mississippi City on the 17th of February, the return day of
                            the writ of habeas corpus, and also the return day of the warrant of
                            arrest, just as he was about to enter court with his counsel, they met
                            the judge from whose court the warrant had issued, and that the said
                            judge stated to him that there was no case against him. That he then
                            asked, “Is that all the redress I am to get?” to which the judge
                            replied, “I already decided Saturday that there was no case.”</p>
                        <p>The complainant states that, in addition to the physical suffering,
                            discomfort, and humiliation caused by his arrest and imprisonment, he
                            was subjected to considerable expense in attempting to obtain his
                            release; that he was unable to return with his ship; that the ship was
                            delayed for several days because of his arrest, and that, in consequence
                            of these facts, he has suffered considerable pecuniary damages.</p>
                        <p>The case was referred to the Department of Justice for investigation,
                            and, on May 20, 1896, the Acting Attorney-General reported to this
                            Department that “the arrest and imprisonment and detention of Captain
                            Dahlberg were altogether without authority of law.”</p>
                        <p>In view of this opinion of the Department of Justice, and of the appeal
                            made to the sense of justice existing in the Government of the United
                            States, I have the honor to recommend that the case be submitted to
                            Congress, and that body be requested to appropriate the sum of $5,000,
                            to be paid to the Russian diplomatic representative in this capital, in
                            full satisfaction of losses and damages incurred by Captain Dahlberg and
                            the owners of the said Russian bark <hi rend="italic">Hans</hi>, by

                    <p>The petition of Gustaf Isak Dahlberg, subject of His Majesty the Emperor of
                        all the Russias, respectfully represents to your excellency that he was born
                        at Ulaborg, in the grand duchy of Finland, in the year 1855, and that for
                        twenty-eight years he has been a seaman, since 1879 being the——of a vessel.
                        That the Captain Dahlberg who, in 1867, rescued the crew of the American
                        ship <hi rend="italic">Toscana</hi> in North American ocean was deponent’s
                        father.</p>
                    <p>That about the 15th day of October, 1895, the deponent sailed from Cardiff,
                        in Great Britain, as commander of the Russian bark <hi rend="italic"
                            >Hans</hi>, of which bark he is also the principal owner. The <hi
                            rend="italic">Hans</hi> was bound for Mobile Bay, Alabama, for orders,
                        and outside of Mobile Bay received orders to proceed to Ship Island to load
                        cargo, from whence she was to return to Europe with such cargo.</p>
                    <p>That on the 3d day of December, 1895, deponent arrived at the anchorage of
                        Ship Island, in the State of Mississippi, where the vessel anchored. At
                        about 1 a.m. in the morning of February 10, 1896, a United States marshal
                        boarded the said bark <hi rend="italic">Hans</hi> and placed deponent under
                        arrest, showing him at the same time, but not leaving with him, the original
                        nor a copy thereof, although deponent requested that the warrant be left
                        with him.</p>
                    <p>That the said deputy marshal thereupon compelled the deponent to leave his
                        ship and to accompany him, although the deponent protested against the
                        arrest as unjust and illegal; but he, however, made no resistance, and was
                        taken by the said deputy marshal to Biloxi, a distance of some 23 miles from
                        his ship, and was from there transported to Mississippi City, where he
                        arrived about 7 p.m. on the 10th of February, 1896.</p>
                    <p>That upon arriving at Mississippi City deponent was confined in a loathsome
                        and filthy jail, in company with criminals, and subjected to much discomfort
                        and suffering. That through the whole period of his confinement, extending
                        from the 10th day of February to the 15th day of February, 1896, deponent
                        continually protested that his detention was illegal, unlawful, and without
                        jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>He also demanded that he should be brought without delay before some judge or
                        magistrate for an immediate hearing.</p>
                    <p>The deponent further states that, in answer to his repeated protests and his
                        reiterated demands to be brought before a magistrate, he was asked to give a
                        bond in the sum of $1,000. This deponent was not in a position to furnish
                        such a bond as was required of him as a condition for his restoration to
                        liberty, and protested that he was innocent of any wrong, and his detention
                        and the exaction of such bond entirely unlawful and without jurisdiction. He
                        insisted upon having an immediate hearing, or at least being given an
                        opportunity of going before a magistrate or judge of the United States. Upon
                        the 12th day of February, 1896, deponent communicated with the Russian
                        consul at Mobile, asking for protection, and through his good offices he
                        obtained counsel.</p>
                    <p>That the said counsel immediately prepared a petition for a writ of habeas
                        corpus, to wit, on the 14th day of February, but owing to the illness of the
                        judge the hearing upon said writ was postponed by said judge to the 17th
                        instant; that on the 15th day of February, at about the hour of 10.30 a.m.,
                        the jailer came to deponent, who was confined in a cell, and informed him
                        that he was free and could leave the jail, <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329"
                            facs="0353"/>without furnishing any further explanation of his
                        incarceration or its pretext. Deponent then immediately went to Mobile and
                        communicated with the Russian consul at that place, Mr. Murray Wheeler. On
                        the 17th, the day fixed for the hearing on his writ of habeas corpus, as
                        well as the return day of the warrant of arrest as to him, he returned to
                        Mississippi City with his counsel and with witnesses, in readiness for the
                        argument on said writ of habeas corpus and for the trial of any pending
                        question, though protesting against the jurisdiction of the court in the
                        premises.</p>
                    <p>That as the deponent was about to enter the said court-house with his counsel
                        they were met by the United States judge by whom the warrant of arrest
                        against deponent had been issued and before whom the writ of habeas corpus
                        was returnable, and the said judge stated to deponent that “there was no
                        case” against him. Deponent then asked him, “Is that all the redress I am to
                        get?” to which the judge replied, “I already decided on Saturday that there
                        was no case.”</p>
                    <p>Deponent further alleges that at the time of his arrest by the United States
                        deputy marshal on board his bark <hi rend="italic">Hans</hi>, upon the 10th
                        of February, he was shown the warrant, but not the complaint upon which the
                        warrant was obtained; that the said warrant, as appears from the copy hereto
                        annexed, was stated to have been obtained by one H. Perttison, who was
                        alleged to have commenced a civil and maritime action for damages against
                        deponent for assault, although deponent’s recollection of the warrant
                        exhibited to him is that it referred to a complaint for “wages, damages, and
                        hitting.”</p>
                    <p>That it was not until after his confinement and through the efforts of his
                        counsel, Mr. Noland, that deponent was finally able to obtain a copy of the
                        complaint made by such Perttison, upon which the warrant was issued, a copy
                        of which complaint is hereto annexed.</p>
                    <p>That according to the said complaint this was a mere civil action for
                        damages, and not a proceeding of a criminal nature. While deponent denies
                        that he was guilty of the ill treatment of said Perttison as alleged in the
                        said complaint, and while he further states, and as appears from the records
                        of the ship’s log, that the said Perttison was guilty of a breach of
                        contract in that he having shipped in Cardiff for a voyage and refused to
                        work on board ship lying at Ship Island anchorage, yet deponent believes
                        these matters to be immaterial by reason of the fact that his arrest and
                        subsequent imprisonment was illegal and contrary to the laws of the United
                        States, completely without jurisdiction, and was in violation of the treaty
                        existing between the United States of America and the Emperor of Russia,
                        proclaimed May 11, 1833, of which the following is an extract:</p>
                    <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Article VIII</hi>. * * * The consuls, vice-consuls, and
                        commercial agents shall have the right, as such, to sit as judges and
                        arbitrators in such differences as may arise between the captains and crews
                        of the vessels belonging to the nation whose interests are committed to
                        their charge, without the interference of the local authorities, unless the
                        conduct of the crews or of the captain should disturb the order or the
                        tranquillity of the country, or the said consuls, vice-consuls, or
                        commercial agents should require their assistance to cause their decisions
                        to be carried into effect or supported. It is, however, understood that this
                        species of judgment or arbitration shall not deprive the contending parties
                        of the right they have to resort, on their return, to the judicial authority
                        of their country.”</p>
                    <p>That in addition to the physical suffering, discomfort, and humiliation
                        undergone by deponent he was subjected to considerable expense in attempting
                        to obtain his release, and that further he was unable to return with his
                        ship, and that the ship was delayed for several days because of deponent’s
                        arrest, and therefore has suffered considerable pecuniary damages in
                        consequence of these facts. Deponent claims that the illegality of the
                        arrest consisted in— <list>
                            <item>First. That under the treaty between the United States of America
                                and the Empire of Russia, made and proclaimed on the 11th day of
                                May, 1833, all controversies between a Russian master and members of
                                his Russian crew upon a Russian vessel are to be settled before the
                                consular courts of the Empire of Russia.</item>
                            <item>Second. That the courts of the United States have no jurisdiction
                                over civil controversies arising between Russian subjects upon a
                                Russian vessel, and that the action of the United States judge in
                                ordering the arrest of deponent was entirely without jurisdiction, a
                                usurpation of authority, null and void.</item>
                            <item>Third. That the proceedings were contrary to and in violation of
                                the admiralty rules and laws of the United States.</item>
                            <item>Fourth. That the procedure in the case was irregular and contrary
                                to law.</item>
                            <item>Fifth. That the imprisonment was contrary to the constitution and
                                statutes of the State of Mississippi.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Wherefore deponent claims that he has suffered damages and injury to his
                        person and character by the unauthorized act of the United States judge in
                        ordering his <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0354"/>arrest and of the
                        United States deputy marshal by actually putting him in confinement, and he

                        vindication of the rights of one of His Majesty’s subjects, will claim
                        redress and indemnity from the Government of the United States.</p>

                            night of February 12, 1896, at the request of Murray Wheeler, esq.,
                            Russian vice-consul at Mobile, Ala., and afterwards on same night being
                            retained by Captain Dahlberg to take steps for his release from
                            imprisonment in the said jail. At the time aforesaid I accompanied Mr.
                            Wheeler to the said jail and was there introduced to Captain Dahlberg,
                            who was then confined and restrained within the walls of the jail.
                            Captain Dahlberg made a statement to Mr. Wheeler and myself of the
                            circumstances of his arrest on board his ship, and his transportation
                            thence to his then present quarters by Mr. E. Sugden, United States
                            deputy marshal, etc. On examination next day of the papers in this case,
                            in the office of the clerk of the court, I resolved to institute habeas
                            corpus proceedings in behalf of Captain Dahlberg. I prepared the
                            necessary papers therefor, and in the afternoon of the 14th February I
                            presented the same to Hon. H. C. Niles, judge of the court, etc., who
                            only a few hours before had arrived at Mississippi City.</p>
                        <p>Judge Niles, who was then quite unwell, informed me that he could not
                            bear this matter until Monday, that being the 17th of February. On the
                            morning of the 15th February, Mr. Meriwether, the proctor of record of
                            the libellant in the cause, came to me and said that he was going to
                            instruct Mr. Sugden, the deputy marshal, to release Captain Dahlberg
                            from the jail, and then proceeded to the direction of Mr. Sugden’s
                            residence. Very soon thereafter, while I was conferring with Captain
                            Dahlberg in jail, the turnkey of the jail came in and announced to
                            Captain Dahlberg that he was released. This was done, as I understood at
                            the time, by the direction and order of the said deputy marshal. Captain
                            Dahlberg then being at liberty, no further steps were needed or taken
                            regarding the habeas corpus proceedings.</p>

                                    11th day of December, 1895, the said G. I. Dahlberg, at Ship
                                    Island Harbor, cruelly assaulted, beat, wounded, and illtreated
                                    libelant for no other reason than that libelant, in answer to a
                                    question put by a professional diver, told how much the bark
                                    leaked.</item>
                                <item>Third. That on the 13th of December, 1895, while libelant was
                                    sick in bed, he asked the said master for permission to go to
                                    the hospital; that the said master, pretending to feel
                                    libelant’s pulse, seized him roughly by the wrist with one hand
                                    while with the other he seized libelant by the throat and
                                    dragged him out of bed, breaking down the bed. The said master
                                    then ordered libelant to follow him to the deck, which order
                                    libelant obeyed, when said master again cruelly beat and ill
                                    used libelant. Libelant asked permission to see the Russian
                                    consul, and the master replied that he was the consul and the
                                    king, and that he would whip him as much as he pleased, and that
                                    any of the seamen may whip him and that nothing would be heard
                                    of it. The master then told libelant that he was a prisoner and
                                    refused to give him anything to eat, and threatened to punish
                                    any of the seamen if they should give him anything to eat; that
                                    said cruel treatment was continued by said master until on or
                                    about the 24th of January, 1896, when libelant asked the said
                                    master for his wages and for permission to go ashore. The master
                                    told him to go, but refused to pay him his wages.</item>
                                <item>That all and singular the premises are true and within the
                                    admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and

                                <item>Fourth. That by reason of the wanton cruelty and unlawful
                                    violence to which the libelant has been subjected by the said
                                    master, as hereinbefore alleged and set forth, the libelant has
                                    suffered great pain, distress, and he has been damaged to the
                                    amount of $5,000.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Wherefore the libelant prays that a warrant of arrest, in due form of law
                            according to the course of this honorable court in cases of admiralty
                            and maritime jurisdiction, maybe issued against the said G. I. Dahlberg,
                            and that he may be cited to appear and answer all and singular the
                            matters aforesaid before this honorable court on the 17th day of
                            February, 1896, at Mississippi City, then and there to answer the
                            libelant in the premises, and that this honorable court would be pleased
                            to decree to the libelant the payment of the said amount due to libelant
                            in a cause of damage, civil and maritime, aforesaid, with interest and
                            costs, and that the libelant may have such other and further relief as
                            in law and justice he may be entitled to receive.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In reply to your request for a statement
                            concerning the imprisonment of Captain Dahlberg in the jail of my
                            county, I beg leave to state that the Captain was <pb n="336"
                                xml:id="pg_336" facs="0360"/>brought to my jail on the night of
                            February 10 by Mr. E. Sugden, deputy United States marshal, and assigned
                            to the lower story of the jail, the compartment kept exclusively for
                            white prisoners. He was furnished with a mattress and clean and ample
                            bedding. The Captain’s statement that the jail was filthy and unclean is
                            false. The jail is examined by the members of the board of supervisors
                            each month, and their testimony will bear me out in the assertion that
                            the jail was always well kept and clean.</p>
                        <p>The criminals the Captain speaks of consisted of one Sam McKinnis,
                            charged with running a “blind tiger,” and, like the Captain, had failed
                            to furnish a bond, and a young man named John Miller, who was serving
                            out a sentence of thirty days for stealing a bicycle. These are the
                            “criminals” in whose company he was placed.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I beg to say that the Captain never at any time during his
                            imprisonment complained of the condition of the jail or the treatment
                            received. The Captain was released from my jail by order of Mr. Sugden,
                            deputy United States marshal.</p>

                            instant, state on the 8th day of February, 1896, a warrant of arrest for
                            G. I. Dahlberg was issued by the clerk and executed by me on the 10th
                            instant, on board the bark <hi rend="italic">Hans</hi>, lying at Ship
                            Island. I urged the Captain to make bond, and proposed to go with him to
                            any point in my district for that purpose, which offer was refused. When
                            we landed at Biloxi, the Captain had a conversation with Mr. F. W.
                            Elmer, deputy collector of customs, who advised him to make bail.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. John E. Johnson and H. C. James offered to make the bond, and
                            advised him to accept it and not to go to jail, but the Captain insisted
                            on being locked up. He was brought to Mississippi City and delivered to
                            the jailor on the night of the 10th, and was released on the morning of
                            the 15th by instruction of the plaintiff’s attorney. In conclusion, the
                            Captain was treated with the utmost courtesy, as a number of reputable
                            persons will testify.</p>

                            respectfully make the following statement and explanation:</p>
                        <p>On the 8th day of February, 1896, a libel in personam was filed in
                            admiralty by H. M. A. Perttison against G. I. Dahlberg, captain of the
                            Russian bark <hi rend="italic">Hans</hi>. After consideration of the
                            matter, having knowledge of the fact that Ship Island was wholly without
                            both the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the State of Mississippi,
                            jurisdiction both civil and criminal having been ceded to the United
                            States by act of legislature in 1858 (which fact disposed of the
                            “imprisonment for debt” feature), and that the rules in admiralty
                            especially prescribed that suits for damages for assaults must be
                            brought in personam only; that the assault was committed at Ship Island,
                            within the jurisdiction of the United States, and, lastly, the fact that
                            the libelant was no longer attached to the vessel but had been
                            discharged by Captain Dalhberg, in my opinion put the matter outside of
                            treaty stipulations.</p>
                        <p>I filed the libel and issued the warrant of arrest, as prayed for by the
                            rules in admiralty.</p>
                        <p>I delivered the warrant of arrest to Mr. E. Sugden, United States deputy
                            marshal, who proceeded to execute it. Of course I have no personal
                            knowledge of what transpired from the time Mr. Sugden left here until
                            his return, but I have been told <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0361"
                            />by reliable parties that Captain Dahlberg was treated with great
                            consideration by Mr. Sugden and was repeatedly requested by Mr. Sugden
                            to give bail for his appearance on the 17th and save him (Sugden) the
                            disagreeable duty of putting him in jail, but this he emphatically
                            refused to do. Mr. H. C. James and several other gentlemen voluntarily
                            offered to sign an appearance bond for the Captain, but he refused their
                            offers. The Captain simply courted imprisonment.</p>
                        <p>After being incarcerated the Captain acted like a maniac, making all
                            sorts of threats, etc., and finally the jailer asked me to go over and
                            talk to him. I did so, and was spoken to very harshly by the Captain
                            after I had offered to do anything in my power to assist him in getting
                            bail. Told him I would assume the responsibility of sending some one
                            with him (the deputy marshal having gone away to serve a writ) to any
                            point in the district to enable him to give bail, and his answer was
                            that he could give bond easily in either Scranton or Biloxi, but that he
                            would not do so, but demanded his unconditional release. This, I told
                            him, was out of my power, and I left him talking in a loud and excited
                            manner.</p>
                        <p>As for the jail being filthy, that is false. He was placed in the lower
                            part of the jail, which is reserved for white persons only and which is
                            always kept clean, and the criminals he complains of being confined with
                            consisted of a white man who, like himself, was there in default of bail
                            for stealing a bicycle. The jailer’s mother took a mattress with clean
                            and ample bedding from the residence portion of the jail and furnished
                            it to the Captain.</p>
                        <p>I am entirely ignorant of any habeas corpus proceedings.</p>
                        <p>On February 18 a motion was filed by libelant’s proctor, praying leave to
                            amend the libel, which was granted, and on same day a citation
                            issued.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I wish to say that I certainly acted without malice in the
                            matter, but simply did what I thought the law required me to do, and
                            have had no reason so far to change my opinion, although libelant has
                            changed his mode of procedure.</p>
                        <p>If I have made a mistake I am, of course, sorry that it occurred, and can
                            only say that it was an error of judgment. I inclose copies of the
                            different papers referred to.</p>
                        <p>Hoping that the foregoing will cover the information desired,</p>
                        <p>I remain yours, very respectfully,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your letter in reference to the arrest and
                            imprisonment of G. I. Dahlberg received.</p>
                        <p>You will notice that the warrant of arrest was issued by the clerk of the
                            United States court at Mississippi City upon the complaint of Perttison,
                            and commands the marshal to arrest the defendant. The writ contains no
                            notice that the defendant or the libellant is either a Russian subject,
                            and Deputy United States Marshal Sugden proceeded to execute the writ as
                            commanded. By act of the legislature of Mississippi in 1858 the island
                            of Ship Island and adjacent waters was ceded to the United States. The
                            State of Mississippi in 1844 abolished imprisonment for debt, but the
                            locus of the arrest being beyond the jurisdiction of the State court,
                            the State statutes had no application, as the island and its waters are
                            exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Federal court. There is no
                            general statute of the United States repealing imprisonment for debt
                            that I have found, only in reference to those States which have
                            abolished such imprisonment by statute.</p>
                        <p>In relation to the treaty stipulations between the United States and the
                            Russian Government, I will say that none of the officers of the southern
                            district of Mississippi were advised. This is evidenced by the fact
                            disclosed by the records that the presiding judge allowed the libelant
                            to amend his pleadings and ordered a citation to issue, as in civil
                            proceedings in admiralty in ordinary cases. The deputy marshal having no
                            notice that the defendant, Dahlberg, was a Russian subject, and the writ
                            having been issued under lawful authority, believed it to be his duty
                            and that he was compelled to serve the writ according to its
                            commandments.</p>
                        <p>There was no illtreatment of the defendant, and the deputy, as shown by
                            his returns, urged the defendant to give his appearance bond, which he
                            declined to do.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of
                        your letter of April 10 replying to mine of March 17 last in regard to the
                        arrest and imprisonment of Captain Dahlberg, master of the Russian bark <hi
                            rend="italic">Hans</hi>, by officers of the United States district court
                        for the southern district of Mississippi.</p>
                    <p>The complaint of the Russian Government in behalf of Captain Dahlberg was
                        that on February 10, 1896, a United States deputy marshal boarded the bark
                            <hi rend="italic">Hans</hi> and arrested Captain Dahlberg; that the
                        marshal took Captain Dahlberg to Mississippi City and there confined him in
                        a loathsome and filthy jail in company with criminals, and subjected him to
                        much discomfort and suffering; that throughout the whole period of his
                        confinement, extending from February 10 to February 15, Dalhberg protested
                        against the unlawfulness of his detention and demanded a hearing before a
                        judicial officer; that a bail bond of $1,000 was demanded of him as a
                        condition of his temporary release; that he was given no opportunity to have
                        the lawfulness of his imprisonment inquired into until the Russian consul at
                        Mobile, Ala., intervened and obtained on February 14 a writ of habeas
                        corpus, returnable on the 17th of that month; that on the 15th of
                        February—one day after the writ of habeas corpus had been obtained and two
                        days before the time set for the bearing—the jailer informed Captain
                        Dahlberg that he was free and could leave the jail, without furnishing any
                        explanation of his imprisonment or of his release.</p>
                    <p>Your letter incloses what purports to be a copy of the court record of the
                        proceedings against Captain Dahlberg. In this record it appears that on the
                        4th of February, one Perttisen, a seaman of the bark <hi rend="italic"
                            >Hans</hi>, brought a suit in the district court against Captain
                        Dahlberg for damages, based on allegations of assault and cruel treatment,
                        and in the said libel prayed: “That a warrant of arrest in due form of law,
                        according to the course of this honorable court in cases of admiralty and
                        maritime jurisdiction, may be issued against the said G. I. Dahlberg;” that
                        in pursuance of this libel and prayer a warrant for Dahlberg’s arrest was
                        issued on February 8 by the clerk of the court; that by the marshal’s return
                        on this warrant it was “executed by arresting the within-named G. I.
                        Dahlberg and transporting him to Mississippi City and confining him in jail
                        in default of bond, which he refuses to give this 10th day of February, A.
                        D. 1896;” that on 18th of February the libellant moved to amend his libel by
                        substituting a prayer for a citation in lieu of the prayer for the
                        defendant’s arrest made in the original; that on the same day a citation was
                        issued to the defendant, Dahlberg, admonishing him to appear before the
                        district court on the 2d day of March to answer the said libel, upon which
                        the marshal’s return was “after diligent search not found in my district.
                        This 2d day of March A. D. 1896.”</p>
                    <p>The record does not show when or how Captain Dahlberg was released from
                        imprisonment. The release does not appear to have been made by any judicial
                        or formal order. It does not appear of record that he was released at
                        all.</p>
                    <p>In view of these facts, I have the honor to request that you will consider
                        whether Captain Dahlberg was unlawfully imprisoned by the authorities of the
                        United States district court for the southern district of Mississippi, with
                        special reference (1) to the laws which govern the procedure of that court,
                        and (2) to the rights of Captain Dahlberg as master of a Russian vessel
                        under the treaty of December 18, 1832, between the United States and Russia,
                        Article VIII of which provides that “The consuls, vice-consuls, and
                        commercial agents shall have the right, as such, to sit as judges and
                        arbitrators in such differences as may arise between the captains and crews
                        of the vessels belonging to the nation whose interests are committed to
                        their charge <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0363"/>without the
                        interference of the local authorities, unless the conduct of the crews or of
                        the captain should disturb the order or tranquillity of the country, or the
                        said consuls, vice-consuls, or commercial agents should require their
                        assistance to cause their decisions to be carried into effect or supported.
                        It is, however, understood that this species of judgment or arbitration
                        shall not deprive the contending parties of the right they have to resort,
                        on their return, to the judicial authority of their country.”</p>
                    <p>If you should arrive at the conclusion that this complainant was unlawfully
                        imprisoned, I should be glad to have a suggestion from you which I may use
                        in replying to his Government as to the legal practicability of his
                        obtaining redress in the courts of the United States. As the law now stands
                        he can not bring suit against the Government for alleged tortious
                        misfeasance of an officer of the Government. If the sureties of the officers
                        concerned in the arrest and imprisonment are liable in case the arrest and
                        imprisonment were unlawful, I should be glad to know it.</p>

                        reference to the laws which govern the procedure of that court, and the
                        rights of Captain Dahlberg under the treaty between the United States and
                        Russia.</p>
                    <p>In order to a more intelligent consideration of the questions than the meager
                        reports received from the officers of the United States district court will
                        allow, I have caused one of the examiners of this Department to visit the
                        places of the arrest and imprisonment of Captain Dahlberg, to interrogate
                        the United States officers concerned in the arrest and imprisonment, to
                        elicit all the information that can be obtained, and to make full and speedy
                        report of the result of his investigations.</p>
                    <p>On the receipt of this report I shall without delay consider the questions
                        indicated by you, and forward to you the conclusions to which I may be
                        brought.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my letter to you of April 28, 1896, in
                        regard to the arrest and imprisonment of Captain Dahlberg, master of the
                        Russian bark <hi rend="italic">Hans</hi>, by officers of the United States
                        district court for the southern district of Mississippi, I stated that I had
                        caused one of the examiners of this Department to visit the places of the
                        arrest and imprisonment of Captain Dahlberg, to elicit all the information
                        that he could obtain on the subject and make full report of the result of
                        his investigation.</p>
                    <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0364"/>
                    <p>I beg to hand you herewith a copy of the report of Mr. Willoughby Newton, the
                        examiner of this Department who was sent to conduct the investigation, which
                        was received here on yesterday.</p>
                    <p>From this report it would seem that the arrest and imprisonment and detention
                        of Captain Dahlberg were altogether without authority of law, and that
                        personal liability rests upon each of the individuals who were concerned in
                        his arrest and imprisonment.</p>
                    <p>The action of Phelps, deputy clerk of the United States court, in issuing the
                        warrant of arrest was without legal right or authority, and both the clerk,
                        Moseley, and the deputy, Phelps, are each liable on their official bond for
                        breach of the conditions thereof.</p>
                    <p>The action of the deputy marshal, Sugden, in arresting Captain Dahlberg, in
                        detaining him, and in imprisoning him in jail was without authority of law,
                        and subjects the United States marshal, McNeeley, and the deputy, Sugden,
                        severally, to personal action for the trespass committed by them.</p>
                    <p>C. S. Merriwether, the attorney for the plaintiff, appears to have procured
                        the issuance and the execution of the warrant of arrest, and he also is
                        liable to a personal action for false imprisonment.</p>
                    <p>The sheriff, Hughes, who was keeper of the jail at Mississippi City, and who
                        received Captain Dahlberg from the deputy marshal, and confined him in his
                        jail and detained him there, and released him on the request of Merriwether,
                        the attorney for plaintiff, appears to have acted throughout without color
                        of authority, and he also is personally liable.</p>
                    <p>The liability of each of these persons, in damages, for the wrong committed
                        by them, respectively, is to Captain Dahlberg himself, and to no one
                        else.</p>
                    <p>The officers of the United States court who were concerned in the wrongdoing
                        are liable to such punishment as the Government may be authorized to impose,
                        extending to their removal from office.</p>
                    <p>The cause of action set up by the plaintiff, Perttison, in his complaint,
                        appears to have grown out of a difference which had arisen between Captain
                        Dahlberg, as master of the Russian bark <hi rend="italic">Hans</hi>, and
                        Perttison, as one of the crew of that bark, and consequently was one of
                        those “differences” referred to in Article VIII of the treaty of December
                        18, 1832, between the United States and Russia, as to which the “consuls,
                        vice-consuls, and commercial agents shall have the right as such to sit as
                        judges and arbitrators * * * without the interference of the local
                        authorities,” etc.</p>
                    <p>While that treaty remains in force the courts of this country would seem to
                        be without jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate a cause of action
                        originating under such circumstances.</p>
                    <p>There can be no doubt, in my opinion, that Captain Dahlberg has a just and
                        complete cause of action against each of the persons above named who were
                        concerned in his arrest and imprisonment, and have no doubt but that such
                        cause of action can be successfully maintained and adequate recovery had by
                        recourse to the courts of the country.</p>
                    <p>Very respectfully,</p>

                            instant relative to the arrest and incarceration of Capt. G. I.
                            Dahlberg, master of the Russian bark <hi rend="italic">Hans</hi>, while
                            at anchor at Ship Island, southern district of Mississippi, I have the
                            honor to report that I have examined carefully into said matter and find
                            that Captain Dahlberg was arrested on board his ship, the Russian bark
                                <hi rend="italic">Hans</hi>, on February 10, 1896, by United States
                            Deputy Marshal Edward Sugden, on a warrant of arrest regularly addressed
                            to the United States marshal of this district, “commanding said marshal
                            to arrest G. I. Dahlberg and to keep him under safe and secure arrest,
                            so that he may be forthcoming before the judge of the United States
                            district court for said district at Mississippi City on the 17th day of
                            February, 1896, there to answer unto H. M. A. Perttison in a cause of
                            damages, civil and maritime,” said warrant dated February 8, 1896, and
                            signed “L. B. Moseley, clerk, per C. Phelps, D. C.”</p>
                        <p>This writ was issued by United States Deputy Clerk C. Phelps without the
                            authority, direction, or even the knowledge of H. C. Nies, judge of the
                            United States district court, southern district of Mississippi, was
                            executed by United States Deputy Marshal E. Sugden on February 10, 1896,
                            by arresting G. I. Dahlberg, master of the Russian bark <hi
                                rend="italic">Hans</hi>, carrying him to Mississippi City, and
                            confining him there in jail in default of bond, which Captain Dahlberg
                            refused to give.</p>
                        <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0365"/>
                        <p>The penalty of the bond required of Captain Dahlberg was fixed by Deputy
                            Marshal Sugden and C. S. Meriwether (of Stranton), attorney for the
                            plaintiff, Perttison, at $1,000.</p>
                        <p>Captain Dahlberg was kept in jail until February 15, 1896, when he was
                            released unconditionally by Deputy Marshal Sugden, upon the request and
                            at the suggestion of C. S. Meriwether, attorney for the plaintiff,
                            Perttison, in an irregular manner and without any formal discharge from
                            any source whatever. I have been unable to find any mittimus committing
                            Captain Dahlberg to the jail at Mississippi City. Sheriff Hughes
                            informed me that there was a mittimus committing Dahlberg, but he has
                            made diligent search among his jail records and has been unable to show
                            me anything of the sort. The fact is, there was no mittimus, and the
                            prisoner Dahlberg was received at the jail without any commitment of any
                            sort or kind whatever. I have carefully examined the court minutes,
                            dockets, etc., and find that there is not a line or a scratch of a pen
                            relative to the arrest, imprisonment, or release of Captain Dahlberg,
                            not a word on said records relative to Dahlberg or the plaintiff, H. M.
                            A. Perttison.</p>
                        <p>Deputy Clerk Phelps informs me that he was not directed or authorized by
                            anyone to issue the writ for the arrest of Dahlberg, master of the
                            Russian bark <hi rend="italic">Hans</hi>, lying at Ship Island, southern
                            district of Mississippi, but that he did it of his own violition and on
                            his own responsibility, thinking that the issuance of such a writ by him
                            was legal, proper, and in the line of his duty as deputy clerk, acting
                            for L. B. Moseley, clerk of the United States district court, district
                            of southern Mississippi. He could refer me to no United States statute
                            authorizing such a procedure on his part.</p>
                        <p>H. C. Nies, judge of the United States district court in this district,
                            knew nothing of the issuance of the warrant of arrest by Deputy Clerk C.
                            Phelps and the proceedings thereunder until some time after the arrest
                            and imprisonment of Captain Dahlberg, when habeas corpus proceedings
                            were commenced by T. V. Noland, Dahlberg’s attorney, for the release of
                            Captain Dahlberg.</p>
                        <p>Deputy Marshal Sugden informs me that he was not authorized by any court,
                            or by anyone else having authority, to release Captain Dahlberg from
                            jail, but did it because C. S. Meriwether, attorney for plaintiff,
                            requested him to release him, and he supposed that as the plaintiff,
                            Perttison, was the interested party it would be right and proper for him
                            to release the prisoner on the request of the plaintiff’s attorney.</p>
                        <p>This was the most extraordinary, irregular, illegal, and unprecedented
                            proceedings from start to finish, and all parties concerned should, in
                            my opinion, be held to the strictest accountability for same.</p>
                        <p>As to financial standing of parties concerned: United States Clerk
                            Moseley lives at Jackson; is a man of very moderate means; his official
                            bond is good.</p>
                        <p>United States Marshal McNeeley lives at Vicksburg, and he is a man of
                            considerable property; his official bond is believed to be good.</p>
                        <p>Deputy Clerk C. Phelps lives at Mississippi City; owns his house and
                            nothing more; gives no official bond to the clerk. Deputy Marshal Sugden
                            is worth nothing.</p>
                        <p>C. S. Meriwether, attorney for plaintiff, is worth nothing.</p>
                        <p>Sheriff George Hughes is worth considerable property; his official bond
                            as sheriff, $20,000, is said to be good.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my note of the 1st instant I informed you
                        that the Department of Justice had appointed an examiner to collect the
                        evidence necessary to ascertain whether Captain Dahlberg was unlawfully
                        imprisoned, and whether his rights under the treaty between the United
                        States and Russia were violated.</p>
                    <p>I have now the honor to inclose herewith copy of the examiner’s report, and
                        of the Attorney-General’s letter of transmittal. The conclusion of the
                        Department of Justice is that the arrest, imprisonment, and detention of
                        Captain Dahlberg were altogether without authority of law, and that he has a
                        just and complete cause of action against each of the individuals concerned
                        therein, which, in its opinion, can be successfully maintained, and adequate
                        recovery had by recourse to the courts of the country.</p>

                    <p>Captain Dahlberg was arrested the 10th February, 1896, on his ship <hi

                    <p>Letter of the Secretary of Justice to the Secretary of State from 20th May,
                        1896: “From this report it would seem that the arrest and imprisonment and
                        detention of Captain Dahlberg were altogether without authority of law,”
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>The action of Phelps, deputy clerk of the United States court, in issuing the
                        warrant of arrest was without legal right and authority. Article VIII of the
                        treaty of December 18, 1832, between the United States and Russia, as to
                        which the consuls, vice-consuls, and commercial agent shall have the right
                        to sit as judges and arbitrators, * * * without the interference of the
                        local authorities.</p>
                    <p>This was the most extraordinary, irregular, illegal, and unprecedented

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to a letter from your Department of
                        May 20, 1896, I now have the honor to say that on the 17th instant the
                        chargé d’affaires ad interim of Russia called at the Department and made
                        inquiry concerning the arrest and imprisonment of Capt. Gustaf Isak
                        Dahlberg, master and principal owner of the Russian bark <hi rend="italic"
                            >Hans</hi>, while at anchor at Ship Island, Mississippi, February 10,
                        1896.</p>
                    <p>I have made a thorough examination of the complaint and find that the letter
                        of Mr. Conrad’s of May 20, 1896, presents it in detail upon an examination
                        and report by an examiner of your Department. Mr. Conrad’s conclusion is to
                        the effect that the arrest, imprisonment, and detention of Captain Dahlberg
                        were altogether without authority of law, and that personal liability rests
                        upon each of the individuals who are mentioned by name and who were
                        concerned in his arrest and detention. Each of these individuals, with the
                        exception of G. S. Meriwether, the plaintiff’s attorney, who, also regarded
                        as “liable to a personal action for false imprisonment,” is an officer of
                        the United States; and adds Mr. Conrad, “The officers of the United States
                        courts who were concerned in the wrongdoing are liable to such punishment as
                        the Government may be authorized to impose, extending to their removal from
                        office.”</p>
                    <p>I am convinced from a reading of the letter of Mr. Conrad that the action of
                        the officials concerned constitutes a flagrant outrage upon the person of
                        Captain Dahlberg and a violation of the treaty concluded with Russia
                        December 12, 1832. While your Department is technically correct in referring
                        Captain Dahlberg to the courts of this country, in which it is thought
                        adequate recovery may be obtained against each of the individuals, yet, as
                        the Russian Government does not think that Captain Dahlberg should be so
                        remanded to the courts, which opinion I share, I am disposed to tender to
                        him, through the Russian chargé d’affaires, the sum of $1,000 in full
                        satisfaction of his claim. Before making the tender, however, I would be
                        glad to have your views upon the subject. Besides the money consideration,
                        which I think ample on account of his arrest, imprisonment, and detention
                        for five days, I suggest that the Federal officers concerned in this
                        vexatious and unwarranted proceeding be immediately dismissed from their
                        positions. If this is done, it will prove a salutary lesson and possibly
                        prevent a recurrence of like acts in the future.</p>
                    <p>Awaiting your reply before addressing Mr. de Wollant upon the subject,</p>
                    <p>I am, respectfully, yours,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your recent visit to the
                        Department, I have now the honor to say that since that time I have had the
                        case of Capt. Gustav Isak Dahlberg, master and principal owner of the
                        Russian bark <hi rend="italic">Hans</hi>, who was arrested while at anchor
                        at Ship Island, Mississippi, February 10, 1896, fully examined in the light
                        especially of the letter of the Acting Attorney-General of May 20, 1896, to
                        which you then called my attention. It is unnecessary to repeat the
                        statements touching Captain Dahlberg’s arrest, which were admittedly without
                        warrant of law. He was discharged from custody February 15, 1896. Taking
                        into consideration the fact that Captain Dahlberg has his remedy in the
                        courts of this country against the individuals concerned in his arrest, and
                        where adequate recovery may, in the opinion of the Acting Attorney-General,
                        be had against each one of them, I have, by direction of the President, to
                        tender to Captain Dahlberg, through yourself, the sum of $1,000 in full
                        satisfaction of his complaint.</p>
                    <p>I make this tender without thereby assuming liability on the part of the
                        Federal Government, although I may observe that, according to a letter from
                        the Attorney-General of the 30th ultimo, that officer has promised to give
                        immediate attention to my suggestion that the Federal officials who may have
                        been connected with the assault upon Captain Dahlberg be dismissed from the
                        service.</p>
                    <p>Awaiting your pleasure as to the acceptance by Captain Dahlberg of the amount
                        so tendered, I beg you to accept, etc.,</p>

                        that your note of July 8, 1897, has been duly forwarded through the foreign
                        office at Petersburg to Capt. Gustaf Dahlberg.</p>
                    <p>Considered that his arrest without warrant of law and his detention until
                        February 15 has been the cause of great pecuniary losses, Captain Dahlberg
                        declares that he can not be satisfied with the sum of $1,000, tendered by
                        your excellency. In his claim Captain Dahlberg points out he was obliged to
                        find and pay another captain to bring the ship to Europe. The money paid to
                        the lawyers, traveling expenses of the said captain, the loss of time, and
                        disturbance in his money affairs amount to $5,000.</p>
                    <p>Captain Dahlberg claims that, having been arrested by the duly appointed
                        authorities in the name of the President of the United States, his claim can
                        not be directed against the individuals concerned in his arrest, they having
                        acted not as private persons but in their official capacity. Not having the
                        necessary means, he considers the advice to find remedy in the courts of
                        this country as a refusal of justice.</p>
                    <p>Considering, for my part, that cases like the unlawful arrest of Captain
                        Dahlberg can not have a favorable influence on the commercial relations of
                        our respective countries, on our tradesmen and people engaged in the
                        shipping business, I will feel <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0368"/>very
                        much obliged to your excellency if you will reconsider the matter and give

                        solution.</p>

                        <head>The Cape Horn Pigeon.</head>
                        <p>As the defendant party in the case of the seizure and detention of this
                            vessel recognizes that an indemnity is due, there remains but to settle
                            the amount of damage interest to be paid to the party claimant.</p>
                        <p>The party claimant maintains that it is not bound by the claims presented
                            by the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> as a
                            complete statement of damages suffered. The captain was, at the moment
                            of the seizure and until the moment of arrival in an American harbor,
                            the natural guardian of the interested parties. And it is probable that
                            if the Russian Government had indemnified him according to the
                            conditions which he proposed, that indemnity would have been agreed to
                            by all the interested parties as a compromise. But once the captain’s
                            proposition was rejected it has no more weight, and the claimants are
                            free to present new claims, including damages sustained by them of which
                            the captain had lost sight.</p>
                        <p>There is no longer any question of how much Captain Scullun or other
                            agent of the claimants may then have asked, but of how much is due in
                            equity to the claimants for the damages they sustained.</p>
                        <p>1. The opinion of the party claimant that the loss of the catch
                            constitutes the true measure of damage sustained in the loss of service
                            of the vessel is set forth both in the memorandum and in the
                            observations of this rejoinder, which relate generally to the four cases
                            in litigation.</p>
                        <p>2. As to the claims for indemnity of each member of the crew in the sum
                            of $1,000 for their enforced service in the Russian navy and their
                            compulsory navigation of a Russian armed cruiser, as well as the
                            subsequent bad treatment, it appears that the defendant party finds a
                            repetition of the claim for services of the crew in conducting the
                            Russian cruiser to Vladivostok, which is estimated at $1,200. This is a
                            mistake. The services of the crew in this respect, for which the
                            defendant party admits these men should be remunerated, are entirely
                            distinct from the questions touching the bad treatment or their enforced
                            naval service of a country other than their own.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party admits that the seizure of the <hi rend="italic">Cape
                                Horn Pigeon</hi> was a much to be regretted error, for which
                            indemnity is due. Therefore there is no escaping the conclusion that all
                            restraint inflicted upon these men constituted a wrong done them. This
                            being true, the taking them from their own vessel and placing them as
                            crew aboard a man-of-war flying the flag of a country other their own
                            and obliging them to navigate such vessel was an outrage to them, and
                            failure to recognize the gravity of that outrage would be to open the
                            way to seizure of merchant vessels on the high seas and the impressment
                            of their crews into foreign marine service by every armed cruiser that
                            so desired.</p>
                        <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0370"/>
                        <p>Concerning the question of bad treatment sustained by the crew of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Cape Rom Pigeon</hi> at Vladivostok, the defendant
                            party protests against the allegations of the party claimant in that
                            regard, but is content to quote the opinion expressed by the chargé
                            d’affaires of the United States at St. Petersburg in his note of the 9th
                            (21st) September, 1892 (Exhibit K of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                                Pigeon</hi>), and the allegation that the crew of the whaler was
                            twice and one-half as numerous as that of the cruiser. In the first
                            place, the note of the chargé d’affaires expresses only the opinion, “I
                            trust and believe.” As to the question of numerical strength, it
                            suffices to say the whaler was a merchant ship without armament, which
                            had to deal with an armed cruiser of the Russian navy, with all which
                            that implies.</p>
                        <p>It appears that in the case in question the defendant party takes the
                            position that the captain and crew should have made resistance to the
                            seizure, although in the case of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi> this same resistance is cited as wrong as well as proof
                            of guilt.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party expresses the opinion in the counter-memorandum that
                            all of the members of the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                                Pigeon</hi> were not Americans, and that the claims of such among
                            them as were of other nationalities should be presented by their
                            respective Governments.</p>
                        <p>The party claimant contests this view. The sailors who embarked upon the
                                <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> were entitled to the
                            protection of the United States flag which it carried. The owners of the
                            vessel are the guardians of the members of the crew for their share of
                            the catch, or of the indemnity allowed in lieu of it, as also for all
                            compensation they may receive, and the United States Government, whose
                            duty it is to protect sailors who embark under her flag, is not relieved
                            of her obligation toward them until she presents their claims for
                            indemnity for losses and wrongs suffered by them. These claims are not
                            presented by the members of the crew, but by the United States
                            Government. There were no Russian subjects among the crew of this
                            vessel, and the party claimant submits that as guardian of the interests
                            of these men in this respect it is for that nation whose flag was
                            violated to pre sent their claims, and not for the several Governments
                            to which these men respectively owed allegiance to do so.</p>
                        <p>This principle was recognized in the affair <hi rend="italic">Trent</hi>,
                            where an English packet was seized in open sea by an armed cruiser of
                            the United States and two persons among the passengers were seized by a
                            belligerent. It was admitted that the Government of Great Britain had
                            the right to demand restitution of these persons into its jurisdiction,
                            which was accordingly done.</p>
                        <p>The conditions of the protocol do not fix the limits of nationality of
                            the claimants, but on the contrary it states that the two high
                            contracting powers are of accord in submitting to arbitration the case
                            of the whaling vessel <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, her
                            shipowners, captain, officers, and crew. The arbitration is declared to
                            be between the two Governments. Thus the Government becomes the guardian
                            of the interests of all the crew without distinction of nationality.</p>
                        <p>3. Regarding the claim of $1,200 for services of the officers and crew of
                            the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> for navigating the Russian
                            cruiser, the claimant party refers again to the arguments on this
                            subject contained in the memorandum, wherein the grounds for this claim
                            are set forth.</p>
                        <p>What the captain demanded when he was in a position to act as agent <pb
                                n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0371"/>for the claimants should have
                            no consideration here. It is rather a question of what is the just and
                            equitable indemnity for the services rendered in this regard that is in
                            litigation. The admission of the defendant party that a sum of $1,000
                            for indemnity is due shows very clearly that the ordinary wages of the
                            sailors are not considered sufficient compensation under the
                            circumstances. The defendant party assents to the round sum demanded by
                            the captain, but does not indicate how that sum should be distributed
                            among the crew.</p>
                        <p>4. The sums of $200 for provisions consumed, and $210 for lodgings, and
                            $50 for the personal expenses of Captain Scullun are not disputed.</p>
                        <p>5. As to the principal of $3,040 the claimant party must again refer to
                            the memorandum wherein the details of this total are fully set
                            forth.</p>
                        <p>6. The matter of interest not having been disputed as a principle, the
                            party claimant does not think necessary to return to that portion of the
                            claim.</p>
                        <p>To sum up, the party claimant reiterates the demand for indemnity for
                            damages which are set forth in the memorandum for the seizure and
                            detention of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, her officers
                            and crew, by submitting to the honorable arbitrator that the defendant
                            party has failed in any way to rebut the evidence presented in the
                            memorandum in support of these claims stop. The party claimant asks
                            therefore that the total amount of indemnity claimed be granted,
                            including interest from the moment of seizure until the day of the
                            receipt by the party claimant of the amounts which may be allowed.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the question of the duty of the United States Government to
                            protect the sailors of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> who
                            were not American citizens, the defendant party cites the sentences of
                            the Court of Claims for the settlement and distribution of the sums
                            allowed in the arbitration at Geneva on <hi rend="italic">Alabama</hi>

                        <p>On the 18th (30th) of May, 1896, the Imperial Russian Government
                            presented to the United States diplomatic representative at St.
                            Petersburg a memorandum emanating from the imperial minister of the
                            Russian navy, which undertook to demonstrate, from the Russian point of
                            view, the facts of the seizure of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi>. (Exhibit H of the memorandum, case of <hi rend="italic"
                                >James Hamilton Lewis.</hi>) In the memorandum it is declared that
                            the schooner was overhauled by the Russian cruiser at 5.15 a.m. at 12
                            miles from the Copper Island, after having sighted her at 4.40 o’clock
                            on the same morning at a point alleged to be within the Russian
                            jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>On July 23 (August 4), 1898, the United States diplomatic representative,
                            referring to these figures, called the attention of the Imperial
                            Government to the fact that the seizure having been made at 12 miles
                            from the coast, after a chase lasting not over half an hour, it was
                            impossible for the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> to have
                            been in Russian territorial waters at the moment it was sighted, and
                            that the nearest point of proximity possible was 6 miles from the coast.
                            (Exhibit N of the memorandum, case of the <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis.</hi>) In reply to that communication the Imperial
                            Government caused another memorandum to be sent to the United States
                            ambassador from the minister of marine (Exhibit N), under date of
                            October 19, 1898, which, without noting any alteration with regard to
                            the hour of the overhauling the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi> by the Russian cruiser, shows that the distance was 11
                            miles from the Russian coast at the moment of arrest. The exhibits
                            attached to the counter memorandum are now seen for the first time by
                            the party claimant, although the correspondence on the subject of the
                            seizure of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> has continued
                            for more than six years, and it is only now informed that the hour of
                            the seizure was 6.15 instead of 5.15, as stated in the first place.</p>
                        <p>It must be admitted that there is here a certain lack of accuracy in the
                            figures, which might be found, also, in the definite statements as to
                            the positions of the vessels, that of the <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis</hi> when it was sighted being determined by
                            appearances, which are known to be excessively deceptive, and which vary
                            with atmospheric conditions. As to the point at which the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was overhauled by the
                            cruiser, the defendant party has not submitted one single proof to
                            establish her distance from land, and it is even evident that the
                            captain of the cruiser had but vague impressions on this point, since he
                            states in one document that the seizure took place at 12 miles and in
                            another at 11 miles from the Copper Island.</p>
                        <p>But in any event, the defendant party has never pretended that the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was found in a proximity of
                            less than 5 miles from Russian land. To justify the seizure, the
                            defendant party claims <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0373"/>a
                            jurisdiction over the waters to that distance from the coasts. It can
                            not be pretended now that the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi> was within 5 miles of the Russian coast on the morning in
                            question, and if it was not within that distance of the land it was not
                            within the limits of the jurisdiction to which the defendant party
                            claims a right.</p>
                        <p>But the Imperial Russian Government has declared on several occasions in
                            its public documents, as well as in its correspondence, that the limits
                            of its jurisdiction did not extend beyond 3 miles from the coast. See
                            Exhibits B B and C C of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, in
                            the memo randum, and Exhibit A, hereunto annexed, viz, a certified
                            translation of clause 21 of the imperial Russian navy prize rights,
                            wherein is shown the limit of maritime jurisdiction claimed and
                            recognized by Russia as being 3 miles. And from the publication of these
                            documents until the moment of the seizure of the <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis</hi> Russia has never publicly claimed a more
                            extended maritime jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>The party claimant does not propose to enter into a discussion of the
                            question of the extent of marine jurisdiction which should be recognized
                            to-day and which is not within the scope of the present litigation, but
                            it holds to the opinion that no government having publicly proclaimed
                            that its marine jurisdiction is limited to 3 miles can exercise a more
                            extended jurisdiction, in order to enforce its municipal laws, without
                            previous notice to those whom it may concern.</p>
                        <p>But aside from the question of marine jurisdiction over the point in
                            which the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was navigating,
                            the counter memorandum of the defendant party does not contain the least
                            affirmative proof that this vessel, her master, or her crew had ever
                            been engaged in any illegitimate business whatsoever, either against
                            international law or the municipal laws of the Russian Empire. The
                            defendant party has not presented proofs that it sustained any damage or
                            losses of any description in which the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi> could justly be accused of being implicated.</p>
                        <p>Now, the case presents only the facts that the Russian Government owns
                            certain islands whereon there are fur seals; that near these islands its
                            agents found a vessel whose occupation was catching fur seals in mid
                            sea, a business well recognized at that time as legitimately carried on
                            on the high seas, and the Russian Government, through the medium of its
                            agents, seized and confiscated said vessel simply on the suspicion that,
                            being in Russian territory, it had violated Russian municipal laws. The
                            party claimant, far from denying that aboard the <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton. Lewis</hi> were found skins of fur seals, on the contrary
                            declares that this vessel, while pursuing its legitimate business, had
                            caught fur seals on the high seas, and it is for the skins of the seals
                            thus caught and later confiscated by the Russian Government that it now
                            seeks payment in the present arbitration.</p>
                        <p>The reports of Thomas Morgan and John Malowansky, cited in the memorandum
                            (case of the James<hi rend="italic">Hamilton Lewis</hi>, Exhibit F),
                            prove that these skins, being the skins of females, constituted a
                            typical pelagic catch. That is to say, that the seals in question were
                            not taken either on or near land, but on the high seas, as has been
                            declared by the captain and crew of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis:</hi></p>
                        <p>Neither is the fact contradicted that aboad the vessel were the skins of
                            two small seals, too young to swim; but Exhibit F of the same case of
                            the memorandum is again quoted as evidence in support of the fact that
                            the presence of these two skins constituted, on the contrary, <pb
                                n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0374"/>a proof that the schooner was
                            engaged in fishing on the high seas. The party claimant has abundantly
                            demonstrated that young seals are often taken alive from the bellies of
                            their mothers, that it is a common occurrence in pelagic sealing, and
                            that the skins of these young seals constitute a class of merchandise
                            regularly quoted on the London market. However, the defendant party
                            still holds the view that the presence of these skins of young seals
                            aboard the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was a proof that
                            they had been caught on the islands. But the defendant party failed to
                            produce any testimony as to the nature of these skins of young seals, or
                            that they were other than as sworn to by the master of the schooner. The
                            defendant party states that an expert declared that these skins were of
                            young seals taken on the islands, but as he furnished no testimony in
                            support of this declaration it should not be admitted as evidence. In
                            fact, this testimony is based only on hearsay. In order that the
                            presence of these skins of young seals aboard the <hi rend="italic"
                                >James Hamilton Lewis</hi> weigh against the corroborative testimony
                            presented in Exhibit F, in support of the sworn statements of Captain
                            MacLean it must be very clearly shown that these young seals had been
                            taken not only on land, but on Russian land, for it must be remembered
                            that the American Seal Islands were quite as convenient to poachers as
                            those of Russia.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party maintains the opinion that the resistance to seizure
                            on the part of the master of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi> constitutes proof that he felt guilty. Such
                            interpretation of his action is not justified. The master felt he was
                            where he had perfect right to be and was engaged in legitimate business,
                            and believing that no one had the right to molest him he exercised his
                            absolute rights by resisting his seizure on the high seas. Neither does
                            the fact, if it be a fact, as stated but not proven, that he had hidden
                            the skins of seals he had caught, admit of interpretation of possession
                            without right.</p>
                        <p>If the captain feared that they would be confiscated if discovered,
                            although he had obtained them legitimately, it appears that his fear was
                            but too well founded, seeing the confiscation of the sealskins aboard
                            the <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>, which the defendant party
                            admits was illegal.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party undertakes, in the counter memorandum, to demonstrate
                            that the fact that the captain of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi> failed to produce the log book of the schooner is a proof
                            of guilt. One may not rightfully put such a construction on the
                            captain’s reticence. As has been shown in the memorandum, the captain
                            presented all of the documents they had the right to ask on the high
                            seas according to international law. He kept in reserve his journal to
                            prove an alibi when the proper moment should arrive—that is to say, when
                            he had been conducted before a prize court where he would have a chance
                            to furnish testimony in his own defense before competent judges and not
                            before his captors. But this opportunity was never accorded him. His
                            case was tried by his captors, who showed him the act of confiscation
                            after having signed it. It was then that he inscribed his protest in the
                            act, still reserving his evidence until he should reach his own country,
                            there to present it to his Government with all the proofs in support of
                            his claim and of the shipowners and crew of his vessel.</p>
                        <p>A copy of this log book was included with the documents annexed to the
                            note of the United States minister at St. Petersburg, presenting <pb
                                n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0375"/>the case to the attention of
                            the Imperial Government the 11th July, 1894 (Exhibit G of the present
                            case of the memorandum), and that it was duly received is clearly
                            demonstrated by the note of the imperial Russian minister of foreign
                            affairs of the 18th May, 1896 (Exhibit R of the memorandum of the same
                            case).</p>
                        <p>The defendant party has no reason to complain of the delay in the
                            delivery of the original of this document, nor to express doubt of its
                            authenticity on account of that delay. The captain of the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was not obliged to prove an
                            alibi to the commander of the Russian cruiser; on the contrary, the onus
                            probandi of wrongdoing rested solely upon the latter. Even though the
                                <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> had been at the moment
                            she was sighted in Russian territorial waters her pursuit into open sea,
                            where she was seized, required absolute proofs of the wrong of
                            infraction of the municipal laws within the jurisdiction of Russia to
                            justify her detention if only for an instant.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party permits itself to be carried away by its desire to
                            discredit the authenticity of the log book. No repeated demands were
                            made by the defendant party of the party claimant for the production of
                            the log book; on the contrary, a copy of the log book, which it seems is
                            in every respect the counterpart of the original, was submitted to the
                            defendant party, as has been stated above, in the presentation of the
                            case. This took place three years after the seizure. In 1896 the party
                            claimant expressed the desire to submit the original log book to the
                            defendant party for examination in order that he might compare it with
                            the copy and assure himself of its authenticity, which the party
                            claimant believed to be evident, and in fact this desire was verbally
                            repeated several times by the diplomatic representative of the party
                            claimant, but not until a year later did the defendant party consent to
                            examine the document.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party in its counter memorandum disputes the authen ticity
                            of the log book; but it has never presented any testimony, either expert
                            or of facts, to support its position. It expresses the opinion that the
                            fact that a number of entries are made with the same ink is suspicious.
                            It is more than probable that a vessel of this character was not
                            provided with a great variety of inks, and that the same officer being
                            in charge of the entries always used the same ink. As to the simple
                            opinion of the defendant party regarding the authenticity of the log
                            book, the party claimant refers to his former arguments on that subject
                            in its memorandum and the fact that the captain and several members of
                            the crew testified under oath to its authenticity.</p>
                        <p>Thus, in the absence of contrary testimony, this document should be
                            accepted as valid and authentic.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party raises the fact that the party claimant, in
                            submitting the copy of the log book presented to the honorable
                            arbitrator, failed to include the indorsement in Russian written upon
                            the original logbook by the imperial minister of marine on the occasion
                            of its delivery to the Imperial Government for examination by the
                            diplomatic representative of the United States. The party claimant
                            considers this indorsement, made long after the occurrence of the events
                            which form the subject of the present arbitration, as entirely
                            inapplicable and unimportant.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, any indorsement upon a document thus submitted is unjustifiable
                            and irregular, and can not be considered as forming a part of the log
                            book. Such as it is, however, it remains upon the log book, <pb n="352"
                                xml:id="pg_352" facs="0376"/>which is now in the hands of the
                            honorable arbitrator, and the defend ant party evidently possesses a
                            copy.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the treatment which the captain and crew of the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> suffered at the hands of the
                            Russian authorities, the defendant party is content to protest in
                            general against the testimony offered by the party claimant. It is,
                            however, difficult to say what further proofs could have been produced
                            by the party claimant in support of allegations of such nature. The
                            party claimant presented the sworn depositions of five witnesses
                            relative to the alleged bad treatment. The burden of refutation of this
                            testimony remains, therefore, upon the defendant party, who failed to
                            furnish any proofs whatever that would show the contrary or would in any
                            way destroy the credibility of these witnesses. On the contrary, the
                            defendant party admits that because of their resistance these men were
                            submitted to “more rigorous measures” than would have been employed if
                            they had not resisted arrest. But their arrest being illegal and on the
                            high seas they had a perfect right to resist, so that damages are due
                            them on account of the severe measures which the defendant party
                            acknowledges having taken against them.</p>
                        <p>But apart from all question of bad treatment, these men are entitled to
                            indemnity on account of their illegal seizure and their detention as
                            prisoners, and in this connection the arguments set forth in the general
                            consideration of the questions submitted to arbitration are again cited
                            here, together with the testimony showing the amount of damages awarded
                            to the Russian Captain Dahlberg for having been illegally arrested by
                            the United States authorities.</p>
                        <p>The counter memorandum of the defendant party has in no way altered this
                            case such as set forth in the memorandum of the party claimant.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was seized in open sea,
                            entirely beyond Russian jurisdiction, which this vessel never
                            reached.</p>
                        <p>The Russian Government produced no proof to show that it had penetrated
                            such jurisdiction, that any wrong whatsoever had been committed by
                            anyone whomsoever within Russian territory, or that the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, or anyone whomsoever aboard
                            this vessel, had in any way contravened the municipal law of Russia
                            within Russian jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>The vessel was seized simply upon a suspicion, which was in no way
                            verified.</p>
                        <p>On the ground of this suspicion the vessel was confiscated without
                            submitting its case to a prize court, as the laws of nations require,
                            but upon an act of confiscation drawn up by a commission composed of
                            those who had made the seizure. That is to say, that the officers who
                            made the seizure were their own judges, and their decision by which they
                            justified their act was rendered not only without permitting the captain
                            and crew of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> to justify
                            themselves, but contrary to all the evidence in the case.</p>
                        <p>Nothing in the evidence of the officers of the Russian cruiser can in any
                            way implicate the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, her
                            captain, or crew in sealing in Russian waters. It is admitted that this
                            vessel was engaged in pelagic sealing; and consequently there were
                            aboard her a variety of instruments necessary to that occupation. The
                            officer detailed for the investigation declared that he discovered
                            evidences of a hasty putting in order, but he does not specify in what
                            that haste consisted. This fact <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0377"
                            />can not be accepted as proof, even though it was demonstrated. He
                            discovered a tub containing reddened water covered with a red flannel
                            shirt. This shows that a member of the crew had been employed in washing
                            a red shirt of inferior dye, but it does not prove that the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> had been sealing in Russian
                            waters any more than the fact, if it were a fact, that the seal skins
                            were strewn with salt to preserve them is a proof of guilt.</p>
                        <p>The Copper Island is the most remote Russian possession in Bering Sea. To
                            the east, to south, and southeast of that island there is no Russian
                            territory. The Russian territory nearest that island is the Bering
                            Island, situated a little to northwest. The schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was, when sighted by the Russian cruiser,
                            sailing toward the Copper Island, coming from the southeast. It was
                            nearest the Copper Island at the moment it veered from north. If she had
                            been engaged in sealing in Russian waters, how could her course have
                            been northwest, advancing toward Copper Island? It has not been claimed
                            that this vessel nor any other vessel had been navigating in the
                            vicinity of Russian land.</p>
                        <p>No proof has been produced by the defendant party to refute either the
                            statements made by Captain MacLean or the proofs submitted by the party
                            claimant. And no proof has been presented to corroborate the simple
                            suspicion formed by the Russian officers that the <hi rend="italic"
                                >James Hamilton Lewis</hi> had already been, or contemplated,
                            trespassing upon Russian jurisdictional waters.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, it has been clearly demonstrated that the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was confiscated and that her
                            officers and crew were detained prisoners, all the evidence showing that
                            these men suffered harsh treatment.</p>
                        <p>The claimant party therefore submits to the honorable arbitrator— <list>

                                    commission in 1869, and in submitting them to the director of
                                    the ministry of marine his excellency ordered the following
                                    resolution: “Send this collection to the commander of the

                                    on the 16th of September, 1869.” In executing this resolution to
                                    transmit them to vessels, there were printed 200 copies. In 1871
                                    a new commission was called, under the presidency of Admiral

                        <p>The exact position of the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> at the
                            moment of seizure is of small consequence. That is to say, it matters
                            little whether it was in 54° 10’or 54° 18’ latitude, since it is
                            admitted by the defendant party that the seizure took place 23 miles
                            from the Russian coasts.</p>
                        <p>It is also immaterial that the master of the schooner, basing his
                            assertion upon the best information that he possessed, declared that it
                            was at 80 miles from Russian land. He showed exactly the geographical
                            position of the vessel, and his declaration that said position was 80
                            miles distant from Russian land constitutes only an error of
                            calculation. However, it is but just to say that when measuring the
                            distance to make his declaration after the seizure Captain Furman used
                            an erroneous chart published by the United States Coast Survey, which
                            showed the Copper Island in latitude 55° 35’, which would have made that
                            island 80 miles distant from the point where the <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                                White</hi> was at the moment of her seizure. The chart used by
                            Captain Furman for the navigation of the vessel was confiscated by the
                            commander of the Russian cruiser. In support of this explanation of the
                            error of Captain Furman and to prove his veracity, a copy of said
                            erroneous chart is annexed hereunto, marked “Exhibit A.”</p>
                        <p>The defendant party declares in the counter memorandum that the seizure
                            took place 23 miles from Russian territory; it was consequently beyond
                            Russian jurisdictional waters.</p>
                        <p>The sole justification for the seizure of this vessel presented by the
                            defendant party is, it was suspected of having navigated in Russian
                            waters and of having therein committed an infraction of Russian
                            municipal laws.</p>
                        <p>This suspicion is based, according to the argument of the defendant
                            party, upon the following alleged circumstances, which are entirely
                            unsupported by proof: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>That the vessel was sailing without distinguishing
                                    lights;</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>That the log book showed that the vessel had been in the
                                    proximity of the Russian coasts, and that this log had not been
                                    kept during two days;</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>That the course followed by the vessel showed a passage at 3
                                    miles off the southern extremity of the Copper Island;
                                    and</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>That aboard the vessel were found skins of fur seals.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Regarding the first declaration, it must be observed that the seizure
                            took place in latitude 54° 10’ or in 54° 18’ on the 3d (15th) July, at
                            10.30 p.m., at which hour on that date in those latitudes it is not yet
                            dark and there is no need of lights. That is clearly demonstrated by the
                            fact that the vessel was sighted at a distance of 2 miles distinctly
                            enough to enable the cruiser to give a detailed and exact description
                                <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0382"/>of the schooner. It is even
                            doubtful if it is, possible to see colored lights in that light,
                            therefore it is not proven that the vessel carried none.</p>
                        <p>The use of distinctive lights is required by the marine regulations as a
                            measure of precaution when navigating at night, but when it is possible
                            to see distinctly a vessel 2 miles distant the necessity for showing
                            lights does not exist. In any event, the failure to show distinguishing
                            lights when navigating the open sea during the night, while it
                            constitutes an infraction of the international marine regulations, is
                            not an act which justifies the seizure and confiscation of a foreign
                            vessel by an armed cruiser. Nor can it be said that the absence of
                            distinguishing lights under the existing conditions, and which rendered
                            the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> distinctly visible 2 miles
                            distant, is a proof of an attempt at escape from observation on the part
                            of the guilty vessel. On the contrary, from the <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                                White</hi> the cruiser was as plainly visible as the schooner was
                            from the latter, and it was well known that here was a Russian
                            man-of-war which had seen them, and if the captain wished to save
                            himself, surely he would do nothing that would expose him to the
                            cruiser’s suspicions.</p>
                        <p>As to the allegations of the defendant party relating to the statements
                            contained in the log book of the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>,
                            aside from the question whether or not a government has the right to
                            seize a foreign vessel on the high seas upon suspicion that it has
                            violated the municipal laws of that government, the fact remains that
                            the defendant party did not produce the log book of the <hi
                                rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, which was confiscated with the
                            vessel, there does not exist any testimony in support of the allegations
                            of the defendant party concerning the declarations said to be contained
                            in the log book, and consequently of the deductions that have been drawn
                            therefrom.</p>
                        <p>The party claimant mentioned in his memorandum that the document is in
                            the hands of the defendant party, and that allegations not supported by
                            the presentation of the log book itself ought to be considered as
                            inapplicable and excluded. And the presentation of the log book should
                            not be admitted now as evidence in the arbitration, since by the terms
                            of the protocol the party claimant is not permitted to rebut it.</p>
                        <p>The declaration of the defendant party that the course of the <hi
                                rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> indicated that it had been 3 miles
                            from the Copper Island is a mere supposition not at all supported by
                            evidence. It is not evident upon what ground that conjecture was
                            founded, but the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> did not follow any
                            fixed course with the purpose of arriving at a particular point without
                            delay, but was engaged in sealing on the high seas, an occupation which
                            left her free to change her course frequently in a short space of time,
                            and she very probably did so a short time before being sighted by the
                            cruiser. Even though it had been proved that the <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                                White</hi> had navigated in waters within 3 miles from Russian land,
                            there still remains the right of an innocent passage, and without
                            definite proofs that the vessel had committed an infraction of the laws
                            they had assuredly no right to seize her, even though we admit the right
                            to pursue on the high seas for breaking the municipal laws.</p>
                        <p>The party claimant admits that the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> was
                            a vessel engaged in sealing, a business entirely legitimate at that
                            time; therefore it was equipped for that business, and that it had
                            aboard the skins of seals, <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0383"
                            />product of such catch. But it submits that the defendant party failed
                            to produce the slightest evidence either to show that it had committed
                            any depredation whatever within the Russian jurisdiction or that the <hi
                                rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> or anyone aboard her had entered
                            Russian territory.</p>
                        <p>The allegations of the defendant party that the <hi rend="italic">C H.
                                White</hi> was engaged in sealing in Russian waters are simply
                            expressions of opinion. Not only does the counter memorandum contain no
                            evidence in support of these allegations, but furnishes no refutation of
                            the claimant’s proofs and arguments contained in its memorandum. It is
                            true that the defendant party replied to the citation of the case of the
                                <hi rend="italic">Costa Pica Packet</hi> made by the party claimant,
                            that the latter did not resemble the present case: The party claimant
                            begs to call attention to the fact that the case of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Costa Pica Packet</hi> was cited as a precedent for
                            the recognition of the loss of the catch as measure of damages in the
                            award of an arbitrator, in the case of a vessel illegally seized and
                            detained.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party objects to the amount of damages claimed for the
                            arrest and detention of the officers and crew of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >C. H. White</hi>. These men were detained as prisoners for nearly a
                            month, and were subjected to treatment which the defendant party, while
                            denying that it was severe, excuses on the plea of lack of facilities,
                            but which the officers and crew unite in declaring under oath to have
                            been extremely harsh. No evidence having been presented to refute these
                            declarations nor the credibility of these witnesses, their testimony
                            must be accepted, and the party claimant refers to this testimony for
                            the details of their treatment.</p>
                        <p>The degree of ill treatment was certainly much less in the case of the
                            captain of the <hi rend="italic">Hans</hi> (Exhibit C), who was paid
                            $3,000 by the United States Government for his arrest and detention of
                            five days. Thus the party claimant is convinced that the honorable
                            arbitrator will find the indemnity claimed under this head far from
                            exaggerated.</p>
                        <p>The allegation of the defendant party that the valuation of the vessel
                            and its equipment is estimated only by interested persons is entirely
                            without reason and quite erroneous.</p>
                        <p>Two witnesses of unquestionable integrity and fully competent, besides
                            the president of the company to which the <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                                White</hi> belonged, testified under oath as to their impartiality,
                            as well as to the value of the vessel and her equipment, whereas another
                            testified as to the probable catch during the remainder of the season
                            after her seizure.</p>
                        <p>All that is proved by the testimony presented by the defendant party is
                            that the <hi rend="italic">C H. White</hi> was seized on the high seas
                            under the simple suspicion of having violated the Russian municipal laws
                            near Russian waters, and for that reason it was confiscated without
                            trial by a prize court and without permitting the captain of the vessel
                            to justify himself, but the officer who arrested her constituting
                            himself judge of his own actions, thus arbitrarily confiscating the
                            vessel.</p>
                        <p>In fact, the defendant party failed to present any proofs whatever that
                            could refute any of the testimony in support of the claims set forth in
                            the memorandum, or to justify in any way whatsoever the seizure and
                            confiscation of the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, or which could
                            show a sufficient cause why they should not pay the whole amount of
                            damages claimed.</p>
                        <p>The case of the defendant party should be considered closed, except in so
                            far as concerns the refutation of testimony or of arguments contained
                                <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0384"/>in the present rejoinder to
                            the counter memorandum, since the protocol does not prescribe any
                            opportunity for the party claimant to refute any further evidence or
                            arguments which the defendant party may have to present.</p>
                        <p>The party claimant therefore submits the case to the honorable arbitrator
                            in the firm belief that he will grant the total amount of damages
                            claimed.</p>
                        <p>The party claimant notes that the printed copy of Exhibit I of the
                            counter memorandum shows that Captain Furman wrote upon this document
                            the following statement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The position at noon was latitude 54° 18’ north and longitude
                                    167° 19’ east. I was not on deck at the time the man-of-war was
                                    sighted and could not answer for the lights not being in order,
                                    and I also believed that I was breaking the laws or rules.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Although it is of little importance as regards the right of seizure and
                            of confiscation of the vessel whether or not the captain thought he was
                            violating the rules of navigation concerning the distinctive lights, it
                            is very evident that herein is an error of some sort, either of
                            transcription of the original or on the part of the captain in writing
                            the note in question. The phrase as it appears in the printed copy is
                            illogical, without meaning, and entirely non sequitur.</p>
                        <p>The phrase as it appears in the transcription begins by saying that the
                            captain was ignorant of the absence of distinguishing lights, and then,
                            although using the conjunction “also,” he contradicts himself by saying:
                            “I also believed I was breaking the laws or rules.” The most ignorant
                            persons do not use the conjunction “also” to unite such expressions in
                            English. It is quite evident that the captain intended to say, and
                            probably really did say: “And I also believed I was breaking no laws or
                            rules.” The mere substitution of the word “the” for “no” strips the
                            phrase of meaning instead of making it appear that the captain
                            acknowledged himself guilty. Consequently the party claimant prays the
                            honorable arbitrator to examine the original of this document, believing
                            he will find that Captain Furman wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The position at noon was latitude 54° 18’ north and longitude
                                    167° 19’ east. I was not on deck at the time the man-of-war was
                                    sighted, and could not answer for the lights not being in order,
                                    and I also believed that I was breaking no laws or rules.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Which is evidently what he intended to say.</p>
                        <p>Again, it is possible that the captain, in the agitation of the moment,
                            omitted the word “not.”</p>
                        <p>However, the question of this phrase is not of great importance here
                            because, even if the captain knew that he was at fault regarding the
                            rules governing distinctive lights, it does not follow that he had
                            trespassed upon Russian jurisdiction and does not justify the seizure
                            and confiscation of the vessel.</p>

                            vessel in the beginning of the season were sold at the rate of $14 each.
                            This fact is not denied by the defendant party. It is content with the
                            argument that the skins in question were not upon the London market, but
                            in Bering Sea, and that the price should be reduced on account of that
                            fact, because it would have cost something to transport them from where
                            they were seized to London; consequently it proposes the price of $10
                            apiece.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party does not show whereon it bases this estimate of the
                            cost of transporting the skins to London; but in any case, no claim for
                            the reduction of price should be admitted.</p>
                        <p>The owner had the right to transport the skins in any way he chose, and
                            the price he received in the beginning of the season, viz, $14 apiece,
                            is the only just estimate for his cargo.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party denies the sworn testimony of the master of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> concerning the orders which were
                            given him by the commander of the Russian cruiser. It was shown that
                            Captain Lutjens, as owner of the vessel, is a responsible man, and his
                            sworn testimony should be believed until disproved.</p>
                        <p>He emphatically swore that the commander of the cruiser ordered him to
                            “stop sealing and go home.” This is denied by the defendant party, but
                            without producing sufficient evidence to refute Lutjens’s declaration.
                            No denial on the part of the commander of the cruiser has been
                            submitted, although it would have been easy to produce if the officer
                            had been ready to solemnly deny that he had used that language.</p>
                        <p>The log book of the cruiser shows that the commander obtained an
                            agreement signed by the master of the schooner “not to kill seals in
                            Russian waters.”</p>
                        <p>The question here is what the captain considered “Russian waters.” He
                            inscribed in the schooner’s log book that “he was seized in 54° 9′ north
                            latitude and 168° 21′ east longitude, though not exactly in Russian
                            waters;” that is to say, that Russia claimed jurisdiction over the
                            waters near the point where the seizure occurred, and which the
                            defendant party does not deny was more than 30 miles from the Russian
                            coasts. So it appears that the waters which are considered as belonging
                            to Russia were well beyond ordinary marine jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>It is quite probable that the report signed by the master of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> could be produced, and if it were
                            of a character calculated to refute the statements of the master of the
                            schooner it is difficult to <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0387"
                            />understand why it was not presented as evidence in the counter
                            memorandum. In fact, the latter is the document in the Russian language
                            which Captain Lutjens swore he was forced to sign, and which he did not
                            understand.</p>
                        <p>But the arbitrary act of the commander of the cruiser in confiscating
                            these skins on the grounds, as he himself said, that Lutjens could not
                            prove that he had not taken them within Russian waters, although he had
                            no reason for the supposition, showed the master of the schooner the
                            sort of treatment he might expect if he should again be overhauled by a
                            Russian cruiser.</p>
                        <p>It is not to be supposed that the owner and master of the vessel would
                            abandon his business in the middle of the season if he had been allowed
                            the liberty of continuing it. The testimony submitted in the memorandum
                            in support of the claims for the seizure of the <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis</hi>, Exhibit F of said case, again cited here, shows
                            plainly that Lutjens had no need to enter Russian jurisdictional waters
                            to carry on his business. The only reasonable explanation of the
                            abandonment of his voyage is found in his sworn declaration, viz, that
                            he was ordered by the commander of the Russian cruiser to “stop sealing
                            and go home.”</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the admission of the defendant party that an indemnity is due
                            for the seal skins confiscated by Captain de Livron constitutes a
                            distinct admission that the position taken by the latter that the onus
                            probandi that the skins were not taken in Russian waters—that is to say,
                            were not stolen—rests upon the master, is not tenable. It may be added
                            that an officer whose views of personal rights are such that he
                            considers one must prove that the goods in one’s possession are not
                            stolen in order to retain legitimate possession of them, would seem to
                            be capable of entertaining different views from other people on the
                            subject of navigating and fishing at sea.</p>
                        <p>The question of measuring the damages by loss of catch has been
                            considered in the memorandum as well as in the preamble of this
                            rejoinder to the counter memorandum.</p>
                        <p>The case of the defendant party must be considered as being entirely
                            presented, in view of the fact that the terms of the protocol do not
                            admit of the party claimant presenting new proofs.</p>
                        <p>The party claimant therefore rests in the firm belief that the honorable
                            arbitrator will in his award allow the total amount of indemnity
                            claimed.</p>

                            White, and Hate and Anna</hi>, has the honor to submit the following to
                        the honorable arbitrator, Mr. Asser:</p>
                    <p>In setting forth in its counter memorandum the condition of facts regarding
                        the reciprocal relations of the interested parties in the matter of the
                        protection of the seals at the time when the aforesaid cases occurred, the
                        defendant party called attention to the view that in this litigation it is
                        not alone the opinions of eminent writers on international law on the
                        subject of bordering marine jurisdiction which should be considered.</p>
                    <p>The defendant party believes itself all the more authorized to do this since
                        the rules of procedure in the arbitration agreed upon between the two
                        parties expressly stipulate that the arbitrator shall be governed in his
                        award not only by the general principles of international law but also by
                        the spirit of international agreements applicable to the subject. In the
                        opinion of the defendant party the opinions cited by the writers in question
                        have rather a theoretical bearing; but there are numerous cases where
                        governments in view of certain interests and of administrative
                        considerations have been obliged in special cases to recognize other
                        solutions of the question of marine jurisdiction. The Government of the
                        United States, the party claimant in the present action, has set up, with
                        regard to the right of jurisdiction in this same Bering Sea, claims
                        extending to much greater limits toward the British Government, as is shown
                        in the acts of the tribunal of arbitration of Paris of August 15, 1893. The
                        fact that the award of the tribunal did not recognize the legality of the
                        said claims does not imply that such was not then the opinion of the United
                        States on the subject of right of jurisdiction. In submitting in advance to
                        the decisions of the arbitrator in 1893, the American Government only
                        conformed to the attitude which each party takes when it resorts to
                        arbitration. It is this same attitude of deference to the decision of the
                        person chosen as arbitrator that the Imperial Government very naturally
                        takes also in the present case.</p>
                    <p>As to the precedents evoked in the successive memoranda of the party claimant
                        and which are invoked in support of the American demands the defendant party
                        believes it necessary to make it evident that they could only have a
                        consultative bearing. If one arbitrator in a given case renders his
                        decisions inspired by certain principles another arbitrator even in a
                        similar case may be guided by different views. In arbitrations
                        jurisprudence, having the same sanctioning force of law as the sentences of
                        the respective supreme courts in each country, does not exist. It is
                        possible that this may be up to a certain point the case <pb n="366"
                            xml:id="pg_366" facs="0392"/>in the future when the court of arbitration
                        at The Hague, recently instituted, may be called upon to pronounce in a
                        sufficient number of cases giving rise to litigation between governments on
                        contended questions. But, as at present, the awards of arbiters have not
                        been in any manner codified, and as each one of them has ruled on the view
                        of principles of equity which have seemed to him applicable to each
                        particular case, so in the present litigation the defendant party believes
                        that it is justified in demanding that the case of the American vessels in
                        question should be examined in the light of and taking into consideration
                        the special and very exceptional conditions of the question of the
                        protection of seals at the time when the seizures took place.</p>
                    <p>As in civil law, furthermore, recourse to arbitration is recourse to equity,
                        and it is therefore that the parties agree upon it to settle
                        difficulties.</p>
                    <p>Although this is no place to state the considerations of equity which may
                        have guided the tribunal of 1893, still it seems admissible to state that in
                        rightfully ruling against the pretensions of the United States to
                        jurisdiction over the eastern half of Bering Sea it admitted that in fact,
                        on a basis of agreement, this jurisdiction might be extended to 60 miles
                        from the American shores of the Pribilof Islands. There was here set forth
                        an exceptional situation. This gave, in a spirit of equity, a certain
                        satisfaction to the claims of the two parties responding to the local
                        necessities.</p>
                    <p>It is true that the present defendant party was not a participant in the
                        arbitration of 1893; it had not for its part claimed at that time a right of
                        jurisdiction over the western part of Bering Sea equal to that claimed by
                        the United States over the eastern half, but the United States then set up
                        the right of substitution, occupying the place of Russia which formerly,
                        when it still possessed both sides of the said sea, considered it as closed.
                        Russia had ceased to claim a right of total jurisdiction before even she
                        ceded the territory of Alaska to the United States. If the United States
                        obtained, as the result of the arbitration of 1893, the recognition of a
                        jurisdiction of 60 miles around the Pribilof Islands, is it in virtue of the
                        argument that Russia could not set up the claim for her part if she had
                        found it advantageous, since the situation in the eastern part of Bering Sea
                        is not analogous to that of the western part? The arbitration of 1893 only
                        admitted in favor of the United States the interdiction of sealing to the
                        extent of 60 miles around the American coasts in virtue of considerations
                        applicable to the entire sea—that is to say, to the Russian coasts as well
                        as to the American coasts—and not at all because of a special title of
                        America or of a different situation on the west coast than on the east
                        coast. On a basis that that had become its right as one emanating from that
                        of Russia, the present party claimant could only consider the right of the
                        Russian Government as at least equal to its own. The award of the tribunal
                        of 1893 took into consideration the exceptional situation of the American
                        Government with regard to the protection of its interests in the Bering Sea;
                        but the American Government, which took its stand on the ground of its
                        rights and which set forth the existence of the act of cession in 1867, was
                        not in a position to contest before 1893 that the right of Russia was
                        preexistent, and therefore that the Russian Government could not sustain on
                        her side the same pretensions.</p>
                    <p>Since the award of the tribunal of 1893 in the difference between England and
                        the United States was rendered (Exhibit A) Russia has <pb n="367"
                            xml:id="pg_367" facs="0393"/>not claimed for itself a jurisdiction of 60
                        miles around its shores in the Bering Sea as that recognized for the United
                        States. It had already taken, previous to this, certain measures, such as
                        sending Russian cruisers into these waters. As early as the year 1881 the
                        chief of administration of the Commander Islands had published in Japan a
                        notice stating the interdiction for the year 1882 of hunting sea animals in
                        the waters of eastern Siberia under pain of confiscation of vessels. A
                        similar notice was published at San Francisco to bring these measures to the
                        knowledge of Americans engaged in the said hunting.</p>
                    <p>But after an influx of English and American marauders in 1891, when, in
                        consequence of the arrangement of that year between the United States and
                        England, sealing in the eastern part of Bering Sea was interdicted, the
                        measures of protection by Russia were already reenforced. In 1892 the
                        Russian Government instituted a commission under the presidency of Privy
                        Counselor Kapoustine for the purpose of establishing the necessary measures
                        to prevent the extermination of the seals. The commission was inspired in
                        this respect by the principle of force majeure and the protection of the
                        legitimate interests of Russia. Without ignoring the utility of a subsequent
                        international arrangement, which it had on the contrary recommended, it was
                        of the opinion that it was necessary to take certain original measures to
                        interdict foreign vessels from sealing to the distance of 10 miles along the
                        Russian coast and 30 miles along the Commander Islands and the island of
                        Tuleni. The necessity of these two measures had become imperious because of
                        the very exceptional condition or situation caused to Russian industrial
                        companies engaged in sealing by the great number of Canadian and American
                        poaching vessels.</p>
                    <p>At the time when the commission published its notice—that is to say, January
                        17, 1893—the tribunal of arbitration of Paris had not yet rendered its
                        award. The United States maintained before that tribunal pretensions very
                        much greater with regard to marine jurisdiction, and the general attitude
                        taken by the American Government as regards the interest of the preservation
                        of seals did not admit of the doubt that it entertained the views advanced
                        by the Government of Russia and approved as minimum the measures taken by
                        the latter, if indeed it did not find them quite insufficient. The question
                        of fixing the right of jurisdiction of the United States was then in
                        suspense, and England, previous to the session of the commission of
                        Kapoustine, while taking the view that the jurisdiction of Russia in the
                        western part of Bering Sea only extended to strictly territorial waters,
                        recognized that the interdictions were in doubt as to the limits of the
                        extent of sea where sealing was interdicted by the Government of Russia.</p>
                    <p>The Imperial Government simply informed the British ambassador of the
                        decisions which it had taken following the notice of the commission of
                        Kapoustine, and the English Government declared its right to enter into an
                        agreement on this basis, and it was thus that it was concluded by an
                        exchange of notes in 1893 with England relative to the protection of seals
                        in the western part of Bering Sea; but at this time the exceptional
                        character of the situation was again brought by the Russian Government to
                        the attention of England by means of a declaration made simultaneously with
                        the exchange of notes that Russia did not intend to prejudge the right of a
                        state to extend bordering jurisdiction in certain special cases beyond the
                        limit of strictly territorial waters. As to the Cabinet of Washington when
                        it received the <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0394"/>communication of
                        the Anglo-Russian agreement, it seemed insufficient, in view of the general
                        interest of the protection of seals, since it demanded from the Russian
                        Government to suspend execution of the decision taken, since its publication
                        might have an unfortunate effect on the success of the claims presented to
                        the tribunal of arbitration of Paris by the Federal Government. As a result
                        of subsequent negotiations after the tribunal of Paris had already rendered
                        its award and other combinations for a general agreement on the subject were
                        put forward in succession, Russia concluded with the United States a similar
                        arrangement with that with Great Britain. This arrangement bears the date of
                        April 22 (May 4), 1894 (Exhibit B). The Russian Government, furthermore,
                        made to the United States before concluding this arrangement the same
                        reservations of principle as those made to England and which are mentioned
                        above.</p>
                    <p>The effects of diplomatic order or of Russian interior administrative order
                        which preceded the conclusion of the said arrangement are here set forth in
                        Annex 1 to the present surrejoinder.</p>
                    <p>Unquestionably the Russian Government does not invoke in the present
                        litigation the very letter of the arrangement of 1894, indeed article 5 of
                        the act in question excludes all possibility of giving it a retroactive
                        force in the literal sense of the term. In the course of the correspondence
                        exchanged between the two cabinets with relation to the seizure of the four
                        American vessels the Imperial Government has not acted on the ground of that
                        agreement, which was made previous to the seizure. At the present time also
                        as party defendant it limits itself to stating the situation of facts at
                        that time which by prolongation obliged the resort to force majeure and the
                        right of defense of legitimate interests; it also states that in 1891 and
                        1892 the United States partook entirely the Russian point of view on the
                        subject of exceptional measures for the preservation of the seals and set
                        forth to the British Government with regard to the protection of these
                        animals the arguments which the Russian Government invoked also on its part
                        except that the latter objected to the claim of jurisdiction over an entire
                        half of Bering Sea; the defendant party might therefore object to the party
                        claimant that who claims the most ought to recognize the lesser claims made
                        at the same time.</p>
                    <p>The defendant party states further that the Government of the United States
                        could not consider the western half of Bering Sea as being under different
                        conditions from the eastern half and it in the course of the negotiations
                        themselves offered to engage to apply to the western extent of the said sea
                        the conditions of the award of Paris with all its consequences. And it is
                        for these reasons that the party defendant believes that it may rest upon
                        the rights accorded to it by the awards of the arbitration of August 26
                        (September 8), 1900, making itself a party under those general principles of
                        international law which include equally force majeure and the right of
                        legitimate defense and in invoking the spirit if not the letter of
                        international agreements applicable to the subject this spirit extends to
                        the entire assembly of points on which basis is made manifest the solidarity
                        between the two Governments in the course of the development of this
                        question as it is related in Annex 1.</p>
                    <p>The condition of facts as they presented themselves at that time was as
                        follows: The two Governments had an equal interest in the efficacious and
                        energetic suppression of poaching. But there stood in the <pb n="369"
                            xml:id="pg_369" facs="0395"/>way of this suppression the extent of space
                        to patrol, the necessarily limited number of war vessels for the right of
                        capture, a number which even if it was augmented would never be able to be
                        entirely sufficient, finally the paucity of inhabitants of the shores. The
                        following is a list of Russian vessels of war charged with the services of
                        patrol in the western part of Bering. Sea from 1891 to 1895: The schooner
                            <hi rend="italic">Aleout</hi>, which left Vladivostok for that purpose
                        June 29, 1891, the cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaka</hi>, in 1892, the
                        cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaka</hi> and the transport <hi rend="italic"
                            >Vakout</hi> in 1893, the cruisers <hi rend="italic">Zabiaka</hi> and
                            <hi rend="italic">Razhoinik</hi>, as well as the transport <hi
                            rend="italic">Vakout</hi> in 1894 and the transport <hi rend="italic"
                            >Vakout</hi> in 1895.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the destructive action which the poaching vessels then
                        exercised the party defendant can not do better than to refer to the
                        exhibits presented by the Government of the United States to the tribunal of
                        arbitration of Paris; the considerations which they present with regard
                        especially to the mode of life of the seals which rendered it particularly
                        necessary to protect the females. The condition of facts as regards this
                        destructive action is even set forth in Annex 2 of the present
                        rejoinder.</p>
                    <p>It is indeed on the manner of life of the seals that the delegates of the
                        United States to the tribunal of arbitration of Paris in 1893 based a part
                        of their claim of the right of property of the American Government in these
                        animals whether within or without the limit of territorial waters. The award
                        of the tribunal did not admit this right, but in fact, as has been said
                        before, it look into account the peculiar situation of the United States.
                        This theory was formulated again in the brochure, which the American
                        delegates, Messrs. Morgan and Harlan, published on their return from the
                        tribunal of arbitration, and which contains an exposé of the points of view
                        held by them in the name of their Government. The brochure is entitled
                        Bering Sea Tribunal of Arbitration—Opinions of Mr. Justice Harlan and
                        Senator Morgan. Here is a résumé of these opinions:</p>
                    <p>The seal herds which frequent the islands of St. Paul and St. George in
                        Bering Sea when they have reached the ocean outside of the ordinary distance
                        of 3 miles from the coast constitute the property of the United States; and
                        when these animals, according to their natural habits, betake themselves to
                        the above-mentioned islands for the purpose of reproduction the United
                        States in their capacity of proprietors of these islands and of the animals
                        which occupy them have the right to apply for the defense of the seals,
                        against their capture at sea, measures, the application of which is the
                        right of private individuals, for the safe-guarding of their interests (pp.
                        186 and 204).</p>
                    <p>Independently of the right of property in the herds the United States in
                        their capacity as proprietors of the industry exercised by their authority
                        on the islands of St. Paul and St. George, and in virtue of the right of
                        self-protection, are justified in employing such measures, including force,
                        which may be necessary to prevent those acts which would result in the
                        inevitable rapid extermination of this race of animals forming the object of
                        that industry (p. 205).</p>
                    <p>In the second part of the brochure is found set forth the opinion developed
                        by Mr. Morgan before the tribunal and according to which the rights of the
                        United States with regard to the seals are the same as those formerly
                        enjoyed by Russia.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Morgan maintains that Russia has enjoyed its right of property with
                        regard to the seals, exercising supervision over them in Bering <pb n="370"
                            xml:id="pg_370" facs="0396"/>Sea and according to aliens certain
                        privileges for making profits from these animals (p. 52). The property of
                        the United States is established on the following basis: <list>
                            <item>First. The right existing ab initio and transmitted by Russia for
                                the act of the state and of its nationals.</item>
                            <item>Second. The right of making laws to provide for the internal
                                administration in a country without prejudice to the fact that the
                                seals quit the islands for a certain length of time to search for
                                food or even to pass later into the Pacific Ocean.</item>
                            <item>Third. The habits of the seals and their natural tendency, which
                                obliges them to go to the Pribilof Islands.</item>
                            <item>Fourth. The necessity of governmental supervision over the seals
                                to prevent their destruction. This supervision could not be
                                effectively exercised except by the State on the territory where the
                                animals are born and become its property resona.</item>
                            <item>Fifth. On the practical possession during ninety years (p.
                                55).</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances the party claimant can not contest that if it acts
                        in the present litigation as claimant in favor of certain of its citizens
                        the defendant party represents the rights and interests of the Russian
                        State, which, according to the theory maintained by the American delegates
                        at the tribunal of Paris, have been injured by the acts of the persons
                        engaged in hunting on the high seas, as shown in Annex 2. As is set forth in
                        the said annex the acts committed by these vessels have brought los upon the
                        concessionary Russian company in their rights in the seals of Commander
                        Islands, and consequently upon the Russian treasury, which has been obliged
                        to reduce in consequence the agreements entered into by the treasury with
                        that society.</p>
                    <p>The defendant party states that in the presence of the natural difficulties
                        which the business of preservation of the seals presents the Russian
                        Government has always believed that it should not add new obstacles by a too
                        narrow interpretation of the right of seizure under urgent conditions to
                        those already existing. In 1891 and 1892 there was need of immediate action,
                        and the very dispositions arrived at after the meeting of Kapoustine’s
                        commission were judged later to have been insufficient. The Russian
                        Government did not cease to call the attention of the British Government to
                        the necessity of a less narrow interpretation of the right of seizure, and
                        it could not be convinced that the Cabinet of Washington was inspired by
                        narrower principles in this interpretation.</p>
                    <p>The condition of facts at this time responded then entirely to the case of
                        force majeure and of legitimate defense, and if the arrangement of 1894
                        could not be considered as having literal and retroactive effect the Russian
                        Government, which had enunciated before the conclusion of this agreement its
                        reservation of principle to the American Government, had always insisted
                        that the entire preceding negotiations and the general understanding on the
                        subject in the case would be maintained.</p>
                    <p>When the Government of the United States brought up the question of indemnity
                        for the American vessels seized by the Russian cruisers for poaching, it was
                        this same spirit which the Russian Government invoked in the examination of
                        these cases. The Cabinet at Washington, in December, 1895, requested to be
                        informed as to what are the limits which the Russian Government claims for
                        right of jurisdiction <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0397"/>in the waters
                        of the Bering Sea. The imperial minister of foreign affairs, in a note dated
                        the 5th (17th) of January, 1896, replied that the right of jurisdiction
                        which Russia claimed is that stipulated in the arrangement of April 22 (May
                        4), 1894, concluded with the United States. No doubt the interest which the
                        American Government had for the repression of poaching as efficaciously as
                        possible, the minister of foreign affairs added, the United States itself
                        claimed before the tribunal of Paris a jurisdiction still wider.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It is true that the Imperial Government, as you will kindly note, was not
                            one of the parties between whom the differences submitted to arbitration
                            occurred; that is to say, England and the United States. It is none the
                            less justified in expecting that the Cabinet of Washington, which
                            maintained before the tribunal of arbitration the most liberal
                            doctrines, will not depart from those liberal views in the solution of
                            the affair of the arrest of the American vessels, to which allusion was
                            made in the foregoing note, although anterior to the agreement of
                            1894.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>The note concludes in invoking force majeure and the right of legitimate
                        defense in support of the seizures. (Exhibit C.)</p>
                    <p>It is this same spirit which inspired the previous communications, which the
                        Imperial Government again invoke in this present controversy.</p>
                    <p>The party claimant has alleged in its reply to the Russian counter memorandum
                        that the party defendant has maintained that the modus vivendi of 1891
                        between the United States and England was applicable to the present
                        arbitration. The party defendant stated that owing to the conclusion of this
                        modus vivendi there resulted a considerable influx of poaching vessels into
                        the western part of Bering sea, a circumstance which obliged it to reenforce
                        its measures of protection.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the question of damages again set forth in the abovementioned
                        response of the party claimant, the defendant party believes it its duty in
                        the first place to refer to the general considerations developed above
                        concerning the bearing of precedents in disputed questions submitted to
                        arbitration. Without reverting to the opinions with regard to damages in
                        certain previous arbitral decisions the defendant party renews the point of
                        the consideration of the views set up by it, viz, that in the business of
                        hunting the profits are entirely contingent. By its very essence and taken
                        in the most general sense, the product of the chase is res nullus and only
                        belongs to an individual when he is actually in possession of it; effective
                        possession is only recognized when the game has been killed. There are
                        doubtless preserved hunting grounds, and the state may take measures to
                        regulate hunting or fishing within the limits over which its rights extend;
                        but in the ordinary rule the ownership of a private individual only
                        commences with possession. According to the laws of different countries on
                        the subject, suppose that two hunters have followed the same wild boar; it
                        does not belong to one of them until he has effectively got possession of
                        it; it is not even sufficient in order to create property that he should
                        have wounded it. It seems, therefore, to the defendant party that since in
                        the matter of hunting there can only be property when there is actual
                        possession, there can only be indemnity by the deprivation of something
                        which belongs to another.</p>
                    <p>But if in general when it is a question of hunting living game without a
                        fixed establishment the animal ought to be regarded as res nullus, and
                        consequently its ownership is one acquired by an individual only when he has
                        killed it. In the special case of seals by the nature of their <pb n="372"
                            xml:id="pg_372" facs="0398"/>existence indemnity for indirect damages
                        seems still more inadmissible. The defendant party considers that in this
                        respect it may refer to the opinion cited before of Messrs. Morgan and
                        Harlan, who continued to consider, even after the arbitral award of 1893,
                        the seals as being the property of a state on the territory on which their
                        periodical establishment is. If account ought to be taken of this theory,
                        and in the present case the defendant party supposes that the party claimant
                        could not deny it, having formerly sustained it, the deprivation of
                        hypothetical profit resulting from the nontaking of that which in place of
                        being simply res null us and of not yet having in his possession, belonging,
                        indeed, to another state, which was obliged to preserve it, could not afford
                        basis of an indemnity.</p>
                    <p>The fact that the modus vivendi concluded between England and the United
                        States in 1892 admitted in case American claims on the subject, of wide
                        jurisdiction in Bering Sea should not be recognized as legitimate by the
                        tribunal at Paris the Federal Government should indemnify the subjects of
                        Great Britain for having abstained from hunting seals during the course of
                        the proceedings in arbitration does not appear to the defendant party as
                        applicable to the present case. In the first place, it was the question of
                        an interdiction of hunting from the entire eastern half of Bering Sea, which
                        constituted a prohibition and consequently an injury much greater caused to
                        the hunting industry and, further, it depended on the contracting States
                        within the limits determined to make a contract between themselves on the
                        subject of indemnity with obligations such as they judged fit. The defendant
                        party has made no engagement in this respect, and on this point it submits
                        itself to the equity of the arbitrator.</p>
                    <p>The party claimant bringing up again the bad treatment to which certain
                        officers and crews of vessels in question were submitted, the party
                        defendant deems it its duty to observe the following: At the date October 7
                        (19), 1891, the legation of the United States at St. Petersburg applied to
                        the imperial ministry to demand its intervention to lend assistance to the
                        captain of the American vessel, <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>,
                        who was in a very precarious situation at Vladivostok after his vessel had
                        been confiscated. (Exhibit D.) The minister of foreign affairs responded the
                        24th of October, the same year that the captain in question received for his
                        support a ruble and the sailors 50 kopeks per day, and necessary measures
                        had been taken provisionally by the local authorities in order that whatever
                        was necessary should not be wanting. (Exhibit E.) After the communication of
                        October, 1891, following the confiscation of the vessel, which took place in
                        July of the same year, and against which no protestation on the part of the
                        legation had been made at that time, the party claimant waited until July,
                        1894, to set up claims with regard to this seizure. It was then that the
                        affair took the character of a difference of a diplomatic nature, and the
                        correspondence with regard to it is to be found in the exhibits annexed to
                        the American memorandum. Without wishing to insist on the motives which may
                        have guided the Cabinet at Washington for deferring the presenting of its
                        claim it may be permissible to state that in November, 1892, as is stated in
                        Annex 1, the legation of the United States declared that the point of view
                        and of action of the Russian Government with regard to poaching vessels was
                        entirely conformable to the intentions and views of the Federal Government,
                        and it expressed the hope that Russia would maintain this ground. <pb

                        arbitration, as regards the point of bad treatment, we have on one hand the

                        character of which, leaving aside exceptions, is set forth in Annex 2, and

                    <p>The defendant party, in maintaining the principles serving as the basis of
                        the present arbitration, namely, the general principles of international
                        law, including the right of legitimate defense and the case of force majure,
                        which is the basis of the position taken by it, and furthermore the spirit
                        of international agreements applicable to the subject which in the course of
                        negotiations have marked the solidarity and conformity of the general views
                        between the United States and Russia in the question under consideration,
                        stating, moreover, that the party claimant on aceount of the attitude taken
                        by it formerly during and after the sittings of the Tribunal of Arbitration
                        of Paris, can not fail to recognize the analogy of the situation of facts in
                        the western half of Bering Sea and in the eastern half of the same sea; that
                        it has in effect recognized this analogy, and that it has even declared in
                        consequence, to the present defendant party, after the four cases of
                        seizure, that the point of view of the Russian Government in its action with
                        regard to poaching vessels was entirely conformable to the views of the
                        United States; believing that the broad spirit in the examination of the
                        case under consideration which the defendant party hoped to see manifest
                        itself later by the party claimant, found expression, on the part of the
                        defendant party, in the equitable character which the latter intended to
                        give to its recognition of the right of the claimant party to obtain on
                        certain points an indemnity, the amount of which is indicated in the Russian
                        counter memorandum, renews the opinion expressed in the said counter
                        memorandum, rejecting the other parts of the demands formulated in the
                        American memorandum, and again submits itself it this respect to the

                        <p>As to the first of the said five points, we, the said Baron de Courcel,
                            Mr. Justice Harlan, Lord Hannen, Sir John Thompson, Marquis Visconti
                            Venosta, and Mr. Gregers Gram, being a majority of the said arbitrators,
                            do decide and determine as follows:</p>
                        <p>By the ukase of 1821 Russia claimed jurisdiction in the sea now known as
                            the Bearing’s Sea, to the extent of 100 Italian miles from the coasts
                            and islands belonging to her, but in the course of the negociatrons
                            which led to the conclusion of the treaties of 1824 with the United
                            States and of 1825 with Great Britain, Russia admitted that her
                            jurisdiction in the said sea should be restricted to the reach of cannon
                            shot from shore, and it appears that, from that time up to the time of
                            the cession of Alaska to the United States, Russia never asserted in
                            fact or exercised any exclusive jurisdiction in Behring’s Sea or any
                            exclusive rights in the seal fisheries therein beyond the ordinary limit
                            of territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>As to the second of the said five points, we, the said Baron de Courcel,
                            Mr. Justice Harlan, Lord Hannen, Sir John Thompson, Marquis Visconti
                            Venosta, and Mr. Gregers Gram, being a majority of the said arbitrators,
                            do decide and determine that Great Britain did not recognize or concede
                            any claim upon the part of Russia to exclusive jurisdiction as to the
                            seal fisheries in Behring Sea, outside of ordinary territorial
                            waters.</p>
                        <p>As to the third of the said five points, as to so much thereof as
                            requires us to decide whether the body of water now known as the Behring
                            Sea was included in the phrase “Pacific Ocean” as used in the treaty of
                            1825 between Great Britain and Russia, we, the said arbitrators, do
                            unanimously decide and determine that the body of water now known as the
                            Behring Sea was included in the phrase “Pacific Ocean” as used in the
                            said treaty.</p>
                        <p>And as to so much of the said third point as requires us to decide what
                            rights, if any, in the Behring Sea were held and exclusively exercised
                            by Russia after the said treaty of 1825, we, the said Baron de Courcel,
                            Mr. Justice Harlan, Lord Hannen, Sir John Thompson, Marquis Visconti
                            Venosta, and Mr. Gregers Gram, being a majority of the said arbitrators,
                            do decide and determine that no exclusive rights of jurisdiction in
                            Behring Sea, and no exclusive rights as to the seal fisheries therein,
                            were held or exercised by Russia outside of ordinary territorial waters
                            after the treaty of 1825.</p>
                        <p>As to the fourth of the said five points, we, the said arbitrators, do
                            unanimously decide and determine that all the rights of Russia as to
                            jurisdiction and as to the seal fisheries in Behring Sea, east of the
                            water boundary, in the treaty between the United States and Russia of
                            the 30th March, 1867, did pass unimpaired to the United States under the
                            said treaty.</p>
                        <p>As to the fifth of the said five points, we, the said Baron de Courcel,
                            Lord Hannen, Sir John Thompson, Marquis Visconti Venosta, and M. Gregers
                            Gram, being a majority of the said arbitrators, do decide and determine
                            that the United States has not any right of protection or property in
                            the fur seals frequenting the islands of the United States in Behring
                            Sea, when such seals are found outside the ordinary three-mile
                            limit.</p>
                        <p>And whereas the aforesaid determination of the foregoing questions as to
                            the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States mentioned in Article VI
                            leaves the subject in such a position that the concurrence of Great
                            Britain is necessary to the establishment of regulations for the proper
                            protection and preservation of the fur seal in or habitually resorting
                            to the Behring Sea, the tribunal having decided by a majority as to each
                            article of the following regulations, we, the said Baron de Courcel,
                            Lord Hannen, Marquis Visconti Venosta, and Mr. Gregers Gram, assenting
                            to the whole of the nine articles of the following regulations, and
                            being a majority of the said arbitrators, do decide and determine, in
                            the mode provided by the treaty, that the following concurrent
                            regulations outside the jurisdictional limits of the respective
                            governments are necessary and that they should extend over the waters
                            hereinafter mentioned, that is to say:</p>

                                Affairs of Russia to the Minister of the United States of North
                                America at St. Petersburg, January</hi> 5, 1896, No. 49.</p>
                        <p>I have had the honor to receive your note of the 5th (17th) December,
                            1895, in which, by order of your Government, you ask to be informed what
                            are the limits over which the Imperial cabinet reserves unto itself the
                            right of jurisdiction in the waters of Bering Sea.</p>
                        <p>The Imperial Government, having entered upon an agreement with that of
                            the United States under date of April 22 (4th May), 1894, fixing at 10
                            maritime miles along the Russian coast, and at 30 miles around the
                            Commander and Tulienew islands as the prohibited zone for fur-seal
                            fishing, the determination of the limits within which the Russian
                            Government reserves the right of jurisdiction in this matter can only
                            conform with the stipulations of the agreement now in force.</p>
                        <p>The point of view which the Imperial Government has not ceased to take in
                            this affair has always been that of the interest it has in suppressing
                            in a manner as efficacious as possible illegal fur-sealing in the
                            immediate neighborhood of Russian possessions; and we do not doubt that
                            the United States Government is equally impressed with the necessity for
                            that suppression, because the abuses of that industry might result so
                            prejudicially for all of the countries interested in the complete
                            destruction of that race of animals.</p>
                        <p>Before the arbitration tribunal of Paris, of which mention is made in the
                            aforesaid note, the United States has even claimed a right of
                            jurisdiction still more extended.</p>
                        <p>If it is true that the Imperial Government, as you will kindly note, was
                            not one of the parties between whom arose the difference submitted to
                            arbitration—that is to say, England and the United States—it is no less
                            justified in expecting that the Cabinet at Washington which sustained
                            before the arbitration tribunal the broadest doctrines will not depart
                            from those broad views in the solution of the affairs of the seizure of
                            American vessels to which allusion is made in the aforesaid note,
                            although previous to the conclusion of the agreement of 1894.</p>
                        <p>We are convinced that the Federal Government, in view of the principles
                            which it sustained before the arbitration tribunal of Paris, will
                            recognize the case of force majeure and the right of legitimate defense,
                            in virtue of which the vessels engaged in destructive sealing within the
                            zone of 30 miles around Commander Islands were captured—rights which the
                            United States did not hesitate to sanction later by a dual
                            agreement.</p>

                            purpose of the necessary suppression.</p>
                        <p>In the month of September of the year 1892, the legation of the United
                            States at St. Petersburg, on the occasion of the assemblage of the
                            tribunal of arbitration of Paris, made known to the Imperial Government

                                the American minister made the verbal declaration aforesaid.</note>
                            expressed, in the name of the Cabinet of Washington, the hope that
                            Russia would maintain her own manner of viewing and acting with regard
                            to poaching vessels hunting seals in Russian waters, which entirely
                            conformed to the views and intentions of the Federal Government. In case
                            Russia thought of modifying its point of view, the Federal Government
                            asked that these modifications should not be made until after the award
                            of the tribunal of Paris.</p>
                        <p>At the same time the English embassy on the 11th (23d) January, 1893, in
                            accordance with the request of the Canadian sealers to know what were
                            the limits of the prohibited zone during the season of 1893, expressed
                            to the Russian Government the desire to know if it would be inconvenient
                            to inform these sealers that to the west of the line of demarcation of
                            1867 sealing is prohibited only to the strict limit of Russian
                            territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>These circumstances obliged the Russian Government to enter into a
                            detailed examination of the questions which had been brought up with
                            regard to the protection of the seal species in the western part of
                            Bering Sea. After having given to the American legation every assurance
                            on the subject of the absence of any intention on the part of Russia to
                            modify its views concerning the suppression of poaching, the ministry of
                            foreign affairs judged the occasion fit to submit the request of the
                            English embassy to the consideration of a special commission to be
                            charged with the determination of what measures were necessary to
                            prevent the future total destruction of these precious animals through
                            illegal hunting of the seals.</p>
                        <p>This commission was instituted by imperial order under the presidency of
                            Privy Counselor Kapoustine. It was also called upon to examine the
                            claims presented by the English embassy on the subject of the seizure by
                            Russian cruisers of vessels sailing under the British flag during the
                            hunting season of 1892.<note n="b" xml:id="d33fn2">The Government of the
                                United States had at that time brought no claim for arrests of
                                American vessels in 1891 and 1892.</note> The said commission in its
                            seance of January 17, 1893, arrived at the conclusion that the best
                            means of assuring proper regulation of sealing would be to have resort
                            to an international agreement which should determine the place, time,
                            and conditions of hunting. However, in view of the approaching
                            commencement of the sealing season, the commission deemed it necessary
                            that the Imperial Government should take urgent preservative measures,
                            and to this end to interdict to all foreign vessels hunting seals for a
                            distance of 10 miles along the Russian coasts and 30 miles around the
                            Commander and Tuleny islands. In support of the necessity of these
                            measures the following circumstances were brought forward: The
                            convention of 1891 between the United States and England had created for
                            Russians engaged in sealing a situation unusual and most unfavorable to
                            the interests of Russia; thus among the number of seal skins confiscated
                            by Russian cruisers in 1891 and 1892 there was an average of 95 per cent
                            of females. This circumstance sufficed to show that the poaching was
                            committed within Russian territorial waters, since the females, during
                            the period of reproduction, <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0410"
                            />corresponding to that of the sealing, did not absent themselves much
                            from the shores. The establishment of a zone of 30 miles was explained
                            by the necessity of preserving the seals during their excursions seaward
                            in search of nourishment in the depths called the “sealing grounds,” and
                            which are at a certain distance from the islands. The commission was of
                            the opinion that the measures proposed, by it were not contrary to the
                            general principles of international law, since they had a character
                            essentially provisional and were justified by the rule of “force majeure
                            and legitimate defense.” In conclusion, the commission proposed to
                            furnish the cruisers with identical instructions, and to authorize them
                            to chase and search poaching schooners which they might sight in Russian
                            waters, but which, being chased, might reach the high seas. In the
                            second place, to promulgate a special law establishing the civil and
                            criminal responsibility of persons engaged in illegal sealing; and
                            lastly, to send a sufficient number of cruisers to protect the Russian
                            industry and to organize in it a system of armed inspection on the
                            islands themselves.</p>
                        <p>The commission further expressed the opinion that the British Government
                            should be informed of such of the measures as it should be deemed
                            expedient to make known to it, in order that it might lend its
                            assistance toward their execution by duly warning the Canadian sealers
                            that they should conform to the rules. Finally, the commission judged it
                            well to invite the participation of Japan in the negotiations with
                            England and the United States on the subject of the preservation of the
                            seals because of the special fact of the passage of the animals between
                            the Japanese and Russian coasts.</p>
                        <p>The decisions of the Kapoustine commission having been duly sanctioned,
                            the ministry of foreign affairs on February 12, 1893 (Exhibit A),
                            informed the English embassy of the resolution taken by the Imperial
                            Government to forbid sealing for an extent of 10 miles from the Russian
                            coasts and within a zone of 30 miles around the Commander Islands. On
                            this occasion the considerations in question set forth by the commission
                            and which actuated these measures were brought to the attention of the
                            embassy. The Russian Government stated distinctly the following: “The
                            insufficiency of a strict application in this relation of the general
                            rules of international law relative to territorial waters was shown by
                            the very fact of negotiations having been opened since 1887 between the
                            three powers principally interested, to the end of agreeing upon special
                            and exceptional measures. The necessity of such measures was confirmed
                            by the Anglo-American agreement of 1891. In entering into these pour
                            parlers and this agreement the British Government had itself admitted
                            the expediency of an eventual modification of the general rules of
                            international law.”</p>
                        <p>The Cabinet of Washington having been informed of these measures through
                            the medium of its representative at St. Petersburg, to whom a copy of
                            the aforesaid note was communicated, the American legation requested the
                            Russian Government to suspend the execution of the measures, since their
                            publication might have an unfortunate effect upon the success of the
                            claims submitted to the tribunal of arbitration at Paris by the Federal
                            Government (Exhibit 6.) A telegram received from the Russian minister at
                            Washington informed the Imperial Government that the Secretary of State
                            of the American Union shared the same opinion. The Federal Government
                            did not, however, make any formal proposition as to the course to be
                            pursued in the affair; meantime the ministry of foreign affairs received
                            the reply of the British embassy dated 9th (21st) March, 1893; after a
                            new note from the Russian Government, dated April 6, 1893 (Exhibit C),
                            the agreement was entered into between the two cabinets; and it is thus
                            that the arrangement with England on this subject was concluded, in May,
                            1893. It was formulated in an exchange of notes between the minister of
                            foreign affairs and the British embassy, the one of May 10 (22), 1893,
                            No. 175, the other of May 18 (30) of the same year.</p>
                        <p>In concluding this agreement, however, the Russian Government deemed it
                            necessary to make certain reserves of principle—notably, that in
                            consenting to put the vessels infringing this interdiction at the
                            disposal of the British authorities the Government did not mean in any
                            way to prejudice the question of right of a bordering State to extend
                            its jurisdiction in certain special cases beyond territorial waters
                            taken in their restricted sense; in the second place the Russian
                            Government reserved to itself for the future every latitude of choice of
                            any system of preservation of the seals, and, finally, that the
                            arrangement in question should not in any way serve as a precedent and
                            should have an exclusively provisional character. (Note of the Imperial
                            ministry of foreign affairs to the British embassy, dated May 10, 1893,
                            Exhibit D D.)</p>
                        <p>With the same object of preservation, and on the basis of the decision of
                            the Kapoustine commission, the Russian Government modified and
                            supplemented some legislative measures concerning sealing. A notice of
                            the counsel of the Empire, clothed with the supreme sanction June 1,
                            1893, established the necessary measures in this respect.</p>
                        <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0411"/>
                        <p>On August 15, 1893, the tribunal of arbitration at Paris pronounced its
                            award in the litigation pending between England and the United States.
                            The decision, which did not sustain the pretentions of the United
                            States, could not naturally have been favorably received by the American
                            public. Although the English point of view had prevailed, as the
                            decision was to a certain extent a compromise, the limitations of the
                            right of sealing caused, also, a certain discontent in Canada.</p>
                        <p>The States participating in the arbitration of Paris were under
                            obligations to take, by the terms of the decision, legislative, measures
                            and the negotiations between the cabinets of London and Washington were
                            continued.</p>
                        <p>The Russian Government, for its part, was interested in the question
                            whether the provisions of the award of the Paris tribunal might not
                            properly be extended to the western portion of Bering Sea. Overtures to
                            this end had been made to the Russian Government by the Cabinet of
                            Washington, which believed it equally desirable to induce Japan to
                            participate in this agreement. The Government of the United States
                            finally decided, however, that it was better to await the conclusion of
                            its own negotiations with England, free to adopt the rules which should
                            be worked out in concert with that power as a basis of a more extended
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>However, as the arrangement concluded between Russia and England
                            approached its expiration, ths Russian Government was obliged to study
                            under what conditions the said arrangement had in practice been applied
                            during the year 1893, and what measures should be taken for the future.
                            It was shown that the prohibited zone of 30 miles protected in some
                            measure the seals which had succeeded in passing the line where the
                            poachers were stationed, but abandoned to the latter the herds of
                            animals which pass the month of June and part of July on what is called
                            the “sealing grounds” as well as the whole of them when they betake
                            themselves to the places where they resort from February till June; in
                            this respect the 30-mile zone was insufficient and the only result had
                            been to modify the methods the poachers, who continued to engage in
                            their industry, less no doubt in the proximity of the islands, but quite
                            as much on the high seas in the places where the seals fed. It was
                            further recognized that the arrangement with England was paralyzed by
                            the fact that America was not included in it. While recognizing the
                            importance of concluding as soon as possible an arrangement with the
                            cabinets of London and Washington on the basis of the provisions of the
                            award of the Paris tribunal, including in it those rules which might be
                            worked out later between the United States and England, and inviting
                            Japan to participate, still, as these negotiations might be prolonged it
                            was necessary to renew the arrangement actually existing with the
                            English Government, but without giving it a term and to proceed to the
                            conclusion of a similar arrangement with the Ameriean Government.</p>
                        <p>It is thus that the arrangement of 1893 with England was renewed, by an
                            exchange of notes between the ministry of foreign affairs and the
                            British embassy dated December 11 (23), 1893, No. 4338, and December 29
                            (January 10), 1893 (1894). No term was put to this agreement which
                            should remain in force until further notice. At the same time
                            negotiations were entered into with the United States for the conclusion
                            of a similar agreement. On February 8, 1894, the ministry of foreign
                            affairs addressed a note to this effect to the American legation.
                            (Exhibit C.) The Imperial Government therein expressed the conviction
                            that the Federal Government having always professed the broadest and the
                            most equitable views in regard to the protection of the legitimate seal
                            industry, would adhere to the proposition under consideration. In its
                            reply dated March 8, 1894 (Exhibit F F), the American legation stated
                            that the Government of the United States recognized with pleasure the
                            cordial character of the Russian proposition testifying to the desire of
                            the Imperial Government to arrive at an equitable and lasting agreement
                            on the subject. The dispatch addressed by the Department of State to the
                            American minister at St. Petersburg, dated March 30, and which was
                            transmitted to the Imperial Government, was conceived in the same
                            spirit. (Exhibit G G.)</p>
                        <p>Before proceeding to the signature of the arrangement with the United
                            States relative to the prohibition of the seals, the Imperial Government
                            deemed it necessary to formulate to the American Government the same
                            reserves of principle as to England. It is thus that the minister of
                            foreign affairs transmitted to the legation of the United States at St.
                            Petersburg the note dated March 21 (April 2), 1894, containing these
                            reserves. (Exhibit H H.) They were thus expressed: First. It is
                            understoon in the first place that the understanding arrived at between
                            our two governments leaves intact all the rights of Russia in its
                            territorial waters. Second. In delivering to the authorities of the
                            United States the American ships engaged in sealing within the
                            prohibited waters, we do not at all mean to prejudice the question of
                            the right of a bordering power to extend its territorial jurisdiction in
                            certain special cases beyond territorial waters, strictly so called.
                            Third. The Imperial Government reserves its entire liberty of action as
                            to choice in the future between the two systems of protection <pb
                                n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0412"/>of the fur seals, either by a
                            prohibited zone or by a completed interdiction of pelagic sealing or its
                            regulation on the high seas. Fourth. The present arrangement shall be in
                            force only until further notice. It shall possess only a provisional
                            character and shall in no sense serve as a precedent.</p>
                        <p>The arrangement was signed at Washington April 22 (May 4), 1894.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime the Imperial Government declared itself ready to enter
                            into negotiations for the conclusion, in concert with England and Japan,
                            of a general agreement looking to the protection of the seals in the
                            limits of the extent of sea north of latitude 35° on the basis indicated
                            by the award of the tribunal of Paris. A written communication in this
                            sense was addressed by the Russian minister at Washington to the Federal
                            Government. The negotiations relative to an agreement of this nature are
                            not terminated.</p>

                            practice their industry, the British Government proposed to reply to
                            them that sealing would remain until further order completely
                            interdicted within the limits of the line of demarcation agreed upon in
                            1891 between England and the United States of America, but that they
                            were at liberty beyond those limits, except the Russian territorial
                            waters.</p>
                        <p>At the same time your excellency asked me to communicate to him the
                            eventual objections which the Imperial Government might be disposed to
                            make to this statement.</p>
                        <p>Thanking you, Mr. Ambassador, for the manner in which the Imperial
                            Government takes action, I hasten to inform you that the question of
                            measures to be taken to prevent the destruction of the seals having been
                            for some time the subject of investigation, I have had to await the
                            preliminary results of that work before replying to the note which you
                            were good enough to address to me.</p>
                        <p>In touching to-day upon the question of sealing, I believe I should first
                            call your excellency’s attention to the fact that the insufficiency of
                            the strict application of general rules of international law, relative
                            to territorial waters, has been demonstrated by the very fact of the
                            negotiations opened since 1887 between the three powers principally
                            interested, to the end that special and exceptional measures be agreed
                            upon.</p>
                        <p>The necessity for such measures has since been confirmed by the
                            Anglo-American agreement established in 1891.</p>
                        <p>In lending itself to these pourparlers and to that agreement the British
                            Government itself admitted the occasion for a contingent abrogation of
                            the general rules of international law.</p>
                        <p>One point to which it would be well to call particularly the attention of
                            the British Government is that of the absolutely abnormal and
                            exceptional situation created for Russian interests by the
                            Anglo-American stipulations. In fact the prohibition of sealing within
                            the limits drawn by the modus vivendi agreed upon in 1891 had the effect
                            of increasing the destruction of seals on the Russian coasts in such
                            proportion that the complete disappearance of the species was only a
                            question of a short time unless efficacious measures for their
                            protection were taken without delay.</p>
                        <p>The following figures demonstrate this clearly:</p>
                        <p>The number of seals to be killed annually being fixed by the
                            administration proportionately to their quantity the years 1889 and
                            1890, before the establishment of the modus vivendi (Anglo-American),
                            gave the number of 55,915 and 56,833, while for the years 1891 and 1892,
                            after the above-mentioned understanding, these figures fell to 30,698
                            and 31,315. Moreover, according to the statistical data which the
                            Imperial Government was able to procure, the quantity of seal skins of
                            Russian production delivered to the London market increased during these
                            two years in an infinitely greater degree. The number of vessels engaged
                            in sealing and seen about the neighborhood of Commander and Tulienew
                            (Robin Island) must also have increased considerably, according to the
                            observations made by the local administration. The savage and lawless
                            methods of these traders are shown by the fact that of the seizures made
                            more than 90 per cent of the skins carried off by them are the skins of
                            females, which seldom go to any distance from the coast during the
                            sealing season, and the destruction of which entails that of all the
                            young they may be <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0413"/>suckling. The
                            number of seals wounded and abandoned on the shore or in the territorial
                            waters and afterwards found by the local authorities also testify to the
                            destructive character of the sealing.</p>
                        <p>In such a state of things we believe ourselves justified, Mr. Ambassador,
                            in expressing pur entire confidence in that the British Government will
                            admit the urgency for restrictive measures until an international
                            regulation of sealing can be established by an agreement between the
                            principally interested powers.</p>
                        <p>The Imperial Government, on its part, does not hesitate to acknowledge
                            that the protection can not be brought about in any really efficacious
                            manner until after such agreement.</p>
                        <p>Therefore it is disposed from this moment to enter into a conference to
                            that end with the Governments of Great Britain and the United States of
                            America; but it recognizes at the same time the absolute necessity for
                            immediate provisory measures, as much on account of the proximity of the
                            sealing season as to be in ample time to answer to the question asked in
                            your excellency’s letter of 11th (23d) January.</p>
                        <p>To that effect and after a minute examination the Imperial Government
                            believed it necessary to draw up the following measures which would be
                            applicable for the year 1893: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Sealing will be prohibited for all vessels not furnished with
                                    a special permit, to a distance of 10 miles along all of the
                                    seacoast belonging to Russia.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>This prohibited zone will be 30 miles around the Commander and
                                    Tulienew (Robin Island) according to the Russian official
                                    charts, which implies the closing for sealing vessels the
                                    straits between the Commander Islands.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>These measures shall be justified, with regard to the zone of 10 miles
                            along the seacoast, from the fact that vessels engaged in sealing
                            station themselves generally at a distance of from 7 to 9 miles from the
                            coast, while their boats and their crews engage in sealing as often on
                            the coast itself as in the territorial waters; as soon as a cruiser, is
                            sighted from afar, the vessels spread sails and endeavoring to recall
                            their crew, sail away beyond territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the zone of 30 miles around the islands, this measure is
                            prompted by the necessity of protecting the banks designated by sealers
                            as “sealing grounds” which are found around the islands, and are not
                            sufficiently distinct upon the charts. These banks serve at certain
                            seasons, as stations for the females, the killing of which is
                            particularly destructive to the seal race at the time of year when the
                            females tend their young or go to seek their own food on the banks
                            called “sealing grounds.”</p>
                        <p>Praying you, Mr. Ambassador, to bring the foregoing to the knowledge of
                            the British Government, I believe it well to insist upon the essentially
                            provisory character of the above-mentioned measures, which are delayed
                            by an exceptional press of circumstances known as a case of force majure
                            and similar to the case of legitimate defense.</p>
                        <p>Be it understood that in no way does it enter into the intention of the
                            Imperial Government to dispute the rules generally acknowledged with
                            regard to territorial waters. In its opinion, far from infringing the
                            general principles of international law the measures it believes
                            necessary to take, should on the contrary prove them as the exception
                            proves the rule.</p>
                        <p>The weight of the arguments hereinbefore set forth will certainly not
                            escape the enlightened appreciation of the British Government and I am
                            firmly confident that it will not refuse to take steps with regard to
                            the English vessels engaged in sealing, in conformity with the measures
                            which the Imperial Government proposes to take for the year 1893.</p>
                        <p>For its part the Imperial Government will not fail to give to these
                            measures in ample time the publicity they require.</p>
                        <p>Moreover in order to avoid as far as possible misunderstandings and
                            contentions in case of infraction of the aforesaid provisory measures as
                            well as of the general principles of international law, cruisers will be
                            furnished with precise instructions clearly defining the cases wherein
                            the right to pursue, to inspect, and to seize offending vessels should
                            be exercised.</p>
                        <p>As has been stated, while remaining outside territorial waters and
                            sometimes even at a distance exceeding 10 miles, the vessels engaged in
                            sealing send a portion of their crew and their boats even to the coasts
                            of territorial waters or nearly so; it will be prescribed in the
                            above-mentioned instructions to pursue and to subject to inspection all
                            vessels whose passengers or crew may have been seen or taken while
                            engaged in sealing on the coast or within the zone prohibited by the
                            provisory measures for the year 1893.</p>
                        <p>A strong presumption resulting from the fact of the presence of the crews
                            near the coasts in the prohibited zone, even when at first it might be
                            impossible to state whether or not these crews had engaged in sealing,
                            it will be lawful to pursue and subject to inspection all vessels to
                            which such crews belonged.</p>
                        <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0414"/>
                        <p>The seizure on vessels subjected to search of instruments specially used
                            in sealing, even on land, as well as of seal skins of which the greater
                            number might be skins of females, would constitute sufficient reasons
                            for the seizure of the vessel since the female seals seldom go more than
                            10 miles from the shore (excepting to the banks situated around the
                            islands) during the time they are tending their young.</p>
                        <p>In informing the captains of vessels destined for sailing of the
                            provisory measures set forth for the year 1893, the British Government
                            may perhaps deem it well to acquaint them also with the emphatic tenor
                            of the instructions with which the Russian cruisers will be provided, by
                            adding that the right of surveillance will be equally given to coast
                            vessels upon whose mainmasts the governor of the Commander Islands will
                            hoist the customs flag of Russia when he is aboard in the exercise of
                            his duty.</p>
                        <p>Please accept, etc.</p>

                        <p>We have learned with deepest disappointment of the proposals shown by our
                            investigations. For the protection of seals a 30-mile zone utterly
                            inadequate. Agreement for this season between the United States and
                            Great Britain prohibits sealing for hundreds of miles around seal
                            islands in Bering Sea. If the agreement proposed by Russia is perfected
                            and given to the public, it will greatly prejudice our claim before the
                            tribunal of arbitration. The decision of the tribunal can not long be
                            deferred, and I hope you will be able to delay definite action until
                            after the decision has been made. We are most hopeful of securing
                            decision insuring most satisfactory protection, provided Russia does not

                                Petersburg, dated April</hi> 6, 1893, No. 1188.</p>
                        <p>In reply to my note of February 12 (24) your excellency had the goodness
                            to send me a copy of Lord Roseberry’s dispatch, dated March 17, by which
                            the British Government proposes to establish immediately a “modus
                            vivendi” on the following basis: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The British Government to interdict its subjects from sealing
                                    within the zones of 30 and 10 miles, and to offer the
                                    cooperation of its cruisers for the execution of this measure.
                                    The Imperial Government to engage itself to deliver to the
                                    English cruisers or to the nearest British authority the English
                                    ships captured outside of territorial waters within the
                                    above-mentioned zones, while the English cruisers shall
                                    reciprocally deliver the captured Russian ships under similar
                                    conditions.</item>

                                <item>The Imperial Government to limit to a fixed number the
                                    quantity of seals which are to be killed on the islands.</item>

                                <item>The Imperial Government to authorize an agent of the British
                                    Government to go to the islands to confer with the local
                                    authorities as to the working and result of the
                                    arrangement.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>It is to be understood that the arrangement shall in no wise
                                    affect the privilege hitherto accorded to English ships of
                                    refuge, repairs, or provisioning in Russian ports.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>The arrangement to have no retroactive force—more particularly
                                    as regards English ships captured during the past year.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I could not enter on the subject, Mr. Ambassador, without previously
                            having called your attention to the fact that my note of February 12
                            (24) was intended to notify the British Government of certain measures
                            of legitimate defense made provisionally necessary by exceptional
                            circumstances and not to propose a basis for a “modus vivendi,” properly
                            so-called; that is to say, for a dual agreement susceptible of being
                            prolonged until the question should be definitely settled.</p>
                        <p>It is simply a question of the minimum of protective measures necessary
                            to prevent the extinction of the object of the discussion even before
                            the opening of negotiations on the subject.</p>
                        <p>In view of the proximity of the sealing season, now already opened, the
                            Imperial Government estimated that on the date of my note there would
                            not be time to consider and draw up a “modus vivendi” which must
                            necessarily touch not only upon questions of interest but also on
                            questions of principle.</p>
                        <p>If it had intended to propose a basis for such a “modus vivendi,” the
                            Imperial Government would not have failed to maintain that a restriction
                            of territorial rights—that is to say, the engagement to limit the number
                            of seals to be killed on land—ought equitably to have as corollary the
                            complete suspension of pelagic hunting on the open sea. It would, above
                            all, have believed it indispensable to make reserves as regards the
                            definite settlement of the question of the seals for the purpose of
                            safeguarding its entire liberty of estimating the measures necessary for
                            the preservation of the seals, either by the prohibition or regulation
                            of hunting on the open seas or by the extension of special rights of
                            protection of the species outside of the various distances commonly
                            designated as the limit of territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>However, having made these observations, I am authorized, Mr. Ambassador,
                            to inform your excellency that the Imperial Government, being desirous
                            of meeting any conciliatory proposition of the British Government, is
                            prepared to accept that which is made in Lord Roseberry’s dispatch,
                            except for some modifications of the first point.</p>
                        <p>Thus the Imperial Government would be disposed to limit for the current
                            year the number of seals to be killed on the islands to 30,000, thus
                            reducing by 20,000 the average number of 50,000, provided for in its
                            contract with the industrial company.</p>
                        <p>It would not object to an agent of the British Government going to the
                            islands to interview the local authorities and to gather from them
                            information as to the operation and results of the arrangement. The time
                            and place of this visit should naturally be previously fixed.</p>
                        <p>There would not be, of course, any modification of the facilities enjoyed
                            by English ships of refuge, repair or provisioning in Russian ports.</p>
                        <p>The arrangement agreed on would have no retroactive force, since the
                            different cases of capture made during the past year have already been
                            examined by a commission ad hoc on the basis of the general principles
                            of international law.</p>
                        <p>Finally, as for the first point of the proposition contained in Lord
                            Roseberry’s dispatch, the Imperial Government is of the opinion that it
                            would hardly be possible to apply it in its entirety, at least under the
                            conditions named for the present hunting season, notably as to the
                            engagement to deliver to English cruisers or to the nearest English
                            authority the English ships taken in contravention outside of
                            territorial waters within the prohibited zones of 30 and 10 miles.</p>
                        <p>It might be possible later to find a ground of mutual agreement to meet
                            the practical objections which such an arrangement presents; but at the
                            moment it is beyond a doubt that it would completely paralyze the action
                            of the cruisers of the Imperial navy and render futile the supervision
                            which they must exercise along the coast and around the islands.</p>
                        <p>In fact every Russian cruiser which might capture an English ship would
                            be confronted with the alternative of either to hunt for an English
                            cruiser, which might take a long time, in view of the extent of coast,
                            or to undertake a voyage of 3,000 miles to conduct the captured vessel
                            to the nearest port, that of Victoria in Columbia.</p>
                        <p>The Russian cruisers would thus be exclusively occupied in hunting for
                            the English cruisers or in making the voyage to the port of Victoria and
                            return during the entire sealing season, and the “cooperation” of the
                            cruisers of the two nations would become only nominal.</p>
                        <p>In this condition of affairs, and not pausing for the moment on another
                            essential point—that of absolute want of reciprocity in the British
                            proposition, in view of the <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0416"
                            />fact that there are not and could not be vessels under the Russian
                            flag engaged in sealing—the Imperial Government deems that for the
                            current year it will be simpler and more practical to leave the newly
                            prohibited zones, as in the case of territorial waters, to the exclusive
                            supervision of the cruiser of the Imperial navy, which will continue,
                            until a final arrangement is arrived at, to conduct all vessels arrested
                            in contravention to Petropavlorsk.</p>
                        <p>In accepting four out of five points of the English proposition, and in
                            only objecting to the full and immediate application of the fifth, the
                            Imperial Government believes that it has proved its sincere desire to
                            see the pending pourparlers result in an agreement sufficiently for its
                            partial objection, based on purely geographical considerations, not to
                            be interpreted as an act of distrust.</p>
                        <p>If the British Government on its part accepts, as I confidently hope it
                            will, the proposal of a “modus agendi” set forth above, one could
                            consider all eventual complications for the current sealing season as
                            being disposed of, and, furthermore, the necessary time for agreeing
                            upon a more definite “modus vivendi” would be gained.</p>
                        <p>Please to accept, etc.,</p>

                        <p>In reply to your communication of April 30 (May 12), I have the honor to
                            inform you that the Imperial Government, while accepting the proposed
                            agreement annexed to that communication, prefers to give it the
                            character of an exchange of notes for the reasons following:</p>
                        <p>Because the too concise wording of the above-mentioned project would
                            leave the way open to certain misunderstandings and perhaps even to
                            complications which it would be desirable to avoid.</p>
                        <p>Because the Imperial Government could not adhere to the project in
                            question without some reservations for the purpose of securing to itself
                            the liberty of action in the future.</p>
                        <p>It is well understood that the agreement to be established between our
                            two Governments will leave intact all of Russia’s rights in its
                            territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>With regard to our reservations, they will bear upon the

                                    complete prohibition of pelagic sealing or of its regulation on

                        <p>In continuation of the verbal overtures which the Imperial minister of
                            foreign affairs has already made by your interposition relative to the
                            conclusion with the United States of America of an agreement similar to
                            the one which exists between Russia and Great Britain with regard to the
                            hunting of fur seals, it is my duty to address the present note to you
                            with the request that you will be kind enough to inform us of the
                            decision of the United States Government in this regard.</p>
                        <p>You are doubtless not unaware that the agreement with England relative to
                            the hunting of fur seals, concluded by the Imperial Government last
                            year, had for its object the ending of annoying differences which
                            frequently arose in consequence of the confiscation of English vessels
                            engaged in illicit sealing in Russian waters.</p>
                        <p>Differences of this sort might arise with the United States of America
                            relating to vessels engaged in this same prohibited industry under the
                            American flag. It would be very desirable to prevent these, or at least
                            to regulate beforehand the manner of legal procedure by means of a
                            friendly understanding that the law interdicting all unauthorized
                            hunting or fishing in our waters has been lately enforced and rendered
                            more strict by new arguments. The Federal Government, besides, having
                            always professed the broadest and most equitable principles with regard
                            to fur sealing, we do not doubt that it will accept our present
                            proposition.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to join herewith copy of the notes of the Imperial
                            Government and of the British chargé d’affaires at St. Petersburg, the
                            exchange of which constituted the agreement arrived at between us and
                            Great Britain in the question of fur sealing.</p>
                        <p>The application of that agreement will require but a few supplementary
                            modifications with regard to the means of carrying out the projects,
                            concerning which it will not be difficult to agree.</p>

                            possible, on account of the approach of the season in which sealing is

                                Affairs of Russia, dated March</hi> 9 (21), 1894.</p>
                        <p>Referring to your note of February 8 (o. s.), 1894, I duly submitted its
                            contents to the State Department at Washington, having previously
                            apprised them of the verbal communication made to me on the subject, and
                            have now received under date of March 9 (n. s.), 1894, a dispatch from
                            the Secretary of State taking up the proposals made by the Imperial
                            foreign office as above.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary states that his reply has been unavoidably delayed by the
                            failure, thus far, of the British Government to commence negotiations
                            for the enforcement of the award of the Paris Tribunal of
                            Arbitration.</p>
                        <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0418"/>
                        <p>He also states regarding that award that it constitutes a valid
                            obligation on the contracting parties, and that every effort is being
                            made by the United States to give it speedy effect in all its ports.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary also authorizes me to say that the award contemplates that
                            the United States and Great Britain shall extend joint invitations to
                            other powers to give their adhesion to such measures as may be agreed
                            upon for the enforcement of the reported regulations.</p>
                        <p>He also refers with evident satisfaction to the cordial character of the
                            proposal of Russia as indicating the willingness on the part of the
                            Imperial Government to come into some general, equitable, and durable
                            arrangement as regards the questions concerned.</p>

                        <p>On the 9th instant, by my No. 165, I answered your dispatch No. 178, of
                            January 10, in relation to the suggested Russo-American modus vivendi in
                            regard to the furseal fisheries of the North Pacific, and pointed out
                            the necessity of deferring a joint understanding reciprocally applicable
                            to the waters within the purview of the award of the Paris tribunal of
                            arbitration, until the invitation contemplated in that award could be
                            extended by the United States and Great Britain acting in concert.</p>
                        <p>Since then, as the result of conference I have had with the Russian
                            minister here, the way has been opened for the adoption of a more
                            limited understanding with the Imperial Government.</p>
                        <p>I have given to Prince Cantacuzene a draft of a modus vivendi, a copy of
                            which I inclose, in order that you may submit it to the Russian
                            Government for its information as to what the United States are willing
                            to do in this relation.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that the modus vivendi is not reciprocal in its
                            application to the eastern waters of the North Pacific and Bering Sea.
                            Our information is that Russian subjects have never taken seal on our
                            side of those waters, and there is no reason to apprehend that they will
                            do so now. For that reason the United States exact nothing from Russia
                            in the way of reciprocity, relying on the stipulated right to terminate
                            the agreement at will, in the event of Russia permitting her subjects to
                            poach in the waters embraced in the regulations of the Paris award.</p>
                        <p>My telegram of the 8th instant advised you of the essential features of
                            the proposed modus.</p>

                                Russian possessions in Bering Sea.</hi></p>
                        <p>The fur seals resort at present chiefly to the Commander and Pribilof
                            islands in Bering Sea; these animals are only met with in small numbers
                            on other points of the Northern Hemisphere, as on Tulienew Island, among
                            the Russian possessions, and on the Kurile Islands. On the Southern
                            Hemisphere, where formerly they were somewhat numerous, they hardly
                            exist any longer. In their regular migrations they rarely leave the warm
                            ocean currents, one of which, the Kamtchatka current, takes them to the
                            Commander Islands, and the other, which follows the American coast,
                            carries them to the Pribilof Islands.</p>
                        <p>The seals ordinarily appear on these islands at the end of April or
                            commencement of May. The males, which are the first to arrive, establish
                            themselves on the shore, always in the same places, each one of them
                            taking a certain extent of ground; the females follow them about a month
                            later; they are for the most part with young and come up on shore often
                            some days, sometimes a few hours, before bringing forth. The newly born
                            seals are nourished by the milk of their mothers and this care obliges
                            the latter to return constantly to shore.</p>
                        <p>In the interest of the preservation of these animals, seals should be
                            killed on shore at the hauling grounds chiefly in June and July, since
                            at that time their skins have the desired quality, killing only the
                            “bachelor” males, which should be the sole object of the industry,
                            leaving the males serving for reproduction (sekatchi) with their harems
                            of females. Hunting on the open sea, which is done with nets or
                            firearms, is very injurious to the regular industry, since in that way
                            the animals are killed without distinction, young or old, male or female
                            (the latter generally with young); furthermore, the number of animals
                            killed is not proportioned to their reproduction. For every seal killed
                            many are wounded and carried far away without <pb n="394"
                                xml:id="pg_394" facs="0420"/>profit to the sealer. Finally, the
                            fright caused to the animals by pelagic hunting hinders their regular
                            migration to their rookeries; this is why, in the opinion of
                            specialists, that sort of hunting may lead to the complete destruction
                            of the species. It has been frequently stated how great an influence the
                            abuse of the practice of this industry on the open sea has had in the
                            diminution of the seals. The regular industry has only been able to
                            exist owing to the occasional reduction of such abuse.</p>
                        <p>The sealing industry commenced from the discovery of the Pribilof and
                            Commander islands at the end of the eighteenth century. In the early
                            times its character was that of a veritable devastation, which brought
                            about the consequences indicated above. Although the Russo-American
                            Company, founded in 1799, showed a certain weak desire to put an end to
                            this devastation, still, even during its existence, young seals of four
                            months, male and female, “greys,” were destroyed with such persistence
                            that the persons engaged in the industry could no longer even find a
                            sale for their product; they heated their stoves, baths, furnaces, with
                            seal skins, and sometimes threw them into the sea. This condition of
                            things lasted until 1803, when, by order of the Russian administration
                            on the American shore, the business was suspended for two years on the
                            island of St. George, and for four years on the island of St. Paul.
                            After these short interims the devastation recommenced, and the number
                            of seals again began to diminish. In 1830 attention was again brought to
                            the situation on the island of St. Paul, and the killing was limited to
                            males, young or old, from the age of 2 or 3 years upward. On Bering and
                            Medny islands the industry had entirely ceased on account of the
                            diminution of the species there. Later the company, on administrative
                            order, limited its industry to 4,000 skins a year.</p>
                        <p>When, in 1867, the Territory of Alaska was, with its dependent islands,
                            ceded by Russia to the United States, the Russo-American Company was
                            dissolved and the seal industry on the Commander and Tuleny islands
                            remained in the hands of the Russian Government. Other places of resort
                            of these animals were then discovered on certain points of the eastern
                            coast of Kamchatka and of the Asiatic continent on the shores of the
                            Japan Sea and along the Strait of Tartary.</p>
                        <p>Sealing was then engaged in by the Aleutes, the aborigines of the
                            Commander Islands, who so reduced the number of these animals that a new
                            company, founded in 1871 to farm the industry in question in the Russian
                            possessions, could only take the first year 3,000 skins. More rational
                            measures were taken to insure the reproduction of the seals. In place of
                            killing the gray seals of 4 months old, the sex of which could not be
                            distinguished exteriorly, only those animals were killed which are
                            called “bachelors,” that is to say 3-year-old males, leaving the females
                            of the same age for reproductive purposes. The term of the concession
                            granted to that company expired in 1891, after which the State concluded
                            to contract with a new concessionary company, called the Russian
                            Company, for the exploitation of seals. This exploitation on the
                            Commander and Tuleny islands was confined to it for ten years. Among the
                            conditions imposed on it were the observance of rules concerning the
                            quantity and quality of the animals killed, the time, place, and method
                            of hunting these animals, the skins of which were sent each year to the
                            company by the natives. The Government of, Russia has shown itself to be
                            desirous of putting this industry into the most rational condition
                            possible, in the interest of the conservation of a property which is the
                            means of existence of the sparse population of these islands.</p>
                        <p>The measures taken by the Government, as well as the restrictions imposed
                            on sealing on Russian territory, which were equally binding upon the
                            concessionaires and the natives, were found to be insufficient for the
                            preservation of the species, on account of the damage caused by pelagic
                            sealing, which was pursued regardless of rules. At the time of the
                            Russo-American Company, already foreigners, American or Canadian,
                            engaged in illicit commerce with the natives on the coasts of Bering Sea
                            and the Pacific Ocean, furnishing the inhabitants with guns and strong
                            drink, and unduly exploiting the hunting and fishing industries. After
                            the cession of Alaska to the United States and the suppression of that
                            company, which took certain measures, inefficacious though they were,
                            against the exploitation of these industries by poaching vessels,
                            poaching increased, and especially the sealing in Russian waters. The
                            vessels coming into our waters for that purpose, especially from Canada,
                            knew perfectly well that it was the habit of the seals to assemble at a
                            certain time, corresponding to migrations of the fish in the open sea,
                            at what is called the “sealing grounds;” that is to say, at the places
                            where are to be found the marine plants, and where they found the fish
                            on which they fed. The crews of these vessels killed these animals in
                            great masses, without distinction of sex or age. Each year the
                            importance of this industry, injurious to the preservation of the
                            species, increased. According to an approximate estimate made from 1888
                            to 1891, there were put upon the market a product of pelagic sealing
                            amounting to about 100,000 skins, of which seven-tenths were those of
                            females bearing young.</p>
                        <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0421"/>
                        <p>Especially the activity of these vessels increased after the conclusion,
                            in 1891, of the agreement between the United States and England, totally
                            interdicting sealing in the eastern portion of Bering Sea, that is to
                            say, in the waters to the east of the line of demarcation of 1867. The
                            freebooters then betook themselves to the western part of that sea. It
                            has been shown that in 1890 43 foreign vessels were engaged in the
                            business under these conditions, and killed 53,136 animals. In 1891 the
                            number of these vessels was 84, having killed 50,000 seals, 9,500 of
                            which were taken in Russian waters; in 1892, 62 vessels, two of which
                            were steamers; their spoils were 45,000 seal skins, 15,000 of which were
                            taken in Russian waters. These figures are certainly below the actual
                            facts, and the local authorities were of the opinion that the number of
                            seals killed was very much greater.</p>
                        <p>The chief of administration of the Commander Islands stated that in 1892,
                            notably, 60 poaching vessels came to the islands, killing seals on land
                            and sea. Some of the marauders knocked over the beasts, while others
                            exchanged shots with the coast guards employed in protecting the
                            industry. The audacity of these marauders reached the point that they
                            knocked over the seals on their very hauling grounds. As regards the
                            island of Tuleny in particular, the marauders went there each year after
                            the military guard had been withdrawn, owing to the impossibility of
                            leaving them there on account of the climatic conditions on that island,
                            and killed the seals which remained. Then in 1891 the guard, on
                            returning in the spring, found the bodies of 5,000 seals from which the
                            skins had been removed.</p>
                        <p>This organized marauding was not confined to the acts of captains of
                            vessels; it had become a regular commercial enterprise, in which
                            considerable capital was embarked. According to the report of the
                            Russian consul-general at New York, a certain number of San Francisco
                            capitalists, besides captains of vessels, having brought together for
                            the purpose half a million dollars, participated in the fitting out of
                            vessels engaged in this enterprise, which were sent out from ports of
                            the American Union. The crews of these vessels were composed of men
                            ready for bold undertakings, and to whom the fear of stern measures was
                            but an inducement.</p>
                        <p>The cruising of Russian war ships in the Bering Sea commenced in 1875,
                            when for the first time the clipper <hi rend="italic">Haidamak</hi> was
                            sent to put an end to the illegal commerce in strong drinks in which
                            certain American and other vessels were engaged with the natives. These
                            vessels were in reality engaged in sealing. Soon after, war ships were
                            detached from the Russian naval forces for this duty in the Pacific
                            Ocean. To the same end the ministry of marine established, in 1884, on
                            the island of Tuleny, a guard composed of 19 men and 1 officer from the
                            commencement of May until the end of October. But afterwards, when in
                            1891 a great influx of marauding vessels had commenced, ordinary
                            measures of precaution, such as sending the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aleute</hi> was, were insufficient. A special vessel was deemed
                            necessary to be employed in permanent service, and therefore the <hi
                                rend="italic">Yakout</hi>, bought in England for this service, left
                            in 1892 for Bering Sea. Following the sessions of the commission over
                            which Privy Counsellor Kapoustine presided, certain legislative
                            enactments wereput in operation; a prohibitive zone of 30 miles was
                            established and recognized by England in the arrangement of 1893. But in
                            his report for that year the governor-general of the Amour, while
                            admitting that the establishment of that zone had a certain good effect,
                            stated that the purpose of preservation was not accomplished, since
                            foreign vessels continued to hunt outside of that zone, killing the
                            seals en masse or frightening them from their accustomed route, and
                            preventing them from following the currents which brought them to the
                            Commander Islands and other places where they passed the summer. To this
                            circumstance it was necessary to attribute the diminution of the
                            production of the industry on these islands farmed by the Russian
                            Company.</p>
                        <p>The diminution of this production was so great in 1895 that only 16,652
                            skins resulted, making a considerable difference in the provisions of
                            the contract entered into with the company, in which 50,000 animals was
                            estimated as the number to be taken annually. Such a difference existed
                            notably, in fact, in 1891, when the operations of the company
                                commenced.<note n="a" xml:id="d33fn3">The annual returns are as
                                follows: 1891, 30,689 skins; 1892, 31,315; 1893, 32,830; 1894,
                                27,237.</note> Still smaller returns were to be expected in 1896,
                            and should be from 8,000 to 12,000 skins, since the operations on Medny
                            Island had greatly declined, following the disappearance of many
                            colonies of the animals. According to authentic reports, marauding
                            vessels in 1895 hunted between the coast of Kamchatka and Bering Island,
                            on the shores of which thousands of newly born seals were found, the
                            mothers of which had evidently been killed at a short distance from the
                            shore; this supposition becomes a certainty when the manner of life of
                            these animals is given. For these reasons, and in consideration of the
                            damage caused to the company farming the industry, the Russian
                            Government consented to a reduction of the obligations due its treasury
                            by that company.</p>

                        <p>In the first case, as in those following, the defendant party refers to
                            the arguments submitted above to the honorable arbitrator in the present
                            rejoinder and its annexes and maintains the same conclusions developed
                            in the counter-memorandum.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the fact that this is a question of a whaler, set up by the
                            party claimant, the defendant party declares that the interdiction of
                            hunting under penalty of confiscation of vessel and cargo, contained in
                            the notice published in 1881–82, extended to all the animals of the sea
                            (Exhibit F) and consequently also to whales. As has been said in the
                            counter-memorandum, if Lieutenant von Cube, commanding the Russian
                            schooner <hi rend="italic">Maria</hi>, believed that the seizure was in
                            consonance with the duty with which he was charged of arresting vessels
                            engaged in illicit sealing, it was because he suspected the <hi
                                rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> of being one of those vessels
                            which act as depots for the spoils of such hunting.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party has declared itself ready to reimburse the parties in
                            interest to the amount of $2,500 ($1,000, $200, $210, $50, $1,040), with
                            interest at 6 per cent from September 15 (27), 1892, but it rejects all
                            the other demands.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party maintains on its behalf that there is a repetition
                            for the same object in the American memorandum in relation to the
                            indemnity to the crew for services rendered in bringing the schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">Maria</hi> to Vladivostok. Discarding all idea of
                            outrage, the defendant party recalls attention to the very exceptional
                            situation at that time regarding the supervision of the western portion
                            of Bering Sea, and states that Lieutenant von Cube acted in perfect good
                            faith in bringing to Vladivostok an American bark regarded by him as
                            suspicious, and obliging the crew thereof to take service on a Russian
                            war ship. The defendant party is ready, however, to turn over the sum of
                            $1,000 for such service, as well as the sums of $200 expenses of board,
                            $210 for lodgings, and $50 for the personal expenses of the captain, and
                            further, $1,040 for the general expenses of the owners of the bark.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the bad treatment alleged to have been inflicted on the
                            crew, the defendant party protests, as it has always done, against these
                            allegations, which are bare of any sufficient evidence.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party believes that it has sufficiently developed in the
                            counter-memorandum and in the present rejoinder the reasons why it is
                            unable to admit that the present case, as well as the others, could
                            offer grounds for indirect damages, inasmuch as the arguments set forth
                            above are not specially applicable to sealing, but relate to the hunting
                            of all marine animals. The defendant party further points out that the
                            party claimant has put forward very particularly the obligation of
                            making restitutio in integrum. But it does not seem that this term <pb
                                n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0423"/>of Roman law is applicable to
                            the present case; it relates to the canceling of the legal consequences
                            of a certain act, that is to say, the reestablishment of the original
                            situation of rights by reason of certain circumstances, for instance,
                            for the state of minority of the person who has concluded a
                                contracts.<note n="a" xml:id="subch9fna">Windscheid. Manual of
                                Pandectic Law, section 114 et seq.; Gudsmidt. Courts of the
                                Pandectes, section 109 et seq.</note> The special rule which
                            concerns cases of this nature can not be confounded with the
                            qualifications of settlement of damages. It must be stated again in this
                            connection that even by the term lucrum cessans could not be understood
                            every sort of profit that a person might eventually be able to obtain if
                            an unexpected circumstance had not occurred to prevent, but by it should
                            be understood the profit on which that person could count with
                            certainty. The Roman laws (Fr. 29 ad leg. Aquil. 9, 2) said positively
                            that if a net was damaged one could not estimate the value of the fish
                            which, owing to that circumstance, could not have been taken. The
                            defendant party only feels itself bound to make restitution for the real
                            damage, damnum emergens, as having acted in a case of force ma jure and
                            of legitimate defense owing to exceptional circumstances, and in making
                            use of that which was its right within the limits which the party
                            claimant can not do otherwise than recognize; consequently the defendant
                            party invokes in this place the adage, qui jure suo utitur, neminem
                            loedit.</p>

                        <p>With regard to the second case, the defendant party states, first, that
                            the party claimant insists upon the distance from the coast at which the
                            seizure occurred. But it is a point which the defendant party believes
                            can not be disputed, that if a wrong is committed in waters over which
                            the jurisdiction of a State extends, pursuit can be continued onto the
                            high seas, the common property of all nations. The limit of permissible
                            pursuit ends where the border jurisdiction of another State begins. The
                            application of this principle was particularly necessary when it was
                            question of exercising supervision over a great extent of coast with a
                            very limited number of vessels and in view of the audacity of the
                            poachers. The defendant party dismisses, therefore, discussion as to the
                            exact spot where the seizure occurred, and refers to the documents
                            previously submitted by it.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the point at which the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi> was sighted by the Russian war ship <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aleout</hi>, the defendant party, while maintaining that the
                            American schooner was then at least 5 miles from the coast, believes it
                            is warranted in invoking in this case all of the arguments submitted
                            above in this rejoinder. In maintaining the necessity of admitting an
                            exceptional modification of the generally admitted rule regarding the
                            extent of territorial waters, the defendant party might possibly have
                            encounted a more conservative view on the part of England, which,
                            however, had by the agreement of 1893 admitted that the situation
                            justified such modification, thus consenting by contract; but the
                            defendant party could not have supposed that the party claimant would
                            one day contest the right of seizure exercised under these conditions.
                            Besides, even from a theoretical point of view, the limit of marine
                            jurisdiction is to-day considered by authorities on questions of
                            international law as extending beyond 3 miles.</p>
                        <p>Undoubtedly the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> was not
                            surprised in the act of sealing when she was sighted, but she was
                            violating the terms of the notice of 1881, which had also been published
                            at San Francisco (see above Case 1), giving to the term “Russian waters”
                            a meaning so broad that it could not be mistaken by the American
                            Government, and which the situation warranted.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party may also refer to certain understandings proposed
                            previous to 1892 between the two Governments, but which did not result,
                            it is true, in an agreement with England, which had participated in
                            these negotiations. At the time when the arrangement known as the Blaine
                            Memorandum was being negotiated, the Cabinets of St. Petersburg and
                            Washington, in 1889, incidentally agreed upon the following point: They
                            deemed it proper to make seizures in cases flagrante delicto as well as
                            those where it could be shown that a vessel had engaged in prohibited
                            hunting before being sighted by a <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399"
                                facs="0425"/>cruiser. (Exhibits G and H.) A proclamation by the
                            President of the United States was issued in that sense on March 21,
                                1889,<note n="a" xml:id="subch10fna">It is to this proclamation that
                                reference is made in Exhibit H.</note> in conformity with the law
                            passed by Congress the 2d March, 1889. (Exhibit I.)</p>
                        <p>The defendant party believes that that arrangement between the two
                            Governments may be justly taken into consideration, although it did not
                            result in a definite agreement. As for Exhibit A of the rejoinder of the
                            party claimant, it could not be applicable to the present case. It is
                            question of a certified translation of clause 21 of the Imperial Marine
                            Prize Laws, wherein is set forth the limit of marine jurisdiction,
                            claimed by Russia to be 3 miles. It might be argued in the first place
                            that the term “cannon range” used in this document as alternative to
                            that of “3 miles,” implies moreover a much greater extent in view of
                            modern technical progress. But in the present case there is no question
                            of prize of war, properly speaking, but of the necessary protection of
                            an industry of great importance to Russian interests in the Pacific
                            Ocean, an industry for which was invoked the principles of legitimate
                            defense. They were confronted with marauders, with whom they must deal
                            severely.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, it appears from the contents of the document itself cited by
                            the party claimant that it was not intended to deal definitely with the
                            subject. The regulations of 1869 had to be submitted to another
                            examination, and to legislative steps of a definite nature, to date only
                            from the publication of the Regulations of Marine Prizes of March 21,
                            1895. By virtue of article 16 of this regulation<note n="b"
                                xml:id="subch10fnb">Arrest, inspection, and seizure of enemy or
                                suspected vessels and cargoes is permitted over the whole extent of
                                sea and other waters, except such as are under control of a neutral
                                power, or else have been set aside from war operations by virtue of
                                special diplomatic agreement.</note> the idea of “open sea” was left
                            without express meaning, for the reasons set forth briefly in the
                            counter memorandum of the defendant party.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party points out in the rejoinder of the party claimant
                            that the latter characterizes sealing in open sea as an industry
                            legitimately prosecuted at that time. The inconveniences of that
                            operation at certain distances from the coast were, however, well known
                            by the party claimant. The use of nets for sealing was then considered
                            by the party claimant as extremely injurious to the legitimate sealing
                            industry, yet there was a net aboad the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi>. Annex II to the present rejoinder sufficiently shows the
                            injury done by killing female seals; the defendant party, on this point,
                            can not do better than to refer to the argument advanced by the American
                            delegate before the tribunal of arbitration at Paris in 1893, as also to
                            the interdiction of the United States Government itself, which has been
                            legalized as shown by a legislative act to that effect passed by
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party maintains that the proceedings of the hunt in
                            question being contrary to what was then the United States law, the
                            party claimant is not warranted in submitting them as being
                            justified.</p>
                        <p>So far as the authenticity of the log book is concerned, the defendant
                            party maintains the opinions it expressed in the counter memorandum and
                            declares itself ready to admit all the expert testimony that the
                            arbitrator may deem necessary.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party continues of the opinion that the flight before the
                            Russian man-of-war constitutes in itself an acknowledgment of <pb
                                n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0426"/>guilt on the part of the
                            American vessel. It rejects in the present case all allegations as to
                            ill-treatment inflicted on the members of the crew of the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, as also all damages on
                            account of their arrest.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the similarity which the party claimant undertakes to set
                            up between the present case and those of marine prizes in alleging that
                            an admiralty court was not instituted, the defendant party again
                            declares that it does not come under the head of marine prize cases,
                            properly speaking. The seizures were made in consonance with the Russian
                            law according to the notice published in San Francisco; it is for the
                            Imperial Government to determine whose shall be the authority to decide
                            as to the legitimacy of the seizure.</p>
                        <p>For all of the above-mentioned reasons the defendant party repeats its
                            request that the demands of the party claimant on all the points be
                            rejected.</p>

                            <p>According to your opinion, that our cruisers should proceed on the
                                high seas to inspect and seize vessels in flagrante delictu
                                regarding prohibited sealing, it seems to us improbable that
                                seizures can be made under these conditions, and besides, the
                                proclamation of the President of the United States announcing that
                                all persons and vessels engaged in or having engaged in prohibited
                                hunting shall be liable to arrest and seizure. The term “having
                                engaged in” implies according to us the idea that seizure will
                                result not only in cases of vessels taken in flagrante delictu, but
                                will also extend to vessels convicted of having engaged in sealing,
                                which may be proved by the presence on board of sealing equipments,
                                skins of animals, etc.</p>
                            <p>Seeing the necessity of avoiding all misunderstandings and of
                                insuring the efficacy of protective measures, I advise you to clear
                                up this point without delay.</p>

                            <p>Your interpretation of the proclamation of the President is perfectly
                                correct, and Blaine has just repeated to me that American cruisers
                                have instructions to carry it out to the letter.</p>
                            <p>We certainly may seize vessels convicted of having practiced
                                prohibited sealing without fear that the Americans will not do
                                likewise on their part. The terms “engaged in sealing,” or,
                                according to the English, “engaged in hunting fur seals,” used in
                                paragraph 9 of the memorandum draft, are sufficiently general to
                                include the cases of flagrante delictu, as well as those wherein can
                                be shown by conclusive proofs that a vessel had engaged in
                                prohibited hunt before being sighted by a cruiser. It appeared to
                                us, in discussing terms, inopportune and superfluous to further
                                particularize even in the text of the memorandum, the proclamation
                                of the President being very explicit in this respect and our
                                executive administrative orders issued since 1882 being of the same

                            <p>Now, therefore, I, Benjamin Harrison, President of the United States,
                                pursuant to the above-recited statutes, hereby warn all persons
                                against entering the waters of Bering Sea, within the dominion of
                                the United States, for the purpose of violating the provisions of
                                said section 1956, Revised Statutes, and I hereby proclaim that all
                                persons found to be, or to have been engaged in any violation of the
                                laws of the United States in said waters, will be arrested and
                                punished as above provided, and that all vessels so employed, their
                                tackle, apparel, furniture, and cargoes will be seized and
                                forfeited.</p>
                            <p>In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal

                        <head>The “C. H. White.’</head>
                        <p>With reference to the third case, the defendant party also sets forth
                            that the affair presents itself as a difference arising between the two
                            Governments in opposition to the bilateral understandings entered upon
                            in the course of negotiations since 1887, and which answered the common
                            purpose sought for. In the opinion of the defendant party, the
                            understandings under discussion and the attitude assumed by the party
                            claimant at that time in the whole matter ought to be decisive in the
                            examination of the case at issue. The attitude then assumed by the party
                            claimant gave rise to disputes between it and England, with whom the
                            defendant party was treating on the same question, in the same spirit as
                            the Government of the United States, without, however, emulating the
                            latter in the very extensive claims which it brought. But in the present
                            arbitration England is not the party claimant; it is the Government of
                            the United States that finds itself at present in the position then
                            occupied by the London cabinet, and is thus led by this reversion of
                            rôles, as is stated in the American memorandum and rejoinder, to avail
                            itself now of the arguments then invoked by the British Government. The
                            defendant party deems that the case of the <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                                White</hi> should be considered as taking into account the special
                            tie created between the American and Russian Governments by their common
                            attitude with England, as well as of the point of view sustained by the
                            Washington Cabinet, which found expression with regard to the
                            suppression of maraud in the Presidential proclamation of 1889, above
                            mentioned, and in the legislation of the United States.</p>
                        <p>With regard specially to the American vessels, the Russian Government
                            could not suppose that the well-founded measures taken by it would some
                            day be contested by the party claimant, and that it might find itself
                            confronted by a controversy arising from actions condemned at that time
                            by the Government of the United States. There could not be <hi
                                rend="italic">injuria</hi> in the case of the party claimant, when
                            it is a question of acts not overreaching the limits assigned by it to
                            the principles it had proclaimed as being the <hi rend="italic"
                            >jus</hi>, and which it had introduced in its own legislation.</p>
                        <p>Captain de Livron, commander of the Russian cruiser <hi rend="italic"
                                >Zabiaka</hi>, stated that the American schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >C. H. White</hi> had aboard seal skins and seals newly killed,
                            guns, powder, and other accessories of the hunting of these animals. He
                            furthermore stated that at a certain time the <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                                White</hi> had passed at 3 miles off the southern extremity of Medny
                            Island. As is mentioned in Exhibit G, if it was question of efficacious
                            suppression of maraud, it could not be hoped, considering the small
                            number of war ships, to always overtake the marauders at the precise
                            moment they were engaged in sealing. The suppression would thus <pb
                                n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0429"/>have to be illusory. Captain de
                            Livron acted in conformity to Russian governmental instructions,
                            published in 1881–82, as well as in the spirit of the agreements between
                            the Russian and American Governments, in confiscating the schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, which decision was submitted to the
                            highest maritime authority, who found it perfectly regular.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party rejects, for the same reasons as in the case of the
                                <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, the argument drawn from
                            the fact that an admiralty court had not been instituted, and it again
                            protests against the allegations of ill treatment claimed to have been
                            inflicted upon the crew of the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White.</hi></p>
                        <p>Concerning the fact that the log book of the <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                                White</hi> was not presented conjointly with the counter memorandum
                            of the Imperial Government and the statement of circumstances and
                            motives of the arrest is supported by the report of the Russian
                            commander who made the seizure, the defendant party deems it well to
                            observe the following: The said report of Captain de Livron states that
                            the log book of the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> showing that the
                            vessel had remained in the proximity of the Medny Island, and that the
                            course followed by her on her return led her to pass 3 miles off that
                            island, has the appearance of a Russian official document whose
                            authenticity is certified to by the Imperial Government, which, through
                            the medium of its highest maritime authorities, attested the correctness
                            of the allegation of Captain de Livron set forth in the above-mentioned
                            report.</p>
                        <p>For the above reasons, the defendant party again requests that the
                            demands of the party claimant be rejected in all its points.</p>

                        <head>“Kate and Anna.”</head>
                        <p>The defendant party in its counter memorandum set forth the reasons why
                            it feels obliged to pay for the 124 seal skins confiscated from, the <hi
                                rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> a sum of $1,240, with interest at 6
                            per cent.</p>
                        <p>The defendant party discards the claim relating to indirect damages for
                            the reasons specified in the present rejoinder. It considers that
                            indemnity for indirect damages is so much less applicable to the present
                            case, because the American vessel above mentioned was only detained in
                            her course without having been confiscated, and that consequently it was
                            entirely free to continue sealing, in so far as was legitimate. It was
                            only notified by the commander of the Russian cruiser to stop sealing in
                            Russian waters. Proof of this is given in the document submitted to the
                            arbitration which, in the present case, is in itself sufficient evidence
                            of the warning given by the Russian commander.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the said commander could not assume the authority to give
                            prohibitory orders overreaching the instructions furnished to him, and
                            the methods at his command. At any rate he could not compel the American
                            captain to return to the United States. He could not, above all, suppose
                            that Captain Lutjens would comply with such order, had it really been
                            given, for it was very evident there was no reason for such order.</p>
                        <p>From the above arguments the defendant party sustains the conclusions
                            which it has submitted, concerning this affair, in the counter
                            memorandum.</p>

                        <p>The arbitrator made the following address:</p>
                        <p>“Before proceeding to our work, permit me to express my sincere gratitude
                            to the administrative counsel of the Permanent Court of Arbitration for
                            the hospitality he has kindly extended to us in the palace, as well as
                            to the honorable secretary-general and the first secretary of the court
                            for the gracious manner in which they have executed the resolution of
                            the counsel.</p>
                        <p>“I am happy that, thanks to that resolution, we are enabled to inaugurate
                            the home of the court by the proceedings in a litigation between two
                            great powers, one of which has for sovereign the august initiator of the
                            peace conference, while the other was represented by eminent delegates,
                            who took a conspicuous part in the preliminary work of the convention
                            for the pacific settlement of the international differences.</p>
                        <p>“I hope that the institution of the court will contribute largely to the
                            maintenance of peace.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Asser proposes to designate as secretary Mr. W. Roëll, first
                            secretary of the international bureau of the Permanent Court of
                            Arbitration.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Asser says that the French language is recognized as the official
                            language of the arbitration. English will be optional for the
                            experts.</p>
                        <p>The arbitrator states that he has arrived at no decision. The questions
                            must not be regarded as indicating any opinion of the arbitrator. They
                            simply serve for the more complete clearing up of some points by the
                            representatives of the parties and their experts. It is necessary that
                            technical data should not be lacking, after which the difference will
                            have to be examined from a legal point of view.</p>
                        <p>The arbitrator wishes, before proceeding to the examination of the four
                            cases under discussion, to touch upon the three points of law following: <list>

                        <p>The floor is given to the delegate of Russia to furnish explanations on
                            the subject of Questions I and II, which are treated together.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> expresses himself in the following
                            terms:</p>
                        <p>“In addressing you within these walls I can, as a Russian, but say how
                            happy I am in the hospitality which the administrative counsel of <pb
                                n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0434"/>the International Court of
                            Arbitration has extended to us in our labors. The Imperial Government in
                            its reply to the summons which was addressed to it by Mr. Asser has
                            already given expression to its gratitude, for the decision arrived at
                            by the administrative counsel in placing its home and its organization
                            at the disposal of the arbitrator and of the litigants. Thus, for the
                            first time, explanations will be made here by the delegates and experts
                            of the two Governments which have had recourse to this most salutary
                            mode of adjusting differences between states, that of arbitration, the
                            rulings of which constituted one of the most important labors of the
                            peace conference. We find ourselves under the auspices of the Government
                            of the Netherlands which made the great work particularly its own by its
                            notable participation in the labors which so happily terminated the
                            united efforts of all the countries of the civilized world. The
                            arbitrator who is at present called upon to decide the questions pending
                            between the United States and Russia is one of the shining lights of
                            judicial science in the Netherlands. It is therefore an homage which I
                            earnestly address to Holland in the persons of the eminent men who are
                            here present, and chiefly to his excellency the minister of foreign
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>The work of the peace conference is especially dear to Russia’s heart.
                            The Russian Government is one of those which believes firmly in the
                            efficacy of arbitration for the solution of international differences.
                            It has given striking proof of this by submitting to this jurisdiction
                            its difference with a friendly power, the United States, in the affair
                            of the seizure and detention of American vessels in Bering Sea. It is
                            well known in Russia that arbitration is the highest source of
                            international justice. It is that justice which may be expected to
                            result from the exchange of explanations. The Russian Government is
                            ready for its part to contribute all the light desired to illuminate the
                            points not yet sufficiently elucidated. For the entire collection of
                            questions treated in the written communications exchanged between the
                            parties, there have been brought here on the part of Russia new
                            enlightenment. It will remain for the arbitrator to decide the moment
                            when he shall judge that the matter is clear, and that an end should be
                            put to the perhaps necessary oral amplification of a case in which
                            moreover during many years a solidarity of interests and views have been
                            maintained between the Russian and American Governments.”</p>
                        <p>The delegate of the United States reserves the privilege of replying on
                            another day.</p>

                            territory of Alaska.</p>
                        <p>Beginning with the examination of point II<hi rend="superscript"><hi
                                    rend="italic">a</hi></hi> of the list of questions of law asked

                            Russia was not in a position to itself join in the agreement concluded
                            in 1891 between the United States and England with regard to the
                            interdiction of sealing in Bering Sea during one year. To explain the
                            motives for Russia’s refusal the delegate of the Russian Government
                            thinks it proper to briefly review the diplomatic negotiations which had
                            been carried on between Russia, the United States, and England, since
                            1887, on the subject of the protection of seals; to that effect it will
                            be necessary to produce certain documents:</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> maintained that it is not
                            permissible to produce new documents, the evidence in the case having

                            of the United States Government, and the surrejoinder of the Russian

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> submits that the rules of the

                            produced. The arbitrator having asked for supplementary information to
                            be given verbally, the verbal explanations may be accompanied by
                            documentary evidence as well as if the information were furnished in
                            writing.</p>

                            the negotiations relating to the protection of seals since 1887. These
                            negotiations had had for starting point a note from the chargé
                            d’affaires of the United States at St. Petersburg to the Secretary of
                            State De Giers August 22, 1887, and by which the Russian Government was
                            invited to enter into an agreement for the regulation of sealing in
                            Bering Sea and to put an end to the practices of extermination which
                            threatened to drain at its very source an important branch of industry.
                            On November 27, 1887, the Russian Government expressed its adherence to
                            that proposition for agreement, but as it was necessary to assure itself
                            of England’s concurrence in the projected work the United States
                            legation at St. Petersburg, in a note of January 21, 1888, informed the
                            Russian Government that the same steps had been taken with the British
                            Government by expressing the hope that these steps would be supported by
                            the Imperial cabinet, “whose interests in this matter are entirely
                            analogous with those of the Cabinet of Washington.” That solidarity of
                            Russo-American interests which have not ceased to be proclaimed by both
                            sides in the course of the negotiations was affirmed from the very
                            beginning by sending to the Russian ambassador at London the
                            instructions in the sense asked for by the United States.</p>
                        <p>Differing with regard to the nature of the measures successively
                            suggested for arriving at the proposed end, the agreement between the
                            two Governments remains firm on certain points. One of the most
                            important of these is that which was formulated by Mr. Bayard to the
                            chargé d’affaires of Russia at Washington and which the latter set forth
                            in his dispatch of July 19 (31), 1888.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bayard expressed himself as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>We occupy the same premises (we are in the same boat to certain
                                    extent), having to combat the same evil in the Territory of
                                    Alaska, and we encounter the same difficulties. However, the
                                    right of every sovereign power to provide for the security and
                                    inviolability of its territory by all means of prevention and of
                                    suppression in its power is unlimited and incontestable.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The negotiations with England did not end, however, in that first phase
                            of the question, and the two Governments—Russian and American—always
                            considering themselves as closely united with regard to the end to be
                            attained, took on their side measures which they judged incumbent upon
                            them at the moment. It is thus that the proclamation of the President of
                            the United States of March 21, 1889, was published, <pb n="410"
                                xml:id="pg_410" facs="0436"/>which is reproduced in the surrejoinder
                            of the defendant party. The Russian Government was, for its part,
                            engaged in the reorganization of the sealing industry and the
                            preservative measures to be taken. The two Governments did not, however,
                            neglect to study how to deal with England, and it is thus the document
                            known as the Blaine memorial was drawn up in 1889, which was to
                            constitute a formal demand to be made by the two combined cabinets. That
                            document, which the two joint cabinets did not finally send to the
                            British Government, was published in the collection of diplomatic
                            documents at the time.</p>
                        <p>The British Government then showed itself disposed to resume the
                            negotiations at Washington, but without attaining appreciable results in
                            the practical form of an understanding between the three cabinets. The
                            Cabinet of Washington, which independently of the general questions
                            involved in the matter, had yet to treat with England on the solution of
                            the affairs of the seizures of English vessels by American vessels in
                            Bering Sea, concluded with the British Government the agreement of June
                            15, 1891, with regard to all of these litigations, which was called
                            “Agreement for a modus vivendi between the United States and Great
                            Britain relating to the fur-seal fisheries in Bering Sea.”</p>
                        <p>To reply to the question asked by the arbitrator on the subject of the
                            motives and the nonadherence of Russia to the Anglo-American agreement
                            of 1891, Mr. Komarow reads the following documents: <list>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that he would take cognizance
                            of these notes, reserving the right to object to their being submitted
                            to the arbitrator for his consideration.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> then said from all of these
                            documents it is evident that Russia, invited by England to participate
                            in the Anglo-American agreement of 1891, deemed it necessary that the
                            interdiction of sealing in the western part of Bering Sea be applicable
                            to subjects of the three States as in the eastern part.</p>
                        <p>The impossibility, alleged in the note of Sir Robert Morier of July 10
                            (22), 1891, for the Government of the United States to enact soon enough
                            a prohibition to its citizens to seal in the western part of the Bering
                            Sea rendered illusory the measures which the cabinets of London and St.
                            Petersburg proposed to take with regard to their subjects. Sir Robert
                            Morier concluded by declaring that under these conditions the agreement
                            would not be desirable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Komarow stated that in spite of Russia’s nonadherence to the
                            Anglo-American agreement of 1891, the general agreement on the subject
                            of the protection of seals between the cabinets of St. Petersburg and
                            Washington remains quite within the limits maintained in the course of
                            the negotiations, notably with regard to the sending of cruisers for the
                            suppression of poaching and the right of the interested <pb n="411"
                                xml:id="pg_411" facs="0437"/>States to take such measures of
                            preservation as they deemed necessary over an expanse so vast and so
                            difficult to efficaciously protect. Russia, moreover, has always
                            maintained for its part that certain of these industries were entitled
                            to special privileges. That doctrine is notably affirmed in the note of
                            Mr. De Giers of May 28, 1892. (See memorandum of the party claimant.</p>
                        <p>It is known that in certain countries the coast industries are the object
                            of special protection as regards the extent of jurisdiction. A list of
                            these industries is to be found in volume 10 of the Proceedings of the
                            Tribunal of Arbitration of Paris in 1893.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> says that opinions set forth in the
                            arbitration of Paris can not serve as evidence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> (continuing) says that as it was
                            stated in the surrejoinder of the defendant party that the Russian
                            Government considered itself justified in enacting, in 1893, after the
                            decision rendered by the Kapoustine commission, the measures which it
                            deemed necessary for the protection of seals, it enacted these measures
                            unilaterally, and contented itself with imparting them to the British
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The Anglo-Russian agreement of 1893, subsequent to the measure in
                            question, did not create Russia’s right to that special jurisdiction; it
                            only established the fact of England’s recognition of that preexistent
                            right. It was the same with the agreement of 1894 with the United States
                            of America.</p>
                        <p>This point of view of the Russian Government was sustained, moreover, by
                            the United States before the tribunal of Paris. (Acts of the Tribunal of
                            Paris, Vol. XV, pp. 112 and following.) The American delegate, Mr.
                            Phelps, stated that Russia had simply notified England of the decisions
                            of the Kapoustine commission fixing the right of jurisdiction of
                            Russia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>, delegate of the United States, had
                            the floor to reply to the question as to the line of demarcation. The
                            American Government, he said, accepted the property which Russia sold to
                            the United States, with the line of demarcation established by the
                            treaty of 1867 and interpreted the line of demarcation of the treaty of
                            1837 as attributing to it a property right over the eastern part of
                            Bering Sea, consequently a special jurisdiction. The award of the
                            tribunal of Paris of 1893 did not recognize this right of the United
                            States. According to the award of 1893 it does not own the waters of
                            that part of Bering Sea situated to the east of the line cited, which
                            the American Government believed it had acquired.</p>
                        <p>It must again be stated that the United States and Russia are in
                            arbitration on the same question. The United States have paid; they now
                            exact that Russia pay for the vessels seized.</p>
                        <p>The arbitrator, Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">T. M. C. Asser</hi>, then
                            invited Mr. Komarow to explain himself as to the Question II (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>), with regard to the significance given by the
                            Imperial Government to the expression “Western part of Bering Sea” for
                            which that Government took special measures by sending vessels to those
                            parts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> stated that after the conclusion of
                            the treaty of 1867 between Russia and the United States of America the
                            Russian Government did not claim the right of jurisdiction over the
                            whole of the western part of Bering Sea. By the western part of Bering
                            Sea must be understood the extent of that sea which is situated to the
                            west of the <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0438"/>line of demarcation
                            of 1867. The line of demarcation according to the interpretation of the
                            Russian Government did not imply a property right over all of the
                            respective maritime extents, but it meant that all the land—that is to
                            say, the islands and dependencies with the adjacent waters, situated in
                            one or the other part of Bering Sea—belonged, respectively, to Russia
                            and America. At that epoch certain islets may have been ignored or,
                            perhaps, no precise names had been attributed to them. For this reason,
                            in order to simplify matters, in 1867 a general designation had been
                            employed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> accepted this explanation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> stated that he did not intend to
                            enter into the discussions formerly raised before tribunals of
                            arbitration on the subject of the ukases of Emperor Paul in 1799, and of
                            Emperor Alexander I of 1821, as also of the treaties of 1824 and 1825,
                            concluded by Russia with England and the United States. Assuredly,
                            therefore, until 1867—that is to say, so long as Russia possessed all of
                            the extent of coast bordered by Bering Sea and adjacent waters it
                            exercised its right of protection over the maritime industries dependent
                            upon that region. But with regard to sovereignty, Russia has riot
                            claimed it over the western part of Bering Sea as the United States have
                            claimed it over the eastern part.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> stated that the question of
                            jurisdiction in Bering Sea has been settled by the award of the tribunal
                            of Paris, and thus the American point of view with regard to the seizure
                            of vessels is taken in the light of that decision.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> set forth that Russia was not
                            participant in the arbitration of 1893, and that consequently it is not
                            affected by that decision, insomuch as it may affect the relations
                            between the United States and England. As for the seizures of American
                            vessels by Russian cruisers, Mr. Komarow believes they should be
                            considered from the standpoint of the situation at the time—that is to
                            say, of the actual situation and of the situation created by the
                            agreements between the Russian and American Governments and by the
                            doctrine superior even to those agreements, sustained by the United
                            States against England. When one sets up a claim against a party, that
                            claim should be considered binding on him who invokes it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Komarow futhermore stated that before the tribunal of arbitration of
                            Paris, the American delegate, Mr. Phelps, official agent of his
                            Government interrogated at different times on the subject of how the
                            Cabinet of Washington regarded the seizures of English and American
                            vessels already accomplished (1893) by Russian vessels, replied to the
                            arbitrator that these seizures had been perfectly regular. (Proceedings
                            of the Tribunal of Arbitration of Paris, Vol. XII, 42, 415.)</p>
                        <p>Passing to the question 3 of the programme, the arbitrator asks Mr.
                            Peirce to express himself on the subject of the seizures made by the
                            United States Government before 1893.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> answered that the Government of the
                            United States then believed itself to be justified in making the
                            seizures, but that point of view has changed since then, because then
                            they were ignorant as to the extent of the property they had acquired by
                            virtue of the treaty of 1867.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Asser</hi> asked Mr. Peirce if the United States
                            are now convinced that they were wrong in making the seizures mentioned
                            in the counter <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0439"/>memorandum and
                            what is the extent of jurisdiction which the United States claim to-day
                            in Bering Sea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> answers affirmatively: At that time
                            we did not know the limits of the property. The jurisdiction which the
                            American Government now claims is an extent of 3 miles.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> stated that in any event the United
                            States in fact have jurisdiction over 60 miles, which was sanctioned by
                            the Anglo-American agreement and granted by the award of the Tribunal of
                            Paris.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> protested against the application of
                            a later special convention between Great Britain and the United States.
                            That convention has no bearing upon the present arbitration. The 60
                            miles relate only to the “modus vivendi” between the United States of
                            America and England. The Arbitrator made a remark relating to the number
                            of the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>. According to
                            the memorandum they numbered 30, besides the captain, and according to
                            the ship’s roll, which is annexed to the memorandum, they numbered
                            42.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Clifford</hi>, expert, says it is always
                            necessary to take more sailors, on account of accidents and deserters.
                            Indemnity was asked for 31 men, yet 3 men must be deducted (the captain
                            and 2 men having been taken aboard the Russian vessel); for 8 officers
                            at $10 during six days ($480), and for 20 men at $5 during six days
                            ($600); for the 28 men ($1,080).</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> proposed to first question the
                            Russian experts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> gives the following information on
                            the subject of whaling. (See Annex A.)</p>
                        <p>The session then adjourned to to-morrow, Saturday morning, at 10
                            o’clock.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Session of Saturday morning, June 28,
                                1902.</hi></p>
                        <p>The session opened at 10 o’clock in the morning.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> said that examination of the
                            technical points will be resumed. In the first place he would question
                            the American experts, then the Russian experts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that it was decided yesterday,
                            in the preliminary morning session, that the Russian experts should be
                            examined first, as Mr. Komarow has already given information on the
                            subject of whaling.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> had no objection to the Russian
                            experts being examined first, provided it is so agreed by both
                            parties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> agreed that the examination be
                            reversed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> handed to the arbitrator the notes
                            (see session of Friday, June 27, p. 6) which Mr. Komarow gave him
                            yesterday, also a printed document with regard to the vessels which were
                            seized under the same conditions. (The Bering Sea question, embracing
                            the fur-sealing, industry of the North Pacific Ocean, 1898. 8°. Ottawa.

                        <p>He added that in his opinion the introduction of new testimony was not
                            regular, and he wished to reserve the right to object to the
                            introduction of new arguments.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> said that he desired some
                            information on the whaling season in Okhotsk Sea and on the average
                            number of whales that can be killed there between the 1st and 10th of
                            October, as well as before the 1st of October, as the captain of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> claims an indemnity for the time
                            of his detention at Vladivostock <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0440"
                            />(from September 10, 1892, to Octobei 1, 1892). We must know the number
                            of whales which the captain could have taken during the remainder of the
                            season.</p>
                        <p>He believed he should again state that he asks this information without
                            in any way having decided any question. In case the question of right be
                            affirmatively decided, the arbitrator must be enlightened by the experts
                            in order to fix the amount of indemnity claimed by the party
                            claimant.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> observed that not only must the
                            whaling season but also the time necessary to traverse the entire
                            distance between Vladivostok and the whaling grounds of the Okhotsk Sea
                            be ascertained.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Asser</hi> asked the expert, Professor Kroupsky,
                            whether the method of average can be accepted, and if the method of the
                            party claimant, which takes the average number of whales taken by the
                            captain in his former expeditions in the same waters and deducts the two
                            whales which he had taken during the voyage in question, is just.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi>, Russian expert, gave a copy of a
                            publication emanating from the United States Fish and Fisheries
                            Commission.</p>
                        <p>In Bering Sea, he said, the most favorable season for whaling (during a
                            great part of the year the sea is covered with ice) is during the months
                            of August and September. Among the documents presented to the arbitrator
                            will be found detailed information. Data may also be found in other
                            publications entitled United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries,
                            Part XVI; Report of the Commission for 1888 to June 1889, Washington,
                            1892. Page 81 reads: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The season in the Okhotsk usually begins about the last of May to
                                    the 1st of July and continues to the latter part of October. The
                                    whaling season on the Japan grounds is commonly from May to
                                    November.</p>

                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked what is the distance from
                            Vladivostok to the fisheries in the Okhotsk Sea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Clifford</hi> said that it is necessary to take
                            into consideration the current, the north winds, and the fog. A great
                            speed can not be attained under these unfavorable conditions. It takes
                            about 10 days to traverse the distance from Vladivostok to said
                            fisheries. The distance is 650 miles, but on account of the winds it is
                            necessary to traverse a distance of about 1,000 miles. It must be
                            remarked that there is a typographical error on page 41 of memorandum.
                            It should read December 18, not September 28.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked Professor Kroupsky to
                            kindly indicate upon a marine chart the part of the sea where the
                            fisheries are located.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> produced a marine chart of that
                            region and showed that the distance between Bering Island and the coast
                            of Vladivostok is about 30 degrees of longitude (165°–135°). In a direct
                            line the distance is, approximately, 1,800 kilometers.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> stated that the two parties are
                            agreed upon this calculation. He asked how many whales could have been
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> wished to state, before Mr.
                            Kroupsky answers, that the defendant party, which he represents here,
                            sets forth in his counter memorandum and in his surrejoinder the reasons
                            why it does not admit the indirect damages. As the question relates to
                            the indirect damages, he wishes to state that he maintains the same view
                            as the Imperial Government.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> said that he has already stated
                            that these questions decide nothing.</p>
                        <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0441"/>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi>. As to the estimate of the number
                            of whales which could have been taken, it is difficult to make an
                            estimate; it is a calculation of probability. In making this reservation
                            he says that in eighteen days, at the rate of three days to each whale,
                            6 might be caught.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked him again, “What average
                            do you admit?”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> saw no more reason for admitting
                            6, 7, 8, than more. An average of 6½ might be taken for eighteen
                            days.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>, continuing to question the
                            professor, told him that the captain had already taken two whales, and
                            that, according to the exhibit, the product from one whale, based upon
                            the two whales already taken, is estimated at from 1, 100 to 1,300
                            pounds of bone per whale and of 100 barrels of oil per whale. He asked
                            the expert whether that estimate is correct, and whether the value of
                            the bone is from $1 to $5 per pound, and whether a whale can be
                            estimated at $1,250 for the year 1892.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> said it is only a question of the
                            bones of the head. He estimates that the average of bone obtained from
                            one whale is 1,200 pounds and of oil 100 barrels. The price of the bones
                            was from $1 to $5 per pound in 1898. The price of the oil may be
                            estimated at $13. The prices do not differ from year to year.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Abbitrator</hi> asked if that is the price in
                            the San Francisco market.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Clifford</hi> said that for the oil and bone it
                            is the price of the San Francisco market.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asks if an import duty must be
                            paid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grunwaldt</hi> said “No.”</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> stated that consequently the
                            price of $1 to $5 represents the value of the whalebone on the
                            market.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grunwaldt</hi> said that throughout Russia the
                            average value of a whale is 2,500 roubles.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> asked if the Russian experts have
                            ever seen the whales that are caught at sea or those that are found in
                            the bays.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> said that he speaks of the big
                            whales (bowheads) which are caught at sea. There are two kinds—the
                            “bowheads” and the “right” whales.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> further stated that the Russian
                            experts depend upon the figures contained in an American report, which
                            will be sent to the Arbitrator.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked how the business is
                            carried on.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> says that the products of the
                            whale are prepared upon the vessels or on the coast by the captains of
                            whalers.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> said that consequently the
                            captain sells only the product, and not the whale. He asks what is the
                            price of the bone and oil.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> presented a report from the
                            governor-general of the province of the Amoor. He said that the
                            merchants—that is to say, the retail dealers—make a profit of 100 per
                            cent; that makes a value of 25,000 roubles for one whale. They buy the
                            product at their own risk.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that the price for which the
                            product of one whale is sold to the retail trade has nothing to do with
                            the market price for oil and bone.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> stated also that it is only for
                            the retail trade that the whale is valued at $25,000; but for whalers
                            the price of bone is from $4 to $5 per pound. There are two values, the
                            value of the bone <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0442"/>and oil in
                            the market and the value of the different products in the retail
                            trade.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said he would like to know if Mr.
                            Kroupsky has any experience in the trade in question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> said that he is versed in this
                            business, as he lives where it is carried on.</p>
                        <p>The same question is asked of Mr. Grunwaldt who says that he understands
                            this business.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked Mr. Clifford to make his
                            deposition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Clifford</hi> said that as advocate he is
                            interested with all matters appertaining to commerce. Seventy-five or
                            eighty years ago the New Bedford captains made voyages of from four to
                            five years’ duration and sold their cargoes at San Francisco. Since the
                            existence of the railroad the vessels are in the ports of the west coast
                            (San Francisco), and it is there the captains go aboard their vessels.
                            They go to the whaling grounds, catch the whales, prepare and put the
                            oil into barrels and bone in the holds of their ships. They do not sell
                            the whales, but the bone and oil. They unload the cargo at San
                            Francisco. The captain and crew are paid according to the San Francisco
                            prices, in shares. If the <hi rend="italic">Cafe Horn Pigeon</hi> had
                            taken seven whales, the bone and oil of those whales would have been
                            sold at San Francisco and the captain and crew would have been paid
                            their share of the profit of that voyage. The price of the bone was $6;
                            now it is from $4 to $5. In 1890 Captain Baker had received $5.75.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> put several questions to Captain
                            Baker, experiences in whaling.</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi> said the oil and bone are sold at
                            San Francisco, and sometimes at New Bedford. The price of the bone in
                            1890 was $5.75, and of the oil $13 per barrel. Regarding the catch, he
                            said 6 is a catch, 10 a good catch, 4 a bad catch. During late years he
                            was sent to a new ground by speculators. The catch never exceeded 6
                            whales in twenty days. He has never sold a whale, always the products;
                            he would not know how to value a whale, nor even one of the whales one
                            sees from time to time in exhibitions.</p>
                        <p>The session here adjourned from noon to 3 o’clock.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Session of Saturday afternoon</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The session was opened at 3 o’clock.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Asser</hi> asked Mr. John W. Garret, secretary
                            of the legation of the United States of America, and Mr. Stanislaus
                            Gutowski, attaché of the Imperial embassy at Berlin, acting secretary of
                            the Russian legation at The Hague, to have the kindness to perform with
                            Mr. W. Roel the functions of secretary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Asser</hi> then asked Captain Baker what was his
                            share of the catch. The captain says that he had received a twelfth or a
                            tenth of the catch, which brought him from $3,800 $4,000.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> asks if Captain Baker is in the
                            business himself.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi> answers, Not as a tradesman. He was
                            not in the business but he says he knows the price of the bone and oil
                            of the whale.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> desired to ask several
                            questions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> asked Captain Baker: You have been
                            engaged in whaling for forty-two years, during which you have become
                            thoroughly acquainted with Russian waters?</p>
                        <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0443"/>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes; both Okhotsk and
                            Bering.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Do you know anything about whaling
                            practices except what you have done yourself?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes; Eskimo and Siberian natives
                            whale along shore when ice breaks up early in season. They take
                            grampuses or calves of the right whale or bowhead or finback.</p>
                        <p>(Grampus is a fish with bottle nose, between a whale and a porpoise; it
                            has no whalebone; finback has no bone. Calves of right whales or bowhead
                            have no bone.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Do right whales ever go into the
                            bays?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. No.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. What is the value of whales when
                            taken near shore?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Forty to fifty barrels of oil,
                            perhaps. No large whales are taken from shore. Couldn’t well be
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. In cruising these waters did you
                            ever see a Russian whaling ship?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. No.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. A Russion whaling captain?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. No.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Did you ever have in your crew a
                            Russian subject or other national?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Never a Russian, but many
                            others.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Did you ever hear tell from others
                            of captains of Russian whaling ships?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. No.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Ever hear tell of a Russian being
                            in a crew?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. No.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Do you consider that, except
                            fishing from shore, there is much Russian experience in whaling?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. No, sir.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> handed to the arbitrator a printed
                            document which relates to the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>,
                            from which the Russian delegate yesterday read some passages. He took
                            cognizance of the contents; he is satisfied to leave it in the hands of
                            the honorable arbitrator, but he believes he ought to state that it is
                            an unsigned document, which deprives it of all value from a juridical
                            point of view.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> did not understand the meaning of
                            these words. He said that the publication above mentioned contains only
                            that which he had the honor to say yesterday. The printed matter is
                            returned to Mr. Asser. He added that in the neighborhood of the Medny
                            Islands there are scarcely any whales; it is this that caused the
                            supposition that the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> was engaged
                            in sealing. Moreover, its arrest was acknowledged to be illegal by the
                            Imperial Government. The captain of the man-of-war was punished.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> again questioned Captain Baker with
                            regard to the above-mentioned publication about the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Cape Horn Pigeon.</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Did you know bark <hi rend="italic"
                                >Corral?</hi></p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. In 1898 she was in Okhotsk,
                            fishing?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. No; she went out of service
                            three or four years before that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Did you know the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Stamboul</hi> in 1898?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. She went out of service three or
                            four years before that.</p>
                        <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0444"/>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. You know <hi rend="italic">Cape
                                Horn Pigeon?</hi> You sailed in her?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. She went down at sea, didn’t she?
                            When was it?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. I think about 1896 or 1897.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. But this document shows all of
                            these vessels were whaling in year 1898.</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. That is a mistake.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. The <hi rend="italic"
                                >Josephine</hi>—did you know her?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. She was fishing in 1898—sperm
                            whaling outside Japan Sea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. But this document says she was
                            whaling in the Okhotsk Sea in 1898.</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. They have made a mistake in that
                            year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Were the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Corral</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, and the
                                <hi rend="italic">Josephine</hi> fishing in Okhotsk Sea in 1888?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Was <hi rend="italic">Corral</hi>
                            fishing in Okhotsk Sea in 1899?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. No; she was not in 1899; she was
                            fishing along Alaska coast.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Did you know the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Tropic Bord?</hi></p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Was she fishing in Japan Sea in
                            1881?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. What sort of ship was she?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Third class, small, about 100
                            tons; crew of about 23 or 24 men; not capable of getting much of a
                            catch; couldn’t hold it if she got it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Did you know the <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Was she fishing in Okhotsk Sea in
                            1883–84?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. She didn’t get much bone or
                            oil?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. No; she didn’t finish the season
                            there; she was there in May to July. If she had stayed till September
                            she would have done better. She was too early for whaling in Okhotsk
                            Sea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                                Pigeon;</hi> did you know her?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Was she third class?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. No; first class.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. What do you mean by a first-class
                            ship?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Anywhere from 210 to 350 or 360
                            tons.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Was she well equipped?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. She was; she had 4 boats;
                            first-class equipment and first-class captain.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Was she a successful whaler?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes; always made money for her
                            owners.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Could she command a good
                            captain?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. You know her well?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Was she staunch?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes; I would take her
                            anywhere.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. She was the sort of boat that would
                            get a good captain?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0445"/>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. You were her captain at one
                            time?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes; I was captain in
                            1871–1879.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Who owned her at that time?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. William Potter.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. Not Wing &amp; Co.?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. No; they owned her later.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. You knew her when Scullen was
                            sailing her?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Is there much difference between
                            whaling captains?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. As much as there is in other
                            men: some work hard and some don’t.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Knowledge plays a considerable part
                            in success of a whaling captain, does it not?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. The experienced and intelligent
                            whaleman has the better chance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Was Scullen a good captain?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. He had a high reputation in San
                            Francisco and in New Bedford.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Were the whales you caught in
                            Okhotsk Sea small?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. No. They were large where I
                            fished.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Was that the same place where
                            Scullen would be likely to fish?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. You wouldn’t bother with small
                            whales?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. No; because they haven’t much
                            bone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. When you were whaling, what was the
                            money value of bone?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. $3.50 to $5.50 per pound. On one
                            voyage I got $5.75.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce.</hi> You got that price yourself from
                            your owners?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. As your share?</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Baker</hi>. Yes. For the last three or four
                            years previous to that I got about $3.30.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> submitted copy of “Whaleman’s
                            Shipping List,” dated February 23, 1897, showing prices from 1851 to
                            1897; year 1892 average price $5.50 per pound for bone.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asks if Mr. Komarow has nothing
                            to add on the question of whales.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> requested that Mr. Grunwaldt be
                            heard.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grunwaldt</hi> said that Mr. Liebes, of San
                            Francisco, founder of the Alaska Company, pays to the captains of
                            whalers a certain sum of money from the contractors before their
                            departure. Thus they go whaling at their risk and cost. It might be that
                            such an arrangement had been made with the captain of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>. Therefore it is difficult to
                            fix the price of whales.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> said that the contract indicates
                            that the captain had a share of the catch. He asks if the risks that are
                            run can be insured to the contractor who paid the money to the
                            captain.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Clifford</hi> said that only the cargo—that is
                            to say, the bone and oil which are aboard the vessel—is insured. The
                            premium is 6 per cent per season.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> said that the affair of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> may be considered as closed.</p>
                        <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0446"/>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Clifford</hi> and Captain <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Baker</hi> asked permission to withdraw.</p>
                        <p>The parties and the arbitrator have no objection.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> said that the affair of the
                            whaler being closed, it is now time to consider the questions as to best
                            season for sealing, the length of the season, and the date of the
                            beginning and the ending of the sealing season.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> said that the season of the
                            regular catch of seals on the landings of the Commander Islands is
                            chiefly during the months of June and July and sometimes half of the
                            month of August. Sometimes sealing is begun again by certain sealers in
                            the month of September. The herds begin to arrive at their grounds on
                            the islands in the month of May. Toward June the families, or harems,
                            are formed, and in July the season of sexual life is at its height. It
                            continues to August and September, so that the young are born in from
                            four to five months. Toward October the migration begins, and the
                            greater part of the herd departs to winter in the south.</p>
                        <p>He thinks that further details could be given by Mr. Townsend.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked if the young are brought
                            forth in mid seas or upon ground.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi>. They come ashore expressly for
                            the purpose of bringing forth upon the islands. The females come there
                            to give birth to their young. The nursing of the young follows quickly
                            after the birth. The females, again enceintes, go with the herd.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked if there is any essential
                            difference between the seals of the Pribilof and those of the Commander
                            islands (the American seals and the Russian), as is set forth in one of
                            the annexes of the American memorandum.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> said there is some difference
                            noticeable enough with regard to the conditions of life and nourishment,
                            but the animals are the same except for some very fine distinctions,
                            which are developed to some extent under the influence of the conditions
                            of life, these conditions, as regards the two races, not being
                            identical. These conditions, developed, so to speak, in the Darwinian
                            way, cause the zoologists of our day to distinguish the subspecies by
                            different scientific Latin names. It would be an exaggeration to say
                            that there is any very marked difference between these two species.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked if these differences, so
                            far as they exist, extend to the females and their habits.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi>. One may say no, unless it be in
                            the conditions of the surroundings and the food. The female seals come
                            ashore upon the islands to give birth to their young. For the time being
                            they are lazy and inactive. After the young are born and while they are
                            nursing, still watched over by the males, they seldom go out to sea. The
                            female seals never go to any great distance, and never to a distance of
                            6 miles from Commander Islands, during the month of July and even the
                            beginning of August. They prefer to remain during that time on the
                            “rookeries.” The male seals remain during the months of June and July on
                            the islands.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> said that he noted of what has just
                            been said on the subject of female seals to show that the mother seals
                            on the Commander Islands do not go far to seek their food, which
                            constitutes a fact set forth by Mr. Grebnitsky in his memorial entitled
                            New Data <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0447"/>on the Life of Fur
                            Seals. This fact agrees entirety with the indications of the line of
                            marine depths (<hi rend="italic">J. H. L.</hi> log book, p. 5). He adds
                            that Mr. Townsend’s charts confirm the opinion of Mr. Grebnitsky.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> claimed the privilege of giving
                            this memoir set forth in Russian to the arbitrator. In continuing he
                            says that according to the American publications already presented it
                            appears from the log books of the schooners that the more the sealing is
                            in the proximity of the shore in July and August, the more females are
                            there killed. In the month of August the young females appearing upon
                            the islands are not yet reproducing (<hi rend="italic">J. H. L</hi>. log
                            book, p. 5); moreover, on the chart of maritime enterprise in fur
                            sealing drawn up in 1883 and 1893 by Townsend, it is seen that in the
                            month of July near the Commander Islands seals are hunted nearer shore

                        <p>At the request of Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi>, Mr. <hi
                                rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> submitted that chart to the
                            arbitrator, as well as another chart, entitled “Map of the western
                            portion of Behring Sea,” by Leonhard Steineger, 1896, on which are
                            marked the places where sealing is done around Commander Islands and
                            upon which certain directions of the course of the schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> are marked. It was not
                            possible to indicate all of them, the chart ending at 175° east
                            longitude (<hi rend="italic">J. H. L.</hi> log book, p. 2).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> continued: In the Senate Document
                            No. 137, Part II, Fifty-seventh Congress, first session, there are
                            annexed three charts of Bering Sea and of the northern part of the
                            Pacific, indicating the points where the sealing industry was carried on
                            in 1883–1893 (Chart I), for 1893, and 1894, and in these charts no
                            indication is found of facts of sealing relating to the longitudes and
                            latitudes alleged by the schooner <hi rend="italic">Hamilton Lewis</hi>.
                            The data which served in the composition of the charts was borrowed from
                            the log books of the American, Canadian, and English schooners (<hi
                                rend="italic">J. H. L.</hi> log book, p. 2), adding that Colonel
                            Woloschinow (1885) claims the same thing on the subject of the habits of
                            seals, Townsend says the same, as does also Prosorow in his publication
                            in the Russian language, Brief Sketch of the Okhotsk and Kamtschatka
                            Regions (St. Petersburg, 1902), Sawitsch (report for 1893), and Dr.
                            Slumine (Industrial Resources of Kamtschatka and the Commander Islands,
                            1895). These works have been remitted, besides that of Sawitsch and
                            Woloschinow.</p>
                        <p>Examination of charts, with designation of the parts of the sea where
                            seals are taken in the pelagic sealing at different periods of the year,
                            and the migration habits of seals.</p>
                        <p>Three charts were handed to the arbitrator.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> showed on the chart (Western
                            portion of Behring Sea, by Leonhard Stejneger, 1896) the places where
                            pelagic sealing is carried on around Commander Islands, and on which are
                            marked the course of the schooner <hi rend="italic">Hamilton Lewis</hi>.
                            It was, however, impossible to mark the whole course, the chart ending
                            at 175° east longitude.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> again asked Mr. Kroupsky about
                            the taking of the mother seals in pelagic sealing; if it is possible to
                            distinguish from a distance whether the animal is male or female.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> said that the females are very
                            easily distinguished by their relatively small bodies. The males having
                            attained mature <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0448"/>age (about 4
                            years), are nearly twice as large as the females, and nothing is more
                            simple than to differentiate at sight, even at a considerable
                            distance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi> said that sometimes some females
                            go out to distance of 200 miles from shore. It is then possible to
                            presume that the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> could have
                            taken all of the skins of female seals in mid seas, even at the period
                            stated.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> observed that according to what
                            has been said in the arbitration of Paris, the places where female seals
                            seek their food are much more distant.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> answered that at the arbitration of
                            Paris it was a question of American seals of the islands of Pribilof. It
                            is now a question of the seals around the Russian islands of Commander,
                            of which the conditions of life are slightly different by reason of the
                            places where they find their food. The Russian and American waters
                            differ as regards depths and character.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that this does not relate to
                            the present matter (to the question of the sealing of the <hi
                                rend="italic">J. H. L.</hi>).</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> is of different opinion. It is a
                            question of the value of the statements that there is a difference
                            between females of the Pribilof Islands and those of the Commander
                            Islands and between the depths about those islands. He stated that it
                            has been said by Mr. Kroupsky that it was impossible to find female
                            seals at a distance of 5 or 6 miles from the Commander Islands, and asks
                            if the professor can produce documents to prove it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> insisted that it is impossible to
                            find in the said season female seals in predominating quantity around
                            the Commander Islands. He sustained his deposition by a citation from an
                            American source. (Stejneger.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that it can not be admitted
                            that it would be impossible to find female seals in the North Pacific
                            between the longitudes where the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi> passed. He wishes further explanations on that
                            allegation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> particularized, and said that some
                            females can be found in midocean. If it is on the one hand incontestible
                            that seals are never met with between longitude 171° and 185°, on the
                            other hand it may be said that sometimes, by chance of nature and within
                            the zoological possibility, exceptions may be found, but very rarely.
                            For instance, animal species which are only found in certain climates or
                            places which are their proper homes, or where zoologically they belong,
                            can be accidentally met with in unique and, so to speak, erratic
                            examples in regions where one would not expect to find them in their
                            normal condition. Thus it is with seals, as with all other sorts of
                            living things—the possibility of an accidental appearance in regions
                            where they are generally never found. I admit that accidental
                            possibility, but I do not believe that in such regions it would be a
                            question of hunting erratic individual seals, at least not without
                            running the risk of taking but one or two in a long time. Consequently,
                            it is very difficult to suppose that the <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis</hi> could have taken that proportion of 90 per cent
                            of female seal skins precisely in the regions so exceptional for that
                            purpose, viz, the great distance of the place from Medny Island, and
                            still more the fact that the sealing must have taken place in the
                            longitudes between Attu and the Adakes.</p>
                        <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0449"/>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> drew attention to the fact that 90
                            per cent of mother seals had been taken. The mention made in the
                            memorandum of the party opposed to the deposition of Mr. Morgan as to
                            how that circumstance would prove that the skins were taken from animals
                            killed in mid sea is not justified. What Mr. Morgan said must be
                            otherwise interpreted. He had simply stated that that lot of skins had
                            been taken from mother seals, but in his deposition he made no statement
                            that this would serve as proof that sealing had been done in mid seas.
                                (<hi rend="italic">J. H. L.</hi>, log book, p. 5.)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked about the hibernating
                            places of seals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> said that the places of
                            hibernating are always in the sea. It has never been remarked that seals
                            spend the winter on land or on other islands. The winter “sealing
                            grounds” are not known. The seals go into the depths of the sea. It is
                            difficult to determine in an exact manner the places of hibernation in
                            the sea. What is known is merely the migration of the herds, which go at
                            the approach of winter toward the south; those of the Commander Islands
                            in the direction of Japan; those of the Pribilof Islands in the
                            direction of San Francisco.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> produced a marine chart to
                            establish that, according to the log book, the captain had taken seals
                            in longitude where they never come.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that this point should have
                            been refuted in the memorandum, and that it is not a question to be
                            discussed here.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> was of opinion that all liberty
                            should be accorded to the delegate from Russia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> found that that relates to the
                            supplementary information, and says the Report of Fur Seal Investigation
                            of 1896–97, Part I, page 44, reads— <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The fur seals of the North Pacific comprise three distinct herds,
                                    which do not intermingle in any way, having distinct breeding
                                    grounds, feeding grounds, and routes of migration.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In the same Report, Part III, in the article of Charles H. Townsend,
                            “Pelagic sealing” (p. 234 and following), it reads: <quote

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Having examined on the chart the directions indicated in the log book of
                            the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> from the 13th July, it
                            appears that the schooner took fur seals in latitudes and longitudes in
                            which fur seals have never been found by anybody. One concludes
                            therefrom that if the schooner indicated in an exact manner her sojourn
                            in those latitudes and longitudes she could not have taken any seal
                            skins, and that the skins had been taken elsewhere, and as it will be
                            shown further on, probably in the proximity of the Medny Island. (<hi

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> gave explanations on the chart,
                            and adds that the fact of the proximity to the shore, which explains the
                            possibility of taking a certain number of skins, 90 per cent female
                            seals, as is the case with the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi>, has become exceedingly common for the schooners of the
                            pelagic fleet. In the report of the chief of the district of the islands
                            of Commander for 1891 we read: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    supposing perhaps that the Imperial Government did not desire to
                                    put any obstacle in the way of their raids, the schooners in
                                    1890 and 1891 remained and sealed off the coasts of Medny
                                    Island, carefully remaining beyond the range of gunshot. In the
                                    places inaccessible for the inhabitants, or far from the
                                    principal landings, they sealed even upon the shores. Their
                                    audacity reached such a point that in 1891 the captains offered
                                    resistance to the war ships which were in those parts.</p>

                            considered as quite ordinary. (P. 226 of the Report, Part III.) Prior to
                            1892 the desultory sealing carried on about the Commander Islands
                            virtually amounted to sealing on the rookeries, the seals having been
                            taken in foggy weather close to the shores, or, when opportunity
                            afforded, on unguarded rookeries.</p>

                                    the territorial waters, adopted the tactics of keeping some

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi> said that he knew the chart which
                            was produced, but that it is not quite exact. He consulted another
                            marine chart to demonstrate where the seals are at different periods of
                            the year, and the route they follow during their migration. He said that
                            there is no reason for not admitting that seals had been taken in the
                            places indicated on the log book. (Pointing on the map, he said that it
                            was possible the <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> got the seals where she
                            claimed.)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked Mr. Townsend for
                            information with regard to sealing, and their habits.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Seals arrive from the Pacific in
                            a great body about July, in Bering Sea, and are present at the Pribilof
                            and Commander islands in July and August and till late in the fall. They
                            are found at all distances up to 200 miles from both groups of islands.
                            The males stay on the islands; the females bring forth young early in
                            July, and then, being hungry, nursing their young, they go away to feed.
                            Young males and very young females not under the same pressure for food,
                            not nursing, stay most of the time on land. Females go away out to sea,
                            where they can get the most food in the shortest time.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> (referring to p. 143) asked if
                            it is stated that males remain on ground, never eating.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. They become very hungry and thin.
                            I refer only to breeding males in the harems. They first come last of
                            May. From the time the big males take up their position they never eat
                            nor drink for two months. Then leaving the rookeries they go to sea very
                            little, sleep on sand beaches—seem to want to sleep for the first month
                            after their breeding duties are over. The young are born early in
                            July—they remain on rocks. They can’t swim till a month old. When the
                            females arrive they have young at once. They nurse them for five or six
                            days, till they come in heat and are then covered by the bulls. They
                            then go to sea. They go long distances and come back to nurse their
                            pups, and then go out again. Two hundred miles out I have caught <pb
                                n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0451"/>female seals in milk in July,
                            also in August and September. Sealing stops about the middle of
                            September on account of the weather.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> asked if he knew of any cases where
                            the young seals had been taken from the bodies of the mothers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi> said that sometimes in the month
                            of July on opening the bodies of female seals which come from the south,
                            little seals are found with hair on them; but after the month of August
                            the females have only milk in them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> asked if the <hi rend="italic">J. H.
                                L.</hi> could have taken during the voyage indicated in the log book
                            424 seals; or how many she could have taken without going within the 3
                            miles.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. These are all late June and July
                            dates except August 1. The American seal herd enters through the passes
                            out to sea, 172°. The <hi rend="italic">J. H. L.</hi> landed her winter
                            catch in Alaska. She could have found good sealing in the neighborhood
                            in July. There should be an abundance of seals going through passes at
                            this date.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. What could the <hi rend="italic">J.
                                H. L.</hi> have taken after August 1 without going within 3 or 5
                            miles of Russian land?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Good sealing in Bering Sea around
                            both American and Russian islands at great distance from islands—out to
                            200 miles. Sealers working free outside 60 miles protected zone around
                            Pribilof.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> asked if it is probable or
                            possible that the <hi rend="italic">J. H. L</hi>. could have taken so
                            large a number of seals in the waters indicated in the memorandum on the
                            high seas.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked the same question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> said in the United States Fish and
                            Fisheries Commission, Part XVIII, page ci, we read: <quote

                        <p>This mention relates to the year 1892, that is to say to an epoch close
                            to the confiscation of the schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi>, and it does not establish any really determined data as

                            shores, that which was only executed in 1896. It was up to that time
                            that the log book and the sealing account was most likely made.</p>
                        <p>In the United States Fish and Fisheries Commission, in the article “The
                            Russian fur-seal islands,” was produced a chart of the fur sealing about
                            the Commander Islands, which is annexed to the fourth part of the report
                            of fur-seal investigation. From the data therein, borrowed from the
                            American official publications, it appears that from the 141° longitude
                            east to 175° longitude west—that is to say, over an extent of 14
                            degrees—there are no herds of fur seals, and if there were any of these
                            animals it could only be a sporadic case, analogous to the phenomena
                            which relates to the development of the life of all sea animals in
                            general, while the schooner notes the catch of a large quantity of seals
                            in those parts. Moreover, there must necessarily have been seals of the
                            American herds, which are noticeably distinct from those of the Asiatic
                            waters, as it was well known then by all who were Interested in the
                            sealing industry. The fact of the presence of that sort of skins could
                            not escape the attention of an expert in those matters, such as Mr.
                            Morgan, who, concurrently with the administration <pb n="426"
                                xml:id="pg_426" facs="0452"/>of the islands in question, examined
                            all of the skins for the purpose of determining the percentage of female
                            skins (mothers), which required a very minute examination. Thus all of
                            the skins were recognized to have been taken from the Asiatic herds, the
                            limits of which is marked at 171°. The sealing account (pp. 213, 214)
                            does not quite agree with the chart now presented.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. The log book does not indicate
                            precisely where seals were taken. In a few cases it gives the
                            places.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi> (p. 214). Seals referred to were
                            taken from 170° to 177° longitude west. There is no reason why seals
                            should not have been taken here; 169° to 172° east longitude, latitude
                            50° 30’ to 52° 40’ are points on migration track and on border of
                            sealing ground. They claimed to have killed last seal from 24th to 30th
                            of July at this point (pointing to map). There is no reason why he
                            should not have taken seals here.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. You have data showing catch of
                            seals in August and September?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Yes, a great many. In August
                            there is good sealing; July, ditto; September, all right, if doesn’t
                            blow too hard, up to 20th.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. How many seals could well-equipped
                            sealer take in August and the usual part of September?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. There is a great difference in
                            vessels. A first-class, well-found vessel with an energetic master could
                            pick up, I suppose, from 1,500 to 2,500 seals from August 1 to September
                            15. I have known vessels to pick up 1,800 during August.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. Do you consider <hi
                                rend="italic">J. H. L.</hi> a good vessel?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">J. H.
                                L.</hi> was of good size, of larger class. Thirty to 40 tons would
                            be about the smaller class. The <hi rend="italic">J. H. L.</hi> was of
                            73 to 75 tons.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>, correcting, said 78 tons.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> said that the color of the seals
                            fading toward the end of August the price of the skins taken at that
                            time must be lower.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. I do not think so. The pelagic
                            catch is the same in winter and summer, and there is no reason why
                            August and September skins should not be the same.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Might it not be that seals living
                            on land will be differently affected by season than are seals on the
                            high seas?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Undoubtedly. The best time to
                            kill on land is in July to early August. The pelagic catch consists of
                            skins taken when and where you can get your hands on them. Male seals on
                            the islands are best in July and August.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked the Russian expert, Mr.
                            Grunwaldt, if the seals taken in the last months of the territorial
                            catch, viz, the months of August and September, are equivalent or
                            inferior as merchandise to the seals taken during the height of
                            season.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grunwalt</hi> said that that makes a difference
                            of 75 per cent for the seals which have been killed in the month of
                            September. The skins of the American herd have the greater value.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> stated that according to Mr.
                            Grunwaldt there is a difference for pelagic sealing, 60 to 75 per
                            cent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> said that there is no essential
                            difference between the pelagic seal and the territorial. They are the
                            same animals, not only <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0453"/>from the
                            point of view of the different seasons of their life, but also from that
                            of the character and significance of chase. The pelagic sealing is not
                            regular sealing; it injures the industry of both the two
                            parties—American and Russian—equally. The territorial industry,
                            organized in conformity with the zoological conditions of the species,
                            is the only reasonable one. It gives besides the best product as to
                            quality. Pelagic sealing should be interdicted in the interest of the
                            preservation of seals, for which we are responsible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Fur dealers will take seals of
                            different ages and caught at different times. How can you tell whether
                            the skins were taken in September or August?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grunwaldt</hi> maintained that the merchants can
                            see.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. I am not aware that any
                            difference exists.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked Mr. Townsend what must be
                            understood by “pelagic sealing.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>, Sealing on the high seas from
                            vessels, but the Russian and American Governments take some male seals
                            on the islands; this is not “pelagic.” Killing on land means killing of
                            the surplus males by the Governments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. On the groups of islands where the
                            seal rookeries are, owned by Russia and the United States, are there not
                            two companies, one for each group, which control seal killing?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. They have the lease. The
                            Governments control killing and prescribe how many seals shall be
                            killed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. What do they kill?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Three-year-old males.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Where and how do they pass the
                            summer?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. They stay close to islands. The
                            Government kills on island; they are not very much in water.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Is it your impression that a fur
                            seal most of the summer out of water would be in the same condition in
                            September as a seal that had been during that time swimming in the
                            Bering Sea?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. The fur is under the hair; the
                            female may change color slightly, but the fur underneath is the
                            same.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. After the seals are caught and skin
                            taken off, what is done with the skins before they are put on the fur
                            market as a finished article?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. They are plucked and dyed before
                            being manufactured.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Would color make much difference if
                            they are dyed?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. No. Skins are graded by age and
                            size; not by season of catch.</p>
                        <p>The session adjourned to Monday morning at 10 o’clock.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Session of Monday morning, June 30,
                                1902.</hi></p>
                        <p>The session opened at 10 o’clock a.m.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> said that he would now consider
                            the second and and third questions; that is to say, of the valuation of
                            the probable catch during the remainder of the season and the value of
                            the skins. He states that the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                                Lewis</hi> was seized on the 2d August, 1891, and the <hi
                                rend="italic">White</hi> on the 15th July, 1892. The arbitrator
                            again repeated that he asks the questions without prejudicing the cases.
                                <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0454"/>The probable catch of the
                                <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> for a stated time must
                            be estimated from the 2d August to the end of the season and for the <hi

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> stated that the publication which
                            the defendant party wished to hand to the arbitrator is not signed,
                            consequently is valueless as evidence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi>. In handing certain publications to
                            the arbitrator and to the opponent party, I do so only to prove the
                            passage I read and which bears upon the question treated. The
                            publication is only a reminder to facilitate the memory of what has been
                            said by me. As for the title of this publication it need not be
                            considered.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> said it is now a question of the
                            number of seals which the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>
                            could have taken.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi>. An average can be taken from the
                            entire number of seals that are ordinarily caught at that time of year.
                            The number of seals taken on Commander Islands does not exceed 15,000
                            per season during the last years. The sealing season lasts about ten
                            weeks, consequently the catch per diem is about 200 head or a little
                            over. For the seal catch in a stated time by pelagic sealing vessels we
                            must refer to Mr. Townsend.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> stated that Mr. Grebnitsky, on the
                            basis of American documents, has collected a certain amount of data on
                            the number of seal skins taken by vessels engaged in sealing, and that
                            is why Mr. Kroupsky insists that the vessels could not have taken 2,600
                            seal skins, as is alleged by the party claimant. The sealing season
                            ceases in the last third of the month of August, after which the skins
                            have little value, because their color fades. According to the figures
                            for 1894 (Report on Fur Seal Investigation) near the Commander Islands,
                            37 schooners took 7,688 skins; according to the figures for 1893, 38
                            schooners took on the side of Russian territory 12,052 skins. According
                            to the figures for 1892, 87 schooners took 17,242 skins, but that figure
                            includes the sealing on the Japan shores (by English vessels). On page
                            262 of the Report, Part III, it is shown that all the sealing in 1891
                            was done in the Asiatic waters; there were taken 8,432 skins, of which
                            6,616 were the catch of English vessels and 1,826 of American
                            vessels.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> protested against the introduction
                            of a deposition by Mr. Grebnitsky, an expert who is not present.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> said that each State can name
                            the expert it wants, thus Mr. Komarow could have been named in the
                            capacity of expert. In an arbitration between States it is of far
                            greater interest than in purely juridical proceedings to draw forth all
                            evidence, whether direct or indirect, which may serve to give full
                            light.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that as Mr. Grebnitsky is not
                            present he can not be cross-examined.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> observed that the hearing of the
                            experts by the arbitrator could have taken place without the presence of
                            the other party.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> again said that it can not be known
                            whether the deposition of Mr. Grebnitsky is entirely correct. The
                            document in question was prepared by him for his own Government.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> said that he will take into
                            consideration that the figures have not been discussed. Besides, he
                            states that in the affair <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0455"/>of
                            the <hi rend="italic">Costa Rica Packet</hi> Mr. de Martens sat at
                            Brussels and discussed with the experts. A debate with the experts did
                            not take place.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>, after having again stated that Mr.
                            Grebnitsky was obliged to make as favorable report as possible to his
                            Government, he says that he will submit to the decision of the
                            arbitrator. He wishes, however, that his protest be inserted in the
                            verbal proceedings.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> said again that these are not
                            evidence, and that it is to the interest of both parties not to be too
                            strict as to form. He will, however, take account of what the delegate
                            of the United States says.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that in his opinion it was not
                            a question of form, but of figures. He found himself in an unfortunate
                            position, since it was impossible to ask Mr. Grebnitsky for
                            explanations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> believed that credence should be
                            given to the work of Mr. Grebnitsky, who has been charged by the United
                            States Senatorial Commission to give its opinion on these questions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi>. The sealing statistics are
                            published each year. The figures for the years preceding 1894 are
                            sometimes twice as large as for the years following after 1894.</p>
                        <p>He produced the figures. He set forth in a few words that besides the
                            allegation in question a matter of much greater gravity is involved. It
                            is question of the preservation of seals in which Russia and the United
                            States are involved.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that question is not now under
                            consideration; this session is not a scientific reunion.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> stated that the professor first
                            said 15,000, but from the statistics which he now hands to him it is
                            33,000. Consequently, the figures must be changed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> said that what he is speaking of
                            relates to the regularly organized sealing on the sealing ground. As for
                            pelagic sealing, he refers to Mr. Townsend.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi>. The name of Mr. Grebnitsky,
                            whatever may be his personal value as expert, vanishes before the fact
                            which he cites, and we also, the American figures. He reiterated that
                            according to the United States official documents the total number of
                            seals captured by the 37 British vessels (including the six confiscated)
                            was 17,242 head in 1892, being an average of about 460 skins per
                            schooner. The English vessels, according to the United States data, are
                            always more lucky in sealing. In the number above mentioned are included
                            five schooners which sealed also in the Japanese waters. The greatest
                            number of seals (900) was captured by the schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >Sayward</hi>, but that schooner sealed on the coast of Medny
                            Island. The greater part of the schooners captured from 200 to 400
                            each.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked Mr. Grunwaldt if he had
                            anything more to add to what has been said regarding the number of seals
                            which could; have been killed after the 2d of August.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grunwaldt</hi> said that Townsend and Grebnitsky
                            are savants equally recognized as competent by both America and Russia;
                            neither their honor nor their competence can be questioned, even though
                            they are in the service of the Government. He admits entirely the
                            figures of Grebnitsky.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked Mr. Townsend as to the
                            probable catch of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> and
                            the <hi rend="italic">C. H. Wliite</hi> from August 2.</p>
                        <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0456"/>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi> said that the average is 600 per
                            diem, which makes 1,800 in one month. The following data were given by
                            him: For 1886, schooner <hi rend="italic">Mary Ellen</hi>, 961 seals in
                            fifteen days in the month of August; for 1887, schooner (Canadian) <hi

                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, took 1,800 seals in
                            eighteen days in the month of August; for 1895, the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Savannah</hi>, 1,200 seals in twenty-three days. According to him
                            the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> could have taken 1,000
                            (according to the note of Mr. Garrett, 2,000; according to those of
                            Messrs. Gutowski and Roëll, 1,000) seals after the 2d of August. Seals
                            were not decreasing in 1891, 1892, and 1893 as much as later on; the
                            restrictions of Paris tribunal affected the sealing. Subsequent to 1892
                            fewer were taken. Pelagic sealing has never been so good since Paris
                            tribunal.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. You say there was no decrease
                            in 1892?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. No apparent decrease. Seals were
                            very numerous at sea in 1890; fewer seals killed on islands by
                            Governments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> remarked that Mr. Townsend had
                            cited exceptional cases and not an average figure.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked Mr. Townsend for the
                            average figures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi> said that it is necessary to make
                            a difference between large and small schooners. He considers the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, of 60 tons and more, a
                            large vessel.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked why large vessels catch
                            more seals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Because they have more boats and
                            more sealers.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked him the number of the
                            crew.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi> said 20 to 25 men—2 men to each
                            boat.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked how many boats the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> had.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. May I read the crew list and ask
                            Mr. Townsend how many boats she probably had?</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. Certainly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> read from page 121.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Six hunters. In fair weather all
                            able-bodied men, even captain and mate, would be put to work and would
                            go along. There are, say 9 or 10 boats. In addition to the regular
                            hunting boats they have one or two other boats. The schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">Swan</hi> took over 1,084 seals in Bering Sea in
                            twenty-three days in 1895 with spears alone. One can take three times as
                            many seals with guns as with spears. There was a special inducement to
                            hunting, because prices were higher in 1890 to 1892 than ever before or
                            since. A white crew is better than an Indian one, because it takes more
                            risks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> recalled the passage of the report
                            wherein it is said that the average catch of seals per season was, in
                            1892, 460 head per vessel.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked what the Russian
                            Government did with the <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> and the <hi
                                rend="italic">White.</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> produced documents which relate to
                            the sale of the schooners.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> asked Mr. Townsend several
                            questions.</p>
                        <p>There were a good many classes and kinds of vessels in Bering Sea, were
                            there not?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Many kinds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Some were very small?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Yes; one was only 18 tons.</p>
                        <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0457"/>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Some were vessels not only small,
                            but of little value?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Yes, all possible kinds; some
                            worthless.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Some not worth sailing away after
                            seizure?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Yes; they were allowed to rot on
                            the beach.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. The equipment varies, does it
                            not?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Yes; some is good, some poor. At
                            that time everybody wanted to go sealing. There were a hundred and fifty
                            vessels in the fleet at that time. All old tubs were sailing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Is there not a great difference in
                            the equipment?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. The vessels of the same size have
                            different equipments?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Yes; it depends on the
                            owners.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Was the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Lewis</hi>, with 8 or 9 boats, an average vessel, or was she better
                            equipped than the average?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. She was quite up to the average
                            of her size—75 or 80 tons; she was a good average sealing vessel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> read statement of what she had on
                            board (p. 138).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. She strikes me as being above the
                            usual outfit. I fitted out a schooner myself once. She seems to have
                            been well equipped to feed a white crew for a ten months’ cruise.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. She was likely to get better than
                            an average catch?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. The equipment indicates the class
                            of men she carried.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. With such a manifest she was likely
                            to have people above the average?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Some ships were larger than the <hi
                                rend="italic">Lewis?</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Would they necessarily have more
                            boats?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Perhaps.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Alexander MacLean had reputation of
                            bringing in a good catch?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Is it equitable to estimate the
                            possible catch of <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> on basis of all ships
                            engaged in Bering Sea that year?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. No, for they include a number of
                            small vessels not amounting to much.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Can you give an average of the
                            larger ships?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Yes; I have the log books or
                            copies of them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> stated that the delegate of the
                            United States questions the American experts. He asks what is the mode
                            of procedure. He agreed that the questions to the American experts be
                            asked in English, but requested that the answers be translated. He also
                            reserves the right to question the Russian experts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> agreed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> took note of it.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> again stated that it is not
                            question of furnishing evidence. The questions are asked to enlighten
                            the arbitrator. It is he who first questions, then the delegates may
                            question the experts of both parties. It is very difficult to determine
                            whether there will be any difference from a juridical point of view
                            between the answers given by the experts to the questions of the
                            arbitrator and those of the delegates. The procedure in international
                            arbitrations is not yet established.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi>. Would like to know with regard to
                            the provisioning of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>. If
                            the amount of her provisions would warrant the supposition that the
                            vessel could have continued sailing a long time.</p>
                        <p>The session adjourned until 3 o’clock p.m.</p>

                        <p>The session opened at 3 o’clock p.m.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi>, apropos of the provisions of the
                                <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, of which it was
                            question in the preceding session, and which he thought ought to
                            demonstrate the importance of the vessel, cited the following figures,
                            according to page 228 of the Report, Volume III. The vessel <hi
                                rend="italic">Emma and Louise</hi> in 1893 had $1,500 worth of
                            provisions for the season from February. This vessel was of greater
                            tonnage than the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>. The <hi
                                rend="italic">Alton</hi> had $1,400 worth of provisions; the <hi
                                rend="italic">Therese</hi> $1,281 worth. The <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis</hi> went to sea on the 7th March; that is to say
                            that five months’ of her supplies had been consumed when she was seized;
                            she should have had enough left for one month and a half or two months,
                            which was not the case, because she had been insufficiently
                            supplied.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that that list was consulted
                            merely to ask Mr. Townsend whether a schooner thus provisioned was a
                            first-class vessel or a small schooner such as the Indians used.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> contested that from the figures
                            presented it was a first-class vessel.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked the experts if they have
                            anything further to say with regard to the probable catch.<note n="a"
                                xml:id="d34fn1">See morning session.</note></p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that unfortunately Mr. Townsend
                            is not provided for the moment, as he believed this morning he would be,
                            with the data necessary to establish an average. He cites Volume VIII,
                            page 846, Fur Seal Arbitration. The arbitrator may hereby see that
                            Canadian vessels have taken large numbers of seals. These vessels are
                            not as well equipped as American vessels, for they usually have Indian
                            crews.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> wished to cite page 228 of the

                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> said it is now a question of the

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> called attention to the fact that
                            the figures are not given in detail.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> agreed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> asked if the company had been
                            allowed a commission on the sale of the skins.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> stated that the office of the
                            Russian Seal Company on the 13th January simply says that the sale had
                            been made on commission.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grunwaldt</hi>. The company had not received
                            brokerage or commission on its profits, but naturally commission had to
                            be paid to the public auction house at London (commission, storage,
                            etc., Maison Laopson).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that 690 skins had been thrown
                            aside as being of small value. It is evident that there were 562 skins,
                            but it is not shown that they were the skins from the <hi rend="italic"
                                >C. H. White.</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> agreed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said Document II does not give the
                            price, and simply mentions the sale; Document III gives the price, but
                            makes no mention of the number of the skins. It shows that according to
                            the documents the price of one skin was $10.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked Grunwaldt the average
                            price.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grunwaldt</hi>, speaking in English, said: Seals
                            have different prices. It depends on the question of how many people
                            want to buy and how many skins are on the market and at different places
                            at same time, I ask you to agree with me. In the seal business the whole
                            world has London prices. Russians and Americans have seals, but they
                            have agencies who are English people. They are very highly placed in
                            whole world (named companies). If they say that market is so and so, I
                            agree they don’t lie. After thirty or forty years’ connection with seal
                            market, I can decide intelligently. We can’t say prices; those people
                            can who get paid from those people. They have not received skins now,
                            and they have given money to Government; wish not in America nor in
                            Russia to speak about this family thing of prices, but I must say that
                            if price in London is £1 or 1 ruble, this price is not a price first
                            stipulated as in form of law. Two different prices, regular and
                            irregular. Regular price, that which Government gets from commercial
                            agent party, who has the franchise; irregular price, that which people
                            get when they get back to San Francisco in selling bundles of 200 skins.
                            If this man can wait, he can get more money. Russia Seal Skin Company
                            House, before it started there were more American than Russian in this
                            business, more a form of politics. Russia gave to a party for twenty
                            years a franchise from price of 75 k. or 1.50 for as many seals as they
                            could catch. Aleut take seals in name of agency. After this thing which
                            Alexander III by Russian people to give franchise to Russian society,
                            all things were changed horrible, this (each will laugh) contract;
                            people could not go to islands with schooners; had to arrange with
                            somebody to get things from islands; now as I know family history, I say
                            that name Morgan and his agent were at different times after Russian
                            franchise was given in the islands to receive these things when they
                            first came; the people had no idea that change had been made; they gave
                            all they had in land to Morganites; received in name of late contract.
                            They make arrangement with Lampson to help them <pb n="434"
                                xml:id="pg_434" facs="0460"/>out; hold back skins; otherwise prices
                            would be this year zero. This is truth, though we have seen such high
                            prices as T. stated this morning. In these prices are different
                            qualities, making average. Twelve per cent discount for expenses of
                            Lampson. 1882 to 1891 prices were 42s. for first-class Commander Islands
                            Iseals. 1892 to 1899, 60s. It is shown this is not price at all that
                            they received, because this is a price of occasion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. So that they may have received
                            more?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grunwaldt</hi>. Never in life! Skins taken, some
                            worse than others.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> stated that it has been said
                            that the seal skins of these schooners could have been sold at London
                            for $14.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grunwaldt</hi> said that the 416 skins had been
                            sold at London for £786 14s. 3d., as it appears from the Russian
                            official documents now presented. This price could not have been
                            obtained by the ship owners, if the skins had been sold by them, whereas
                            the cost of transport and of the sale at auction would have been
                            considerable. The sealing grantees of the Commander Islands had a
                            contract with the railroad and the navigation companies at reduced
                            prices for the transportation of seal skins, and, by an arrangement with
                            Lampson &amp; Co., they paid a smaller tax (7 per cent) than the
                            ordinary tax (11 per cent) for the rights of storage and sale of
                            skins.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that Mr. Komarow has suggested
                            that the owners of the schooners would not have received the same prices
                            as the Russian seal companies, for the latter have agreements with the
                            railroads. This is impossible, for it is forbidden to the railroad
                            companies of the United States. He added that the price of freight could
                            not exceed $1 per skin.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grunwaldt</hi> explained that nevertheless there
                            are agreements with railroad companies and the agents. It is a
                            commercial secret; the cost of transportation in such cases is
                            diminished 50 per cent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> protested and said that it is
                            impossible; the interstate commerce law prohibits railroads from making
                            a special contract with individuals or societies; they must give the
                            same prices to everybody for same class of goods. The sea freight is a
                            small item. The price at London is established by documents of Russia at
                            $ 15—and it can’t be more than $1 for the transport and care of the
                            furs. Not so much.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> explained how with us a
                            reduction for the large transportations is possible. There are special
                            tariffs which must be published.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. The price of cars is the same to
                            everybody.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> returned to the question of
                            prices. He states that $15 per seal skin was received at St. Petersburg.
                            The price ought to be still higher in London.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grunwaldt</hi> replied that that price was
                            exceptional. The ordinary prices are less. Moreover a skin taken in
                            pelagic sealing has an entirely different value from a skin taken by the
                            companies who pay franchise rights to the Governments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> said that the prices are entirely
                            different for regular and irregular sales. It can be recognized whether
                            a skin has been legally or illegally taken.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked if the seal-skin business
                            is carried on by agents or brokers.</p>
                        <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0461"/>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grunwaldt</hi>. The legally constituted
                            enterprises, as well as individuals working independently, send the
                            skins to the firm of Lampson at London, who puts upon them the necessary
                            marks and assorts them. He showed the key. The firm of Lampson makes
                            advances to the customers who send them skins.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked if seal skins are quoted
                            in the London Exchange.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grunwaldt</hi>. No; it is a private affair of
                            the firm of Lampson, who moreover gives a report to its clients upon the
                            auction returns.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> read a report of the consul-general
                            at New York of the year 1891. It reads: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>I have been informed through confidential sources by persons well
                                    posted in the affairs of the new American exploitation company
                                    (North American Company), which has leased the Pribilof Islands,
                                    that one of the members of that company, Mr. Liebes, without the
                                    consent of the other partners, knowing that the number of skins
                                    to be taken in the eastern waters is limited to 5,500, sent
                                    marauding vessels into Russian waters.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked Mr. Townsend what was the
                            price of skins in London in 1892.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Seal skins are roughly divided
                            into three classes, Pribilof, Commander, and pelagic. Pelagic are those
                            killed in the Pacific hunt or even near the islands, if taken by pelagic
                            sealers. Skins taken on the islands are specially prepared and of high
                            value. In 1890 to 1892 all kinds were high priced, both those taken on
                            land and in water, higher than before or since. The Pribilof are the
                            highest priced, Commanders next, pelagic lowest. Pribilovs, sold in
                            London as Alaskas, were worth in 1891 125s. Skins killed on the islands
                            are selected three-year old males. Pelagic are cheap skins. Skins from
                            Russian islands were worth 84s. Pelagic that year sold for 62s. in
                            London. The entire pelagic catch comes from the North Pacific. Those
                            from Lobos, Cape Horn, have nothing to do with these.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. Have you reports to show
                            this?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Yes; I was member of the United
                            States commission that drew up the report. The prices shown then were
                            the prices secured from Lampson and shown by the British side.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. Do you think there is a
                            difference in price of skins sold by a large company or by private
                            individuals?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. So far as I know prices of skins
                            in Pacific are not different from those in London. Returning sealers go
                            to Seattle, Port Townsend, San Francisco, Tacoma, and find from various
                            owners there what skins are worth. The prices on the coast are very
                            similar to prices in London. In 1895 there was a difference of $1
                            between San Francisco and London.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked if the prices varies
                            according as the skins are sold by the captains or companies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Skins are purchased in San
                            Francisco or Victoria by a few dealers who take many of the skins as
                            they come in. This business is carried on by three or four
                            companies.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. If the owners of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Lewis</hi> would have to sell the skins they caught
                            for themselves, could they have obtained the same price in London—as say
                            Lampson &amp; Co.?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. The Pacific coast prices were
                            very little less at any time than in London. There is a market in San
                            Francisco.</p>
                        <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0462"/>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. Are there papers that show that
                            San Francisco is a market?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. The statistical reports of the
                            United States Fishery Department show the prices paid in San Francisco.
                            [Mr. Townsend showed statistics for 1895. These statistics were placed
                            at the disposition of the arbitrator.]</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator. How</hi> are these obtained?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. They were obtained from masters
                            of vessels, and from owners.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. It is estimation, not
                            valuation?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. They are Government
                            statistics.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. How was that valuation
                            made?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. The figures are taken from the
                            books of owners, and the prices, too.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grunwaldt</hi> said that there is a seal-skin
                            market at San Francisco, and another in Russia. He contested that there
                            are but three sorts of seal skins, as Mr. Townsend said. The number of
                            qualities and subdivisions is far greater.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> stated that the skins taken at sea
                            have less value than those which are taken on shore.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Kroupsky</hi> said that the subdivision set
                            forth by Mr. Townsend is purely scientific, and does not relate to the
                            market classification.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. You stated that the prices on the
                            London market vary as regards the Copper, Alaska, and Northwestern
                            catches, were those average prices?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Yes; because the table shows the
                            catch taken as a whole.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. Where were they prepared?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. They are British.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. By whom made?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. By Lampson for Mr. Thompson.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. So they are prepared for the
                            information of someone who follows out a careful line of
                            investigation?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Is it not a common practice for
                            pelagic sealers to go into the Pacific coast market with his seals?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. It was.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Would he send his skins to London
                            himself on his own account, or sell them in San Francisco, Victoria,
                            Seattle, Port Townsend to one of the dealers?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. The whole catch is disposed of
                            there to dealers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. These prices were made from books
                            of dealers?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Yes; these prices were given
                            confidentially.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Suppose they had been public, was
                            there any influence to make the dealers put unusually high or
                            exaggerated prices on the skins?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. No; they are the natural prices
                            of the articles.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. If he did, wouldn’t it make the
                            owners of vessels who had skins to sell demand same prices?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Doubtless.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Whereas the dealers’ skins are sent
                            to London and sold there?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Yes.</p>
                        <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0463"/>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. The party who gave these prices
                            bought the skins to sell them again. If he had put too high prices on
                            these skins it would have hurt him in London.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. I thought you said the prices
                            were got from the owners only?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. The collectors of statistics
                            consult all sources, books, dealers in all fishing commodities, also
                            shipping companies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grumwaldt</hi> wanted to know the names of the
                            fur dealers who obtain their stock from the San Francisco market.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>, could not name any; he could only
                            name the vessels that have sold their skins at San Francisco.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> asked what were the proceeds of the
                            skins confiscated by the Russian Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi>. The confiscation took place at
                            sea, but that does not prejudice the value of the skins, which,
                            according to him, must have been taken in Russian territorial
                            waters.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grumwaldt</hi> insisted on the question whether
                            there are sealskin merchants in San Francisco, and asks Mr. Townsend to
                            name those merchants.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi> showed Mr. Grumwaldt the edition
                            “Pelagic sealing,” page 298, and adds that there are here in the list of
                            schooners that engaged in pelagic sealing about 12 vessels, namely: <hi
                                rend="italic">Bonanza, M. T. Dyer, Emma and Louise, Alton, E. E.
                                Webster, Herman, J. Eppinger, Kate and Anna, Kattler, Therese,
                                Bowhead</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Winchester.</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grumwaldt</hi> asked the arbitrator to ask Mr.
                            Townsend, seeing that the list contains also the name of <hi
                                rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>, what were the names of the owners
                            of some of these vessels.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi> replied that the owners of one
                            were Liebes &amp; Ladd, of San Francisco; Morgan, of Victoria, of
                            another.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Grumwaldt</hi>. Now that the name of Mr. Liebes
                            has been mentioned, it goes without saying what is the nature of that
                            market, and I have no more to say. He however asked still further
                            questions of Mr. Townsend.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> submitted some documents</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. You have seen seals killed on the
                            islands?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Many years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. How is it done?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. With clubs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Is there a difference between a
                            seal killed on the island who has been chased and one who has not been
                            alarmed?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Yes, the male seals are driven
                            from sealing grounds slowly so as not to heat them. Possibly one out of
                            a thousand that wandered might be spoiled.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Is it the same in the water?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Oh, no.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. The temperature of the water would
                            urevent overheating.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. I suppose so.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked if anyone has anything
                            further to say with regard to the price of skins. He addressed a letter
                            to Mr. Peirce, delegate of the United States, relating to the price of
                            the vessels <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">C. H. White.</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that he can give an answer
                            right away.</p>
                        <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0464"/>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> said he would nevertheless send
                            the letter this evening and the reply can be given to-morrow
                            morning.</p>
                        <p>The session ended at 5 o’clock, adjourning till to-morrow morning at 10
                            o’clock.</p>

                                1902</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The session opened at 10 o’clock.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> read the letter which he
                            addressed yesterday evening to delegate of the United States with regard
                            to the value of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> and of
                            the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White.</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> wished to answer at once verbally,
                            and if the delegate from Russia desired to answer, the defendant party
                            may do so in the course of a month.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> said that he would also reply
                            verbally, and admits the verbal reply of the party claimant.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that he would not produce
                            documents, but only a book. He was satisfied to leave the valuation to
                            the arbitrator. He stated that in the memorandum the estimate was not
                            made on the basis of the commercial value of vessels, but that the
                            place, the business, and the price of the cargo were taken into account.
                            After the arbitration of 1893 the United States paid for several English
                            vessels. He submitted that valuation to the arbitrator. (Fur Seal
                            Arbitration, vol. 8, pp. 845–849.) This citation is made solely for the
                            purpose of aiding the arbitrator to fix the amount. In Moore’s
                            International Arbitrations History, Volume I, page 960, we find how much
                            was paid.</p>
                        <p>He repeated that the valuation of the American Government is not based on
                            the commercial value; the business in which these vessels were engaged
                            was taken into account. The <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> was
                            constructed in 1887. The date of the construction of the <hi
                                rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> is not known.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> would not enter into the
                            examination of an English claim with regard to the seizure by Americans
                            of Canadian vessels. He stated, moreover, that the settlement of those
                            claims was the subject of a different sort of transactions between the
                            American and British Governments. He is satisfied to cite for the <hi
                                rend="italic">White</hi> the price of the vessels which more nearly
                            serve as precedents (<hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, price of the
                            newly constructed vessels.) The price of the <hi rend="italic">James
                                Hamilton Lewis</hi> and of her equipment is stated as being $25,000.
                            On page 228 of the Report, Volume III, are indicated the prices of the
                            sealing vessels and their equipments, according to the depositions of
                            the ship owners; from this data it appears that of vessels of 1 ton more

                        <p>The value of the barrels of mackerel and codfish is doubled and tripled
                            (the highest price for codfish is $4, 124 per ton, only for the best
                            quality).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that he did not know the
                            schooners named, but that to the value of the vessel must be added the
                            value of the equipment.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked Townsend if he can give
                            any supplementary information on the value of vessels.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Whaling and sealing had declined
                            by 1895.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. Yes, I understand so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. Did value include equipment?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. I don’t remember.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. How are the statistics
                            obtained?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Of the owners, and sometimes of
                            the masters.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. Is there always a fixed
                            relation between tonnage and value?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Contracts for building new
                            vessels are made according to tonnage. The value of sealing vessels was
                            set forth more fully in the Canadian reports. Canadians are more
                            extensively engaged in pelagic sealing than anyone else.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. What was the number of boats on
                            the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> and the <hi
                                rend="italic">White?</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. I do not know.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>. But you know the number of
                            hunters?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. Yes; vessels carrying white crews
                            carry a certain number of sealing boats and a couple of dingeys, which
                            are used in good weather.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>. You don’t know the age of the

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi>. No.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked the price of the barrels
                            of mackerel and codfish.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Townsend</hi> produces a report wherein the
                            prices are shown.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that as there is no data for
                            making the valuations he accepts for the mackerel and codfish the
                            valuation of the defendant party.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> asked the delegates if they have
                            anything more to say.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that on Friday he will give
                            information on one of the first questions of law asked by the
                            arbitrator.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> regretted that this information can
                            not be given to-day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that it was impossible; he
                            awaited an answer from his Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Roell</hi> moves to stop here.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi> said that for the experts the
                            affair can be considered <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0466"/>as
                            ended. For the question of law, it must be treated with somewhat wider
                            latitude.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi> consented with the reservation,
                            after it had been agreed, that if he wished to ask information from his
                            Government, when Mr. Peirce has communicated the information received
                            from his Government, a delay of twenty-four hours will be accorded.</p>
                        <p>The session is adjourned to Friday morning 10 o’clock.</p>

                            4.</hi></p>
                        <p>The session opened at 10 o’clock a.m.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi>, the delegate of the United States,
                            recalled that he had expressed during Tuesday morning’s session a desire
                            to give further information to the arbitrator, but that he had to await
                            a communication from his Government. He said:</p>
                        <p>“In the first session the arbitrator asked me, ‘What is the extent of
                            jurisdiction which the United States claim to-day in Bering Sea?’ and I
                            replied that the American Government now claims an extent of 3 miles. I
                            wished that this reply might be sustained by the Secretary of State, Mr.
                            John Hay. I am now in receipt of a dispatch, and in accordance with the
                            authority which I have received from the Secretary of State of the
                            United States, dated July 3, 1902, I repeat that the Government of the
                            United States claims, neither in Bering Sea nor in its other bordering
                            waters, an extent of jurisdiction greater than a marine league from its
                            shores, but bases its claims to jurisdiction upon the following
                            principle: The Government of the United States claims and admits the
                            jurisdiction of any State over its territorial waters only to the extent
                            of a marine league, unless a different rule is fixed by treaty between
                            two States; even then the treaty States alone are affected by the
                            agreement.”</p>
                        <p>He made this declaration of his Government in the capacity of agent and
                            counsel accredited to this court and especially instructed to make this
                            declaration.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Peirce said that he would hand a copy of this declaration to the
                            arbitrator.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Komarow</hi>, the delegate of Russia, asked if
                            this declaration was a universal application, and if there is no
                            exception made in favor of certain industries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> said that this declaration applies
                            to all cases. He said he would give a copy of it to the delegate of
                            Russia.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitrator</hi>, Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Asser</hi>, expressed his thanks to the two powers who have been
                            pleased to have done him the honor to confer upon him the office of
                            arbitrator. He complimented the two delegates upon the preparation of
                            the memorandum and the rejoinders, and assured them of his appreciation
                            of the supplementary information. He thanked the experts also. The task
                            of the Russian experts, who were obliged to express themselves in
                            another language, was particularly difficult. They, nevertheless, made
                            clear more than one point. He particularly thanked Mr. Charles Townsend,
                            who, by his works and his scientific knowledge, greatly facilitated the
                            task of the arbitrator. He thanked the secretaries also.</p>
                        <p>He said by the terms of the convention he would have to render his
                            decision within six months from to-day. He had, however, no intention of
                            delaying his decision for six months. After having reread <pb n="441"
                                xml:id="pg_441" facs="0467"/>all of the documents he would proceed
                            at once to the preparation of the award.</p>
                        <p>In concluding he expressed the hope that the result of the labor in which
                            they have here been engaged might consolidate the good relations between
                            the United States of America and Russia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peirce</hi> delivered the following speech:</p>
                        <p>“The object of our reunion in this hall being fulfilled, it is my very
                            agreeable duty to address a few words of thanks to the distinguished
                            arbitrator who kindly consented to judge between my country and its
                            friend, the great power of the north, whose illustrious sovereign has
                            added imperishable laurels to his crown by his initiative, the result of
                            which is the existence of this Permanent Court of Arbitration, whose
                            hall our sessions here have inaugurated in the use to which it is
                            destined. And I congratulate those who are assembled in this hall for
                            that end, as well as the two great powers, the parties in this
                            litigation, on having assisted at the baptism of this child of a great
                            destiny. I thank the Permanent Court of Arbitration for myself, as well
                            as for my Government for the privilege which has been accorded us.</p>
                        <p>“In thanking the honorable arbitrator, I pay homage to his perfect
                            impartiality, his indefatigable patience, and his remarkable
                            perspicacity. While I have greatly admired his qualities, of which each
                            day he has given us new proof, I can not say that they have surprised
                            me. When my Government proposed to the Russian Government to submit the
                            differences that existed between them to him it was because it
                            recognized in him these same qualities, together with a profound
                            knowledge of the principles of law and justice. And the Government of
                            the United States, as well as the individual claimants in this affair,
                            have intrusted their interests into his hands with perfect
                            confidence.</p>
                        <p>“To my colleague of Russia I wish to express my sincere thanks for his
                            unvarying courtesy toward me as well as toward the United States
                            experts. I congratulate the defendant party on the learning, tact, and
                            intelligence of the delegate it has selected.</p>
                        <p>“As for the affair, it rests in the hands of a just, reasonable, and
                            learned arbitrator, and, although no one knows what his decision will
                            be, I for my part know that it will be just and will do honor to his
                            great reputation.</p>
                        <p>“It is quite true, as my colleague has well said, that at the end of this
                            affair there will be neither conqueror nor conquered, but I wish to add
                            that the Goddess of Peace, mother of Arbitration, confer upon both the
                            contracting parties laurels more illustrious than those with which

                        <p>I, Nickolas A. Grebnitsky, Russian military chief of the Commander
                            Islands district, with the rank of colonel, make the following
                            statement:</p>
                        <p>I have been residing on the Commander Islands, and have directed all
                            sealing operations there for the last fifteen years, and during this
                            whole period have been absent from the islands but very little.</p>
                        <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0468"/>
                        <p>I have carefully observed seal life, the condition of the rookeries, and
                            the method of taking seals at all seasons and under all conditions, with
                            the object of keeping the Russian Government thoroughly informed as to
                            its sealing interests, and the proper management of same.</p>
                        <p>While I have never had an opportunity to examine the Pribilof Islands
                            seals, yet I do not hesitate to express the opinion that that herd and
                            the Commander Islands herd are distinct and do not mingle at all. There
                            are some natives on the islands who are familiar with both, and who
                            state that there is a marked difference in the animals. Besides, my
                            studies as a naturalist enable me to state that it would be contrary to
                            all reason to suppose that they mingle with one another. The Commander
                            herd probably approaches very closely to the Robben herd in winter, and
                            yet it does not mingle with it. Of this I am sure, for I have charge of
                            Robben Island as well as of the Commander Islands, and know the skins of
                            the two herds to be different. The skin of the Commander seal is
                            thicker, has <hi rend="italic">coarser</hi> hair, is of a lighter color,
                            and weighs about 20 per cent more than a Robben skin of the same size.
                            It is wholly improbable that the seals of the Commander herd visit any
                            land other than the Commander Islands. I believe they regard these as
                            their home, these islands being peculiarly adapted to their needs at the
                            period of bringing forth their young, and of breeding.</p>
                        <p>The fact that the Robben Island herd still frequents Robben Island, to
                            the exclusion of any other land, notwithstanding it has been subjected
                            there to the utmost persecution, shows to my mind conclusively that the
                            presence of man will not prevent a seal herd from returning to the same
                            land year after year. Even if isolated instances have occurred (I know
                            of none) in which, for various causes, a few of the Commander Island
                            seals reached other shores, such exceptions would not disprove the
                            general rule above stated.</p>
                        <p>I can readily understand that a female which had been wounded in the
                            water might be obliged to seek the nearest land and there give birth to
                            her pup. Annually at almost stated periods they arrive at the islands,
                            and immediately proceed to occupy the same grounds which have been
                            occupied during past years, in a way which makes it impossible to doubt
                            that they are familiar with the locality. I believe that at some time
                            during the year every seal comes ashore.</p>
                        <p>There is no reason to believe that a certain number of any class remain
                            swimming about in the neighborhood of the islands all summer without
                            landing, although there is considerabe difference in the time at which
                            different classes arrive.</p>
                        <p>Soon after landing at the Commander Islands those cows which were
                            fertilized the year previous give birth to their young. A cow does not,
                            except in very rare instances, give birth to more than one pup in a
                            season. The birth of pups can only take place on shore. Cows never
                            arrive at the islands with new-born pups. But the impossibility of birth
                            in the water is best proved by the fact that the pup when first born is
                            purely a land animal in all its habits. It does not voluntarily approach
                            the water till it is several weeks old, and then it is obliged to learn
                            to swim.</p>
                        <p>A surf will sometimes wash the young pups off the rocks, when they are
                            sure to be drowned. The pups can not swim at birth, but must be taught
                            by their mothers. A pup would drown if thrown into the sea before
                            learning to swim. Copulation in the water I believe to be <pb n="443"
                                xml:id="pg_443" facs="0469"/>impossible, for the act is violent, of
                            long duration, and in general character similar to that performed by
                            land animals. I believe that the seals leave the vicinity of the islands
                            mainly on account of the severity of the winter.</p>
                        <p>Of course I do not mean to say that they would remain on shore all the
                            year round, as many of them do throughout most of the summer, for they
                            would be obliged to take to the water to obtain food. What I mean is
                            that they would not go so far away as they now do, but would remain
                            around the islands, and thus give additional proof of the unquestionable
                            fact that they regard them as their home. I base this statement upon the
                            fact that during mild winters I have myself seen them in large numbers
                            off the Commander Islands and the Kamchatka coast. This would be in
                            accord with the habits of the seals of the Southern Hemisphere, which, I
                            am informed, are found in the same locality more or less at all
                            seasons.</p>
                        <p>The seals generally leave the Commander Islands by the middle of
                            November, by which time it has become cold and stormy; but in mild
                            winters they have been on the islands as late as December. I do not
                            think that fur seals should be classed with wild animals any more than
                            sheep or cattle, when out on large pasturing grounds. Seals, unless
                            needlessly frightened, become more or less accustomed to the sight of
                            man among them on the rookeries, and while on land are at all times
                            under his complete control. A few men can drive a large number of them
                            without difficulty. They are intelligent to very high degree, and can be
                            made to become in a short time pets.</p>
                        <p>The breeding males or bulls are alone aggressive. Seals are polygamous,
                            and the powers of fertilization of the male are very great.</p>
                        <p>Since the births are about equally distributed between males and females,
                            it follows that under natural conditions there would be a great excess
                            of male life over that actually needed for the propagation of the
                            species; and it is, as in the case of so many other animals, for the
                            positive benefit of the herd as a whole that a portion of this excess of
                            male life be killed off before it is of sufficient age to go on the
                            rookeries. If not killed off the competition by the bulls upon the
                            rookeries for females would be destructive of much life. This
                            competition is already fierce enough.</p>
                        <p>During some of the years prior to the time of my arrival on the islands
                            there had been considerable indiscriminate killing of seals, without
                            regard to age or sex. But during the fifteen years of my management of
                            the Commander Islands rookeries all seals which have been killed
                            constituted a portion of the excess of males above referred to, and
                            known as “bachelors” or “hollus-chiechie.” This is why the rookeries are
                            to-day in a much better condition than when I first went to the
                            Commander Islands, notwithstanding that until the year 1891 a gradually
                            increasing number of large skins had been taken.</p>
                        <p>From 1886 to 1890 the average annual catch was about 50,000, the skins
                            all being large ones. The last two years I have reduced the catches,
                            because I now think 50,000 skins somewhat in excess of what the
                            rookeries can yield, and for other causes which I will mention later. I
                            feel very sure that the great cause of this diminution is pelagic
                            sealing. This year I have counted over 3,500 skins seized in poaching
                            vessels, and have found 96 per cent to be skins of females. These were
                            skins taken from Commander Island seals.</p>
                        <p>As to skins taken near the Pribilof Islands, I counted the skins <pb
                                n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0470"/>seized in the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Rosa Olsen</hi> and found two-thirds of them were skins of females.
                            These were taken, as the log book of the <hi rend="italic">Rosa
                                Olsen</hi> shows, over 80 miles from shore. I consider it a false
                            argument to say that the killing of a proper number of the excess of
                            male life is bad, merely because it is an interference with the order of
                            nature.</p>
                        <p>If not interfered with, nature will produce an overpopulation of the
                            rookeries, which would of course be a bad thing. By the present mode of
                            killing a certain number of young males, population is regulated. No
                            facts can be brought forward to show that this method is not the right
                            one. Past experience shows that it is right. The method is not proved to
                            be bad by showing that during some years too many males may have been
                            killed and the rookeries have thereby suffered. When such mistakes have
                            been made they can be corrected by reducing the number of males to be
                            killed for a few years, for the most absolute control can be exercised
                            over the herd while it is on land.</p>
                        <p>I claim that the method now pursued, when executed under proper
                            regulation, is in theory and in practice the only one by which sealing
                            can be carried on commercially without injuring the vitality of the herd
                            and its ability to maintain its numbers at the proper limit. It does not
                            cause the seals to change their habits in any way, and I do not believe
                            that even an excessive killing would have the effect of altering the
                            habits of the female seals with regard to landing and cause them to
                            remain about the islands instead of coming ashore.</p>
                        <p>Cows, except perhaps rare cases of accident or for scientific purposes,
                            are never allowed to be killed on the islands, and the reason for this
                            is that all cows are needed for breeding purposes. To kill, therefore,
                            any cow except a barren one (and there are few barren ones except among
                            the very old cows) inflicts a much greater injury on the herd than the
                            loss of a single life.</p>
                        <p>It is not true that because it is proper to kill a certain number of
                            males, it is also proper to kill a certain number of females. But,
                            assuming that it might at some time become desirable to kill some
                            females, it would still be wholly improper to kill them without regard
                            to size or condition, as is the case when they are killed in the
                            water.</p>
                        <p>There is at the present time upon the Commander Islands an abundance of
                            female life for breeding purposes, and there is no fear that any female
                            will not be served through a lack of virile males. On the other hand, it
                            is undoubtedly true that there were in 1892 relatively fewer females
                            than in former years, and I attribute this to two causes: First, to
                            killing of seals in the water; and second, to raids upon the
                            islands.</p>
                        <p>The first of these causes is by far the most important. These raids upon
                            the islands have, owing to the great amount of foggy weather, taken
                            place to a certain extent, notwithstanding the greatest precautions to
                            guard against them. The raiders kill males, females, and pups without
                            discrimination. But however injuriously the raids have affected the
                            rookeries, still they are of much less importance than the killing of
                            Commander Island seals in the water.</p>
                        <p>During the past two summers, and especially during the last one, this
                            killing in the water has become so great that if allowed to continue in
                            future years the herd will be in danger of ultimate extinction. I do
                            riot know exactly how wasteful this method may be, from the fact that
                            all the animals wounded or killed are not captured, though I am told <pb
                                n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0471"/>that much loss occurs in that
                            way, and I know that under certain conditions a seal shot dead will sink
                            at once. I can state positively, however, from actual experience and
                            personal examination, that a vast proportion—fully 96 per cent—of the
                            skins taken by this method during the present year are those of female
                            animals. In addition a certain number of the skins are those of very
                            young seals, probably of both sexes, such as are never killed on
                            land.</p>
                        <p>Very few of the females killed are barren, no matter when or where they
                            are killed. Females taken early in the season are generally heavy with
                            young, in which condition they travel slowly as compared with the other
                            seals. The killing of such a female involves, of course, the immediate
                            loss of two lives. But even when the female is taken after she has been
                            on shore and given birth to her young, this same result follows
                            eventually. For a seat will suckle only her own pup, and the pups are
                            for the first three to five months dependent altogether on their mothers
                            for food. Consequently when the mothers, who after the birth of their
                            pups leave the rookeries in search of food (traveling sometimes
                            considerable distances, I do not know exactly how far), fail to return
                            their pups must necessarily die.</p>
                        <p>There are always a few dead pups to be found on the rookeries whose death
                            is not due to that of their mothers; but during the last year or two a
                            greater number of dead pups have been actually noticed than heretofore
                            and have attracted the attention of all persons on the islands who are
                            at all familiar with seal life. It can not be successfully contended
                            that they all died of natural causes. There is no disease among the
                            Commander Island seals, and while a certain number of young pups are
                            always exposed to the danger of being crushed to death (but not as a
                            result of the drives which are made to collect the seals for killing) or
                            of being drowned by the surf, yet these causes of death will not account
                            for the greater mortality of pups which took place during the past
                            summer. Besides, the bodies of the dead pups I refer to are those of
                            starved animals, being greatly emaciated.</p>
                        <p>It is chiefly during the next few years that the effects of the recent
                            killing of females will become most noticeable, because many of the pups
                            which in those years would have become bachelors or “holluschiekie” have
                            never been born, or died soon after birth.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the driving of the seals from the beaches to the places of
                            slaughter, while it does not benefit them, yet I believe that there are
                            very few cases in which it does them any harm, even if they are
                            redriven. I am sure it does not render them impotent. It should be
                            remembered that, unlike the hair seal, they are fairly well adapted to
                            movements on land, as is proved by the fact that they are in some cases
                            actually driven considerable distances over ground that is both rough
                            and steep. Since the killing of seals in the water is wasteful and in
                            every sense contrary to the laws of nature (which require that special
                            protection be afforded to the females and young of all animals), I am of
                            the opinion that it should be entirely forbidden.</p>
                        <p>If it is only partly suppressed or prohibited within a certain distance
                            from the islands the evil would not be cured, although its effects might
                            be less noticeable, for the killing of females, many of them heavy with
                            young, would necessarily continue, since all experience shows that
                            female animals always constitute the chief catch of the open-sea
                            seals.</p>

                        <p>The seals of the Commander Islands differ noticeably in their habits and
                            the condition of their food from those of the Pribilof Islands (because
                            of the difference in the waters surrounding the islands).</p>
                        <p>The seals of the Commander herds need not, and do not, go any
                            comparatively great distance from the coast in search of food, as do the
                            seals of the Pribilof herds. This observation, formerly made by Mr.
                            Grebnitsky, has been fully confirmed by later researches, and finally by
                            the recent investigations of American and English scientists, who have
                            also certified to the fact that seals can not feed except in great
                            depths.</p>
                        <p>One of the principal points attested to on the basis of investigated
                            facts is that the seal not only seeks its food in the very profound
                            depths, but it feeds upon cephalopodes and swimming fish near the
                            surface of the water. In Bering Sea their principal food in the months
                            of August and September consists of the “gadus chalcogrammus” (Teregra),
                            then the “gonatus amœnus” of the cephalopode class, salmon, and some
                            sorts of little fish. Outside the Bering Sea the food is different; the
                            gadus chaleogrammus does not go far to the south (on the American
                            coast), but salmonides, herrings, chiridse are to be found instead. On
                            the Pribilof Islands one sees but little excrement, quite the contrary
                            from what one sees on the seal dwelling places on Commander Islands,
                            according to the very just statement of the American naturalist, Mr.
                            Frederick A. Lucas (curator of the department of comparative anatomy of
                            the United States National Museum).</p>
                        <p>The recent researches are by Fred. Lucas; Robert Snodgras; Pierre A.
                            Fisch, of New York; Ch. Wardell Stiles; C. H. Townsend; W. Hour Wilson
                            Thoburn, professor of the Stanford University, and member of the
                            Biological Society of Washington; Chart Merria; Clark; A. B. Alexander;
                            Dr. J. A. Allen.</p>
                        <p>Everybody remembers also David Star Jordan, Barret-Hamilton, Dr. Arcy
                            Thompson Elliot, Charles Henry Gilbert Steineger. It depends directly on
                            this fact that the feeding grounds of the seals of the Commander Islands
                            are near the islands, and the seals return to the coast before the food
                            taken has time to pass through the intestines and be evacuated. Young
                            seals are nourished exclusively by their mother’s milk until their
                            departure from the islands at the close of November.</p>
                        <p>The investigations concerning the sort of food eaten by seals show that
                            they are choice enough in their food; and that, for instance, they do
                            not eat codfish (gadus morrhua), which is found in great abundance and
                            very near the coast; that the seal takes a great deal of food at one
                            time, is really voracious, which explains the necessity of the
                            excursions in search of food.</p>
                        <p>The observations demonstrate that female seals eat more and need food
                            oftener than the males. Under these circumstances the depths of 200
                            meters (100 Russian sagenes) are of great importance to seals, because
                            in these depths and near them, the greater part of the seal’s food is
                            found—the cephalopodes gonatus and a quantity of fish of medium
                            level.</p>
                        <p>Most of the pelagic sealing is done just near these limits, and the
                            farther away these depths are from the dwelling places of the seals,
                            during the period of propagation and nursing, so much farther must the
                            animals go out to sea to seek their food.</p>
                        <p>For the Pribilof Islands that limit is at a distance of 75 to 150 miles;
                            for the Commander, where the depths are quite near the coast, the seals
                            have not far to go for their food (p. 16). As tor the food of seals at
                            the time of migration along the coast, we have at present but little
                            definite data.</p>

                        <p>At the present time the conditions of life on the shore have entirely
                            changed, on account of the unfortunate effect of pelagic sealing. Among
                            all the works published by those organized commissions of scientists, on
                            the part of the United States and England, Volume IV, treating of the
                            Asiatic seals, is in some respects the most original, and of greater
                            value than the other reports of the commissions. With regard to the
                            Commander Islands, the value of that work is especially due to the
                            circumstance that the author, the learned naturalist Steineger, resided
                            upon the islands at the time of the greatest prosperity of the shore
                            herds (the summer colonies), and he was able to compare the then state
                            of things with that of his two visits in the years 1895–1897. In
                            concluding, he pronounced most authoritatively upon the ravages wrought
                            to the sealing grounds and to all reasonable sealing by free pelagic
                            hunting—and solely by that, not by any other cause whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>“I have been unable to resist the force of the logic which places the
                            blame for the decrease of the Commander Islands’ seals upon pelagic
                            sealing, and upon pelagic sealing alone.”</p>
                        <p rend="center">[Page 12.]</p>
                        <p>It is well known that marine hunting near the Commander Islands was not
                            so common until the year 1892, although attempted much earlier than that
                            year. On account of the agreement on the modus vivendi concluded between
                            the United States and England, all the operations of sealing schooners
                            was transferred to the Asiatic herds. Russia profited from the year
                            1893, according to the terms of the agreement signed with England, by a
                            zone of 30 miles around the Commander Islands. The purpose was the
                            timely prevention of the raids by schooners and of their commanders upon
                            the seashore, and thereby to insure the safety of seals and particularly
                            of females, always specially predominant among the pelagic catches.</p>
                        <p>The work of the Canadian. Japanese, and American schooners which sealed
                            in the neighboring waters of the Commander Islands, and in all the other
                            parts of the sea, is set forth in the following figures: <list>
                                <item>In 1895, 162 schooners operated, and took 92,437 seals.</item>
                                <item>In 1896 there were 94 schooners, which took 69,536
                                    seals.</item>
                                <item>In 1897 there were 71 schooners, which took 39,511
                                    seals.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>These schooners were from 20 to 150 tons tonnage; medium size, 69 to 70
                            tons. Schooners of less than 20 tons were not employed for sealing
                            purposes except near Washington Territory and British Columbia; the
                            owners and crew of these small schooners were natives. But the majority
                            of these schooners came from Victoria, British Columbia; their crews
                            were picked up among the native Indians, sealing in boats. The greatest
                            number of boats attached to schooners is 18 for the large ones; the
                            least number 8 for small schooners. If the crew consists of Europeans,
                            the number of fishing boats is 6 to 10, and not more than 12. Three men
                            were employed in each boat, while 2 men were employed in each canoe.</p>
                        <p>The number of Canadian schooners was always greater than the American.
                            Thus, in the year 1897 there were 41 Canadian schooners, having a total
                            of 2,708 tons, and 17 American schooners at a tonnage of 898.</p>
                        <p>In the winter months the schooners do their sealing along the American
                            coast. In the spring they are already near the coast of Japan. In the
                            month of June the schooners pass into Bering Sea, and, finally, toward
                            September, after having finished sealing, the schooners return to
                            British Columbia. From 1889 to 1898 there were 35 schooners damaged, of
                            which 13 sank with all their crews, and but very few vessels that did
                            not lose some men and boats.</p>

                                differently translated, because by that expression is meant those
                                parts or places of sea which are frequented by the seals leaving the
                                coast in search of food during the time of their sojourn on the

                            to the extent of a marine league, unless a different rule is fixed by

                        of the Netherlands, exercising the functions of arbitrator, which he has had
                        the honor to have conferred upon him by the Government of the United States
                        of America, and the Imperial Government of Russia, to decide as to the
                        differences relating to the affair of the bark <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                            Pigeon:</hi></p>
                    <p>Whereas by virtue of the declarations exchanged at St. Petersburg the 26th
                        August (September 8) 1900, between the aforesaid two Governments, the
                        arbitrator shall take cognizance of the claims for indemnity for the seizure
                        and detention of certain American vessels by Russian cruisers, brought
                        against the Imperial Russian Government by the Government of the United
                        States in the name of the parties in interest;</p>
                    <p>That according to these declarations the arbitrator, following in his award
                        the general principles of international law and the spirit of international
                        agreements applicable to the subject, shall determine with regard to each
                        claim filed against the Imperial Russian Government, whether it is well
                        founded, and if so, whether the facts upon which it is based are proved;</p>
                    <p>That, furthermore, it is recognized that this stipulation shall have no
                        retroactive force, and that the arbitrator will apply to the cases in
                        litigation the principles of international law and the international
                        treaties which were in force and binding upon the parties engaged in this
                        litigation at the time the seizure of the vessels took place;</p>
                    <p>Finally, that the arbitrator shall fix the amount of the indemnity which may
                        be due from the Russian Government on account of the claims presented by the
                        parties in interest;</p>
                    <p>Whereas, after a minute examination of the memoranda and counter memoranda
                        exchanged between the high-contracting parties, as well as of all the
                        exhibits of each side, the arbitrator, availing himself of the right
                        accorded him by the said declarations of St. Petersburg, invited the two
                        Governments to name commercial experts to aid him in fixing the amount of
                        the indemnity which would eventually be due, and in addressing himself to
                        that effect to the two high-contracting parties the arbitrator at the same
                        time prayed them to furnish supplementary information regarding the points
                        of law, indicated by him;</p>
                    <p>Whereas, in the sittings held by the arbitrator at The Hague in the hall of
                        Permanent Court of Arbitration, from the 27th June to the 4th July, 1902, he
                        heard the depositions of experts in the presence of the agents of the two
                        high-contracting parties, who on that occasion furnished the supplementary
                        information asked for by the arbitrator;</p>

                    <p>Whereas, in support of the claim relative to the seizure and detention of the
                        American whaler <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> by an armed cruiser
                        of the Imperial Russian Government, the party claimant alleged the following
                        facts:</p>
                    <p>The bark <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi>, constructed for whaling,
                        having set sail from San Francisco on the 7th December, 1891, with a crew of
                        thirty men besides the captain (named Scullun or Scullan) for a voyage in
                        the seas of Japan and Okhotsk was, on the 10th September, 1892, in the Sea
                        of Othotsk, on the high seas, engaged in whaling, when it was seized and
                        detained by the commander of a vessel of the Russian navy (cruiser) and
                        conducted to Vladivostok, where it was detained by the Russian authorities
                        until the 1st October, 1892. After the seizure of the bark, her crew was
                        placed aboard the Russian schooner <hi rend="italic">Maria</hi> (which
                        according to the declaration of the defendant party had been seized by the
                        Russian cruiser for illegal sealing), and was forced to conduct her into the
                        port of Vladivostok. In that town, after they had been told that they would
                        be lodged in the guard house, this shelter from cold and hunger was refused
                        them, and the captain found himself obliged to secure lodgings for them in a
                        shed. They were detained from day to day without being told the reason, and
                        finally, on the 1st October, 1892, they were sent back to their vessel.</p>
                    <p>Whereas the defendant party recognizes that in this case a regretable error
                        occurred, since the naval officer (Lieutenant Von Cube) was mistaken in
                        suspecting the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> of being engaged in
                        illegitimate hunting, and consequently the Imperial Government, recognizing
                        its responsibility, offered to pay a pecuniary indemnity for the actual
                        losses caused to the aliens by the acts of its governmental agents;</p>
                    <p>Whereas the task of the arbitrator in this affair consists in fixing the
                        amount of indemnity to be paid by the defendant party;</p>
                    <p>Whereas the claim of the party claimant amounts to a total of $80,700, with
                        interest at 6 per cent per annum from the 10th of September, 1892, and that
                        the defendant party has offered to pay $2,500 also with interest at 6 per
                        cent per annum;</p>
                    <p>Whereas the defendant party thinks that the first item of the claim amounting
                        to $3,040 for the expenses of the owner of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                            Pigeon</hi> on account of the seizure should be reduced to $1,010, and
                        in fact, the amount claimed not being sufficiently justified, it might be
                        reduced in conformity with the conclusions of the defendant party;</p>
                    <p>Whereas, for the services of the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                            Pigeon</hi> for conducting the Russian schooner to Vladivotsok, the sum
                        of $1,000, offered by the defendant party in lieu of the sum of $1,200
                        claimed by the party claimant, seems sufficient;</p>
                    <p>Whereas the defendant party admits as justified the claims for provisions
                        consumed, $200; for lodgings for the crew, $210; for personal expenses of
                        Captain Scullun, $50; total, $460;</p>
                    <p>Whereas the party claimant claims $45,000 for loss of the catch during the
                        time which transpired between the seizure of the whaler and the day on which
                        he was able to resume whaling; and the defendant party contests the
                        underlying principle of that part of the claim, alleging that it is question
                        of the profit of an enterprise liable to risks and which may readily
                        terminate in loss, and applying in support of the assertion the award of the
                        court of arbitration of 1872 in the case of the “Alabama claims,” by which
                        the claims for indemnity for indirect damages were set aside;</p>
                    <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0479"/>
                    <p>Considering that the general principle of civil law, according to which the
                        damages should include an indemnity, not only for the loss suffered, but
                        also for the profit of which one has been deprived, is equally applicable to
                        international litigation, and that in order to apply it, it is not necessary
                        that the amount of the profit of which one is deprived should be exactly
                        determined, but that it suffices to show that in the natural order of things
                        one would be able to realize a profit of which one is deprived by the act
                        which gives rise to the claim;</p>
                    <p>Considering that in this case it is not a question of indirect damage, but of
                        direct damage, the amount of which should be estimated;</p>
                    <p>Considering the amount of that part of the claim which the party claimant
                        takes for starting point, the average number of whales taken in one season,
                        which he estimates at 8, and from which he deducts 2, which Captain Scullun
                        had already taken, leaving 6 as probable number of whales still to be caught
                        by him, if the vessel had not been arrested and seized;</p>
                    <p>Considering, however, that according to Captain Scullun’s own declaration he
                        had taken 28 whales in four seasons, which make 7 per season, and whereas 7
                        indicate more justly the average catch for the whaler <hi rend="italic">Cape
                            Horn Pigeon</hi> during one season, which, after deducting the 2 whales
                        already caught, gives 5 for the remaining probable catch;</p>
                    <p>Considering that with regard to the approximate value of a whale at the
                        period when the product of the catch of the <hi rend="italic">Cape Horn
                            Pigeon</hi> in 1892 could have been sold, the result of the inquiry
                        which took place in this arbitration, and the information furnished to the
                        arbitrator, show that the average weight of the bone to be obtained from 1
                        whale may be estimated at 1,200 pounds and the average price at $4 per
                        pound, the average quantity of oil at 100 barrels and the average price at
                        $12 per barrel, which makes a total of $6,000 per whale and $30,000 for 5
                        whales, or after the deduction of $1,500, instead of $1,800 deducted by
                        Captain Scullun, $28,500;</p>
                    <p>Considering, with regard to the indemnity claimed for the members of the crew
                        at $1,000 per man to be $31,000, that it is not proved that the members of
                        the crew were subjected to the bad treatment of which they complain, but
                        that, on the other hand, the very fact that they were detained against their
                        will at Vladivostok for about three weeks in consequence of the illegal
                        seizure of their vessel, entitles them to indemnity independently of that
                        which is due them for having been forced to conduct a-Russian vessel to
                        Vladivostok, and the amount of this indemnity should be fixed at $7,750, or
                        an average of $250 per capita;</p>
                    <p>That, consequently, the total of damage due from the defendant party to the
                        party claimant as a result of the detention and seizure of the <hi
                            rend="italic">Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> amounts to the sum of $38,750;</p>
                    <p>Considering that the defendant party recognized as perfectly regular the
                        addition of interest at 6 per cent per annum;</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the arbitrator decides and pronounces the following:</p>
                    <p>The defendant party shall pay to the party claimant on account of the claims
                        presented by the parties in interest in the case of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Cape Horn Pigeon</hi> the sum of $38,750 in United States money, with
                        interest on that sum at 6 per cent per annum from the 9th of September,
                        1892, until the day of the payment in full.</p>

                    <head>CASE OF THE “JAMES HAMILTON LEWIS.”</head>
                    <p>The undersigned, Tobie Michel Charles Asser, member of the council of state
                        of the Netherlands, exercising the functions of arbitrator, which he has had
                        the honor to have conferred upon him by the Government of the United States
                        and the Imperial Government of Russia, to decide as to the differences
                        relating to the affair of the schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                            Lewis;</hi></p>
                    <p>Whereas, by virtue of the declarations exchanged at St. Petersburg the 26th
                        August (September 8), 1900, between the aforesaid two Governments, the
                        arbitrator shall take cognizance of the claims for indemnity for the seizure
                        and detention of certain American vessels by Russian cruisers, brought
                        against the Imperial Russian Government by the Government of the United
                        States of America, in the name of the parties in interest;</p>
                    <p>That according to those declarations the arbitrator, being governed in his
                        award by the general principles of international law and the spirit of
                        international agreements applicable to the subject, shall determine with
                        regard to each claim filed against the Imperial Russian Government whether
                        it is well founded, and if so, whether the facts upon which it is based are
                        proved;</p>
                    <p>That furthermore it is recognized that this stipulation shall have no
                        retroactive force, and that the arbitrator will apply to the cases in
                        litigation the principles of international law and the international
                        treaties which were in force and binding upon the parties engaged in this
                        litigation at the time the seizure of the vessels took place;</p>
                    <p>Finally, that the arbitrator shall fix the amount of the indemnity which may
                        be due from the Russian Government on account of the claims presented by the
                        parties in interest;</p>
                    <p>Whereas, after a minute examination of the memoranda and counter memoranda
                        exchanged between the high contracting parties, as well as of all the
                        exhibits of each side, the arbitrator, availing himself of the right
                        accorded him by the said declarations of St. Petersburg, invited the two
                        Governments to name commercial experts to aid him in fixing the amount of
                        indemnity which may eventually be due, and in addressing himself to that
                        effect to the two high contracting parties, the arbitrator at the same time
                        requested them to furnish supplementary information regarding the points of
                        law indicated by him;</p>
                    <p>Whereas, in the sittings held by the arbitrator at The Hague, in the hall of
                        the permanent court of arbitration, from the 27th June to the 4th July,
                        1902, he heard the depositions of experts in the presence of the agents of
                        the two high contracting parties, who on that occasion furnished the
                        supplementary information asked for by the arbitrator;</p>
                    <p>Whereas, in support of the claim relative to the seizure and confiscation of
                        the schooner <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, the party claimant
                        alleged the following facts:</p>
                    <p>The said schooner having set sail from San Francisco on the 7th <pb n="455"
                            xml:id="pg_455" facs="0481"/>May, 1891, bound on a voyage in the North
                        Pacific Ocean on a fishing and hunting expedition, with Alexander McLean as
                        captain, was, on the 2d August, 1891, about 20 miles east of Copper Island
                        (latitude 55° 35′ north, longitude 167° 21′ east), when she was seized early
                        in the morning by the Russian cruiser <hi rend="italic">Aleoute</hi>. The
                        captain of the schooner thinking it necessary to make land for the purpose
                        of verifying his chronometer, directed his course toward Copper Island. At
                        that place his vessel was compelled to lay to by a cannon shot from said
                        cruiser, and a longboat approaching the schooner, a Russian naval officer
                        ascended from the boat to the deck of the schooner and demanded the official
                        log book, which was given him by the captain, and which he took with “him,
                        returning to his vessel. Presently he returned with several armed men and
                        ordered Captain McLean to leave his vessel and to come as a prisoner on
                        board the <hi rend="italic">Aleout</hi> with all of his crew, except seven
                        men. Captain McLean refused to obey this order, and resumed his eastward
                        course; then the commander of the cruiser began a pursuit, and, circling the
                            <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, captured her by force of
                        arms; the captain and members of the crew were conducted to Vladivostok; the
                        vessel, with her cargo, her equipment, and the personal property of the
                        captain, was confiscated; her captain, his officers, and crew were detained
                        prisoners, and subjected to harsh and unjust treatment, and on being
                        released, were left to find their way home as best they could;</p>
                    <p>Whereas the damage claimed by the party claimant on account of the parties in
                        interest, for the seizure and confiscation of the vessel and the
                        imprisonment of the captain and crew, reaches a total of $101,336 with
                        interest at 6 per cent per annum;</p>
                    <p>Whereas the party defendant, replying to the allegations of the party
                        claimant, maintains that when the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                            Lewis</hi> was sighted by the cruiser she was only 5 miles at most from
                        Medny Island (or Copper Island) and that the seizure took place at a
                        distance of 12 (or 11) miles from the coast; that furthermore it is shown
                        from a series of facts set forth by the defendant party that the <hi
                            rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> must be presumed to have been
                        guilty of illegal sealing in Russian territorial waters; that consequently
                        the agents of the Imperial Government were justified in pursuing her even
                        outside of such waters and in seizing and confiscating her with her cargo;
                        that the imprisonment of the crew was caused by their resistance to arrest
                        and the seizure of the vessel;</p>
                    <p>Whereas the defendant party, relying upon these allegations and subsidiarily
                        contesting the amount of the demand, has requested that the claims of the
                        party claimant be rejected;</p>
                    <p>Whereas the honorable delegate of the party claimant, Mr. Herbert H. D.
                        Peirce, in the sitting of July 4, 1902, in the name of the Government of the
                        United States of America made the following declaration: <quote

                                    between the united states and russia, in reply to the question
                                    asked by the arbitrator relative to the extent of jurisdiction
                                    claimed by the united states over the bordering waters of the
                                    bering sea.</hi></p>
                            <p>The delegate of the United States makes this declaration under the
                                specific authority received by him from the Secretary of State of
                                the United States on July 3, 1902, to wit:</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States claims neither in Bering Sea nor
                                in its other <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0482"/>bordering
                                waters an extent of jurisdiction greater than a maritime league from
                                its shores, but bases its claims to such jurisdiction on the
                                following principle:</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States claims and admits the
                                jurisdiction of any State over its jurisdictional waters only to the
                                extent of a maritime league, unless a different rule is fixed by
                                treaty between two States; even then the treaty States are alone
                                affected by the agreement.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Considering that the arbitrator must decide:</p>
                    <p>I. Whether the seizure and confiscation of the schooner <hi rend="italic"
                            >James Hamilton Lewis</hi> and her cargo, as well as the imprisonment of
                        the crew, should be considered as illegal acts.</p>
                    <p>II. If in the affirmative, what amount of indemnity is due from the defendant
                        party.</p>
                    <p>I. (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Considering this question must be decided
                        according to the general principles of international law and the spirit of
                        international agreements in force and binding upon the two high parties at
                        the time of the seizure of the vessel;</p>
                    <p>That at the time no agreement existed between the two parties containing in
                        the special matter of sealing any derogation of the general principles of
                        international law with regard to the extent of territorial waters;</p>
                    <p>That the defendant party sets forth that in the litigation between the United
                        States of America and Great Britain before the Tribunal of Arbitration
                        established by virtue of the treaty concluded at Washington the 29th
                        February, 1892, the United States Government set up with regard to the right
                        of jurisdiction in Bering Sea, against Great Britain, claims to an extent of
                        far greater limits than those which are admitted by the general principles
                        of international law, that these claims were prompted by the interest in the
                        preservation of the seals and the suppression of illegal sealing, and that
                        while the Government of the United States of America loyally submitted to
                        the decision of the arbitrary court of 1893, which did not adopt its view,
                        that view may nevertheless be employed to combat the claim filed by this
                        Government in the present litigation;</p>
                    <p>Considering that whatever may be the desirability of the policy in in
                        question as basis of an agreement between the States interested, it could
                        not be obligatory without such an understanding even in the case of a
                        government which at another time had pleaded it, but unsuccessfully, before
                        a tribunal of arbitration;</p>
                    <p>Considering that the agreement which was entered into between the parties
                        after the seizure and confiscation of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton
                            Lewis</hi> could not modify the effect of the principles of law
                        generally accepted at the time of these acts;</p>
                    <p>Considering that the seizure of the schooner took place according to the
                        party claimant at a distance of about 20, and according to the defendant
                        party at a distance of 11 or 12, miles from Russian territory, and that even
                        if the latter version be the true one, the act was accomplished outside
                        Russian territorial waters, which is, moreover, admitted by both
                        parties;</p>
                    <p>Considering that the policy of the defendant party according to which it was
                        permitted to a war ship of a State to pursue beyond territorial waters a
                        vessel whose crew had rendered themselves guilty of an illegal act in
                        territorial waters or on the territory of that State could not be regarded
                        as conforming to international law, since the jurisdiction of a State does
                        not extend beyond the limits of the territorial sea, unless this rule has
                        been derogated by a special convention;</p>
                    <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0483"/>
                    <p>Considering that it is not necessary to examine whether the presumptions
                        alleged by the defendant party are serious enough to cause the admission
                        that the crew of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> had been
                        guilty of sealing in territorial waters or on Russian territory;</p>
                    <p>Considering that the seizure and confiscation of the <hi rend="italic">James
                            Hamilton Lewis</hi> and her cargo, as well as the imprisonment of her
                        crew, should in consequence be regarded as illegal acts, there remains but
                        to fix the amount of indemnity due from the defendant party in this
                        respect.</p>
                    <p>II. (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Considering that the party claimant claims, in
                        the first place, $25,000 for the confiscation of the vessel, but that that
                        claim is exaggerated; that basing its claim on the figures to be found in
                        the American publications sent to the arbitrator by the party claimant
                        (Report of fur-seal investigations, 1899, Part III, p. 228), and more
                        particularly on the value specified of the vessels having about the same or
                        greater tonnage than the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi>, and
                        noting on the one hand that the schooner was in excellent condition, and on
                        the other hand the fact that having gone to sea on the 7th March, 1891,
                        nearly five months of her provisions had been consumed at the time of the
                        seizure (August 2, 1892), there could not be attributed to this vessel, with
                        her boats and equipment and her provisions, a value exceeding the sum of
                        $9,000;</p>
                    <p>Considering that the party claimant claims for the 421 seal skins confiscated
                        with the vessel $14 per skin, being a total of $5,936, but that upon minute
                        examination of the several documents produced, as well as the depositions of
                        experts, it appears that the price per skin would not exceed $12, which
                        makes a total of $5,088 for the 424 skins;</p>
                    <p>Considering that the party claimant claims $36,400 for the loss of the
                        probable catch of 2,600 skins, at $14 per skin, but that, while admitting
                        that the principal loss of catch during the portion of the season still
                        remaining after the seizure of the vessel may be claimed as an item of the
                        damage, the number 2,600 skins is in no way justified, and seems
                        exaggerated; that from statistics produced in litigation, while noting the
                        number of seals already taken, and of the time which must elapse before the
                        close of the season, it may be admitted that the product of sealing would
                        not have exceeded 500 seals, which, at the rate of $12 per skin, gives a
                        total of $6,000;</p>
                    <p>Finally, considering that the party claimant claims for the benefit of the
                        crew of the <hi rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> for their
                        imprisonment, their sufferings, mental and physical, etc., $2,000 for each
                        of the 17 men, being $34,000; that the defendant party energetically denies
                        that the complaints made by the crew on the subject of acts of violence and
                        bad treatment to which they were subjected are founded, and that evidence in
                        support of these allegations has not been submitted; that, however, the very
                        fact of the illegal imprisonment give to the parties in interest a right to
                        claim an indemnity, the amount of which, according to an equitable estimate,
                        may be fixed at $8,500, or an average of $500 per person;</p>
                    <p>That consequently the total of indemnity due from the defendant party to the
                        party claimant on account of the seizure and confiscation of the <hi
                            rend="italic">James Hamilton Lewis</hi> amounts to the sum of
                        $28,588.</p>
                    <p>Considering that the defendant party consents to the adjunction of interest
                        at 6 per cent per annum to the sum to be paid; that as an <pb n="458"
                            xml:id="pg_458" facs="0484"/>indemnity is granted for the loss of catch
                        during the remainder of the season of 1891, it is just that the interest
                        should only begin to accrue from the 1st January, 1892;</p>
                    <p>Therefore the arbitrator decides and pronounces the following:</p>
                    <p>The defendant party will pay to the party claimant on account of the claims
                        presented by the parties in interest in the case of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >James Hamilton Lewis</hi> the sum of $28,588 in United States money,
                        with interest on that sum at 6 per cent per annum from the 1st January,
                        1892, until the day of full payment.</p>

                    <head>AFFAIR OF THE “C. H. WHITE.”</head>
                    <p>The undersigned, Tobie Michel Charles Asser, member of the council of state
                        of the Netherlands, exercising the functions of arbitrator, which he has had
                        the honor to have conferred upon him by the Government of the United States
                        of America and the Imperial Government of Russia, to decide as to the
                        differences relating to the affair of the schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                            White;</hi></p>
                    <p>Whereas, by virtue of the declarations exchanged at St. Petersburg, August 26
                        (September 8), 1900, between the aforesaid two Governments, the arbitrator
                        must take cognizance of the claims for indemnity for the seizure and
                        detention of certain American vessels by Russian cruisers, brought against
                        the Imperial Russian Government by the Government of the United States of
                        America, in the name of the parties in interest;</p>
                    <p>That according to these declarations the arbitrator, following in his award
                        the general principles of international law and the spirit of international
                        agreements applicable to the subject, shall decide with regard to each claim
                        filed against the Imperial Russian Government whether it is well founded;
                        and if in the affirmative, whether the facts upon which it is based are
                        proved;</p>
                    <p>That furthermore it is recognized that this stipulation shall have no
                        retroactive force, and that the arbitrator shall apply to the cases in
                        litigation the principles of international law and of international treaties
                        which were in force and binding upon the parties engaged in this litigation
                        at the time the seizure of the vessels took place;</p>
                    <p>That finally the arbitrator shall fix the sum of the indemnity which may
                        eventually be due from the Russian Government on account of the claims
                        presented by the parties in interest;</p>
                    <p>Whereas, after a minute examination of the memoranda and counter memoranda
                        exchanged between the high contracting parties, as well as of all the
                        exhibits of each side, the arbitrator, availing himself of the right
                        accorded him by said declarations of St. Petersburg, invited the two
                        Governments to name commercial experts to aid him in fixing the amount of
                        indemnity which would eventually be due, and in addressing himself to that
                        effect to the high contracting parties the arbitrator at the same time
                        requested them to furnish supplementary information regarding the points of
                        law indicated by him;</p>
                    <p>Whereas, in the sittings held by the arbitrator at The Hague, in the hall of
                        Permanent Court of Arbitration, from the 27th June to the 4th July, 1902, he
                        heard the depositions of experts in the presence of the agents of the two
                        high contracting parties, who on that occasion furnished the supplementary
                        information asked for by the arbitrator;</p>
                    <p>Whereas, in support of the claim relative to the seizure and confiscation of
                        the schooner <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, the party claimant alleged
                        the following facts:</p>
                    <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0486"/>
                    <p>The said schooner having set sail from San Francisco on May 7, 1892, on a
                        hunting and fishing expedition in the North Pacific Ocean or elsewhere, with
                        Lawrence M. Furman as captain, was, on the 12th July, 1892, about 40 miles
                        south of the Agatha Island, one of the Aleutian Islands, and about the same
                        day the captain set sail for the Kuriles Islands with the intention of
                        fishing some distance off the coast. The captain deviated from his course
                        toward the Kuriles Islands in the direction of Copper Island or Bering
                        Island, to regulate his chronometer. The 15th July, 1892, the vessel having
                        reached latitude 54° 18’ north and longitude 167° 19’ east (it is evidently
                        by mistake that in certain places in the memorandum of the party claimant
                        longitude 167° 19’ west is given) was overhauled by the Russian man-of-war
                            <hi rend="italic">Zabiaka</hi>, and the captain of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >C. H. White</hi> was ordered to come aboard the Russian cruiser with
                        all of his ship’s papers; the commander of the cruiser having examined his
                        papers, arrested the captain of the schooner and transferred him with all of
                        his crew, except the first mate, aboard the cruiser as prisoners; the
                        captain was put under surveillance. The schooner (with her cargo consisting
                        of 20 seal skins, 8 casks of mackerel, and ton of codfish) was seized and
                        towed as far as the bay of Nicolsky (Bering Island), whence it was taken to
                        Petropavlovsk; later it was confiscated and appropriated to the use of the
                        Imperial Russian Government. The captain and crew of the schooner were
                        transported as prisoners to Petropavlovsk, where they arrived on July 20,
                        1892. On the 8th August, of the same year, the crew was conducted aboard the
                        American ship <hi rend="italic">Majestic</hi> to be returned to their
                        country. The captain and members of the crew claimed to have suffered
                        greatly from ill treatment inflicted upon them during their imprisonment;
                        besides the captain, the first mate, Andrew Ronning, and the fisherman,
                        Neils Wolfgang, claimed to have lost personal belongings which were not
                        restored to them.</p>
                    <p>Whereas the damage claimed by the party claimant in the name of the parties
                        in interest, on the counts mentioned, amount to the sum of $150,720 with
                        interest at 6 per cent per annum;</p>
                    <p>Whereas the defendant party, replying to the allegations of the party
                        claimant, maintains that the seizure of the <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                            White</hi> took place not in 54° 18’ but in 54° 10’ latitude north, or
                        at a distance of only about 23 miles from the nearest Russian coast; that
                        moreover from a series of circumstances set forth by the defendant party
                        there resulted the presumption that the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>
                        might have been guilty of illegal sealing in Russian territorial waters;</p>
                    <p>That therefore the agents of the Imperial Government were justified in
                        pursuing the schooner even beyond those waters, and in seizing and
                        confiscating her with her cargo;</p>
                    <p>That the defendant party sets up against the complaint of the crew regarding
                        the ill treatment they were subjected to an energetic denial, by setting
                        forth that the harsh treatment of which they complain was but the
                        unavoidable consequence of local conditions of the place to which the crew
                        were transported, and that finally the fact that property belonging to the
                        captain and two other persons was hot returned to them is not sufficiently
                        proved:</p>
                    <p>Whereas the defendant party, basing its case upon these allegations and
                        incidentally contesting the amount of the claim, requested that the claims
                        of the party claimant be rejected;</p>

                    <p>Whereas the honorable agent of the party claimant, Mr. Herbert H. D. Peirce,
                        made at the sitting of July 4, 1902, in the name of the Government of the
                        United States of America, the following declarations: <quote

                    <p>That at that time there did not exist any agreement between the two parties,

                        1892, the Government of the United States recognized with regard to the

                        Government, claims which extended to limits far exceeding those which are
                        admitted by the general principles of international law; that these claims
                        were prompted by the interest in the preservation of the seals, and the
                        suppression of illegal sealing, and that while the Government of the United
                        States of America submitted loyally to the decision of the Arbitration
                        Tribunal of 1893, which did not adopt its system, that system nevertheless

                        without such an agreement, even for a Government which had on another

                        principles of international law, since the jurisdiction of a State does not
                        extend beyond the limits of the territorial sea, unless that rule has been
                        derogated by a special convention;</p>
                    <p>Considering that it is not necessary to examine if the presumptions alleged
                        by the defendant party be sufficiently grave to cause the admission that the
                        crew of the <hi rend="italic">C. H. White</hi> were guilty of illegal
                        sealing in Russian territorial waters;</p>
                    <p>Considering that the seizure and confiscation of the <hi rend="italic">C. H.
                            White</hi> and her cargo, as well as the imprisonment of her crew,
                        should therefore be considered as illegal acts, it remains but to fix the
                        amount of indemnity due by the defendant party on account of these acts.</p>
                    <p>II. Considering that the party claimant claims in the first place $35,000 for
                        the confiscation of the vessel, but that that claim is exaggerated; that
                        based upon the figures which are found in the American publications, such as
                        the reports of the fur-seal investigation, sent to the arbitrator by the
                        party claimant (Part III, p. 228), and more particularly on the value
                        specified for vessels having the same or greater tonnage than the <hi
                            rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, there could not be attributed to this
                        schooner, with her boats, her equipment, and her provisions, a value
                        exceeding $10,000;</p>
                    <p>Considering that the party claimant claims for the cargo confiscated with the
                        vessel the following: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) for the 20 seal skins, a
                        sum of $14 each, being a total of $280; but that from a minute examination
                        of the several documents produced, as well as the depositions of experts, it
                        appears that the price per skin is not more than $12, which gives a total of
                        $240 for the 20 skins; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) for 8 casks of mackerel,
                        $160, and for a hogshead of codfish, $260; but that the defendant party,
                        having maintained that the value of the 8 casks of mackerel could not exceed
                        the sum of $80, and that of the hogshead of codfish the sum of $124, the
                        party claimant reduced the claim for that part of the cargo to a sum of
                        $204, which, with the $240 for the 20 seal skins, makes a total of $444;</p>
                    <p>Considering that the party claimant claims (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) $34,720
                        for loss of probable catch of 2,480 seals at $14, and (<hi rend="italic"
                            >b</hi>) $10,300 for loss of probable catch of fish;</p>
                    <p>Considering that while admitting the principle that the loss of catch for the
                        portion of the season still remaining after the seizure of the vessel can be
                        claimed as an element of damages, the amounts claimed are not justified and
                        appear very much exaggerated;</p>
                    <p>Considering (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that from the statistics produced in
                        the litigation it may be admitted that the product of the sealing after the
                        day of seizure of the vessel would certainly not have exceeded the number of
                        1,000 seals, which, at the rate of $12 per skin, gives a total of
                        $12,000;</p>
                    <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0489"/>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) That for the loss of probable catch of fish, a sum
                        of $1,000 seems a sufficient indemnity;</p>
                    <p>Considering with regard to the personal claims of Captain Furman ($25,000),
                        of Andrew Ronning ($15,000), and of Neils Wolfgang ($10,000), for the loss
                        of their property, for their imprisonment, outrages, and privations, that
                        the loss of personal property is not proved—the declarations of the
                        interested parties alone can not be admitted as sufficient evidence; that
                        the defendant party energetically denies that it had any intention of
                        inflicting inhuman treatment upon the captain or crew of the schooner,
                        adding that if their lodgings and their food were insufficient this may be
                        explained by the insufficiency of local resources;</p>
                    <p>Considering that this explanation does not suffice to excuse the defendant
                        party from the responsibility, since, being responsible for the
                        imprisonment, it is also responsible for the consequences of that illegal
                        act;</p>
                    <p>That although the amount of indemnity claimed on that head is exaggerated and
                        should be reduced, for Captain Furman to $3,000, for Andrew Ronning to
                        $2,000, for Neils Wolfgang to $1,000;</p>
                    <p>Considering that the claim of the crew for their imprisonment may be admitted
                        as amounting to $300 per person, being $3,000 for the ten members of the
                        crew;</p>
                    <p>That, consequently, the total of indemnity due from the defendant party to
                        the party claimant on account of the seizure and confiscation of the <hi
                            rend="italic">C. H. White</hi>, reaches $32,444;</p>
                    <p>Considering that the defendant party agrees to add interest at 6 per cent per
                        annum to the sums which it must pay; since indemnity is granted for the loss
                        of the catch during the remainder of the season of 1892, it is just that the
                        interest should not begin to accrue until the 1st January, 1893;</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the arbitrator decides and pronounces the following:</p>
                    <p>The defendant party will pay to the party claimant on account of the claims
                        presented by the parties in interest in the affair of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >C. H. White</hi> the sum of $32,444 in United States money, with
                        interest on that sum at 6 per cent per annum, from the 1st of January, 1893,
                        to the time of full payment.</p>

                    <head>AFFAIR OF THE “KATE AND ANNA.”</head>
                    <p>The undersigned, Tobie Michel Charles Asser, member of the council of state
                        of the Netherlands, exercising the functions of arbitrator, which he has had
                        the honor to have conferred upon him by the Government of the United States
                        of America and the Imperial Government of Russia, to decide as to the
                        differences relating to the affair of the vessel <hi rend="italic">Kate and
                            Anna;</hi></p>
                    <p>Whereas by virtue of the declarations exchanged at St. Petersburg, August 26
                        (September 8), 1900, between the aforesaid two Governments, the arbitrator
                        must take cognizance of the claims for indemnity for the seizure and
                        detention of certain American vessels by Russian cruisers, brought against
                        the Imperial Russian Government by the United States of America in the name
                        of the parties in interest;</p>
                    <p>That according to those declarations the arbitrator, following in his award
                        the general principles of international law and the spirit of international
                        agreements applicable to the subject, shall determine with regard to each
                        claim filed against the Imperial Russian Government whether it is well
                        founded, and if in the affirmative, whether the fact upon which it is based
                        are proved;</p>
                    <p>That, furthermore, it is recognized that this stipulation shall have no
                        retroactive force, and that the arbitrator will apply to the cases in
                        litigation the principles of international law and international treaties
                        which were in force and binding upon the parties engaged in this litigation
                        at the time the seizure of the vessels took place;</p>
                    <p>Finally, that the arbitrator shall fix the amount of the indemnity which may
                        eventually be due from the Russian Government on account of the claims
                        presented by the parties in interest;</p>
                    <p>Whereas after a minute examination of the memoranda and counter memoranda
                        exchanged between the high contracting parties, as well as of all of the
                        exhibits of each side, the arbitrator, availing himself of the right
                        accorded him by the said declarations of St. Petersburg, invited the two
                        Governments to name commercial experts to aid him in fixing the amount of
                        indemnity which would eventually be due, and that when addressing himself to
                        that effect to the two high contracting parties the arbitrator at the same
                        time requested them to furnish supplementary information with regard to the
                        points of law indicated by him;</p>
                    <p>Whereas in the sittings held by the arbitrator at The Hague, in the hall of
                        permanent court of arbitration, from the 27th June to the 4th July, 1902, he
                        heard the depositions of experts in the presence of agents of the high
                        contracting parties, who on that occasion furnished the supplementary
                        information asked by the arbitrator;</p>
                    <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0491"/>
                    <p>Whereas in support of the claim relative to the schooner <hi rend="italic"
                            >Kate mid Anna</hi> and the confiscation of the seal skins found aboard
                        that vessel, the party claimant alleged the following facts:</p>
                    <p>On August 12, 1902, while the said schooner, whose captain was Claus Lutjens,
                        was on the high sea beyond the jurisdiction of territorial waters of all
                        nations, and at a distance of more than 30 miles from the nearest Russian
                        land, and while no member of the crew was either hunting or fishing, the
                        said schooner having been compelled to lay to, was overhauled by the Russian
                        naval cruiser <hi rend="italic">Zabiaka</hi>, whose commander ordered
                        Captain Lutjens to come aboard the cruiser and to bring with him all of his
                        ship’s papers, which was done, and the captain delivered all of his
                        documents to the commander of the Russian cruiser. The latter then ordered
                        that the 124 seal skins which were aboard the schooner be delivered to him,
                        and he declared them confiscated, the captain of the schooner having
                        presumably engaged in sealing in Russian territorial waters. Captain
                        Lutjens, being sent back to his vessel and permitted to continue his course,
                        resolved to quit sealing and return immediately to San Francisco. The
                        commander of the Russian cruiser, before permitting the captain to depart,
                        gave him warning, by which, according to Captain Lutjens, he was ordered to
                        quit sealing and go home, while, according to the defendant party, the
                        warning consisted only in the prohibition to seal in Russian territorial
                        waters.</p>
                    <p>Whereas the defendant party recognized that under the conditions of the
                        encounter with the <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi>, and from the
                        verification of her log book, that the commander of the Russian cruiser had
                        serious reason to consider the American vessel with suspicion, and even to
                        conclude that a portion, at least, of the product of her sealing had been
                        obtained in an illigitimate manner in Russian territorial waters; however,
                        the setting at liberty of the vessel itself, after seizing the cargo which
                        rendered her suspicious, shows a great lack of decision on the part of the
                        cruiser, partly explained by the absence of positive proofs of Captain
                        Lutjens’s guilt; and, therefore, the defendant party, conformedly with the
                        desire to maintain at all times the friendly relations with the American
                        Government, declared its readiness to acknowledge the obligation to pay an
                        indemnity for the actual losses which were caused by the lamentable fact
                        concerning the schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna.</hi></p>
                    <p>Whereas, however, the defendant party insists that the amount of damage
                        justly claimed from it reaches only the sum of $1,240 for the 124 seal skins
                        at $10 each, with interest at 6 per cent per annum from the 12 August
                        1892;</p>
                    <p>Considering that the claimant party claims it is right to demand not only the
                        amount of the price of the 124 seal skins illegally confiscated, but also
                        the loss of the probable catch of 625 seals, basing on this fact that after
                        the schooner <hi rend="italic">Kate and Anna</hi> was stopped the captain
                        resolved not to continue sealing, but to return immediately to San
                        Francisco, and that this resolution was taken in consequence of the warning
                        given him by the commander of the Russian cruiser;</p>
                    <p>Considering that whatever may have been the tenor of this warning, it could
                        not have the effect of preventing the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Kate
                            and Anna</hi> from continuing sealing, and that consequently if the said
                        captain nevertheless resolved to return at once to San Francisco, the
                        defendant party is not responsible for the loss or profit which might have
                        accrued to the schooner;</p>
                    <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0492"/>
                    <p>Considering with regard to the indemnity due for the confiscation of the 124
                        seal skins, for which the claimant party demands $14 per skin, that the
                        defendant party offers $10 per skin, being a total of $1,488 for the 124
                        skins;</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the arbitrator decides and pronounces the following:</p>
                    <p>The defendant party will pay to the claimant party on account of the claims
                        presented by the parties in interest in the affair of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Kate and Anna</hi> the sum of $1,488 in United States money, with
                        interest on that sum at 6 per cent per annum from the 12th August, 1892,
                        until the day of full payment.</p>

                    <head>AFFAIRE DU CAPE HORN PIGEON.</head>
                    <p>Le soussigné, Tobie Michel Charles Asser, Membre du Conseil d’Etat des
                        Pays-Bas, exerant les fonctions d’Arbitre, qu’il a eu l’honneur de se voir
                        conférer par le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis d’Amérique et par le
                        Gouvernement Impérial de Russie, pour juger le différend relatif à l’affaire
                        du navire Cape Horn Pigeon;</p>
                    <p>Attendu qu’en vertu des déclarations échangées entre les deux Gouvernements
                        précités à Saint-Pétersbourg le 26 août 8 septembre 1900, l’Arbitre doit
                        prendre connaissance des réclamations d’indemnité pour l’arrêt ou la saisie
                        de certains navires américains par des croiseurs russes, présentées au
                        Gouvernement Impérial de Russie par le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis
                        d’Amérique, au nom des ayants-droit;</p>
                    <p>que d’après ces déclarations l’Arbitre, en se réglant dans sa sentence sur
                        les principes généraux du droit des gens et sur l’esprit des accords
                        internationaux applicables à la matière, doit décider à l’égard de chaque
                        reclamation formulee à la charge du Gouvernement Impérial de Russie, si elle
                        est bien fondée et, dans l’affirmative, si les faits, sur lesquels elle est
                        basée, sont prouvés;</p>
                    <p>qu’ensuite il a été reconnu que cette stipulation n’aura aucune force
                        rétroactive et que l’Arbitre appliquera aux cas en litige les principes du
                        droit des gens et les traités internationaux qui étaient en vigueur et
                        obligatoires pour les parties impliquées dans ce litige, au moment où la
                        saisie des navires a eu lieu;</p>
                    <p>qu’enfin l’Arbitre doit éventuellement fixer la somme de l’indemnité qui
                        serait due par le Gouvernement Russe pour le compte des réclamations
                        présentées par les ayants-droit;</p>
                    <p>Attendu qu’après un examen minutieux des mémorandums et contrememorandums
                        échangés entre les Hautes Parties, ainsi que de toutes les pièces produites
                        de part et d’autre, l’Arbitre, profitant de la faculté qui lui avait été
                        accordée par lesdites déclarations de Saint-Pétersbourg, a invité les deux
                        Gouvernements à désigner les experts commerciaux pour l’aider à fixer le
                        montant de l’indemnité qui serait éventuellement due et, qu’en s’adressant à
                        cet effet aux deux Hautes Parties, l’Arbitre les a en même temps priées de
                        lui fournir des renseignements suppémentaires à l’égard des points de droit,
                        indiqués par lui;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que dans les séances tenues par l’Arbitre à la Haye dans l’Hôtel de
                        la Cour Permanente d’Arbitrage, depuis le 27 juin jusqu’au 4 juillet 1902,
                        il a entendu les dépositions des experts en présence des Agents des deux
                        Hautes Parties, qui à cette occasion ont fourni les renseignements
                        supplémentaires demandés par l’Arbitre;</p>
                    <p>Attendu qu’à l’appui de la réclamation relative à l’arrêt et la saisie de la
                        barque baleiniere américaine Cape Horn Pigeon par un vaisseau armé du
                        Gouvernement Impérial de Russie, la Partie demanderesse a allégué les faits
                        suivants:</p>
                    <p>La Barque Cape Horn Pigeon, construite pour la pêche de la baleine, ayant
                        fait voile de San Francisco le 7 decembre 1891, avec un équipage de trente
                        personnes hors le capitaine (nommé Scullun ou <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470"
                            facs="0496"/>Scullan) pour un voyage dans les mers du Japon et
                        d’Ochotsk, se trouvait le 10 septembre 1892 dans la mer d’Ochotsk, sur la
                        haute mer, occupée de la pêche de la baleine, lorsqu’elle fut arrêtée et
                        saisie par le commandant d’un navire de la marine russe (croiseur) et
                        conduite à Vladivostok, où elle fut détenue par les autorités russes
                        jusqu’au 1 octobre 1892. Après la saisie de la barque, son équipage fut
                        placé à bord du schooner russe Maria (qui, d’après la déclaration de la
                        Partie défenderesse, avait été saisi par le croiseur russe pour chasse
                        illicite aux phoques) et forcé de le conduire dans le port de Vladivostok.
                        Dans cette ville, apres qu’on leur eut dit qu’ils seraient logés dans la
                        maison de garde, cet abri contre le froid et la faim leur fut refusé et le
                        capitaine se vit forcé de leur trouver un logement dans un hangar. Ils
                        furent retenus de jour en jour sans qu’on leur en dit la raison et enfin le
                        1 octobre 1892 ils furent renvoyés à leur navire;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que la Partie défenderesse a reconnu que dans ce cas il s’est produit
                        une erreur regrettable, puisque c’est à tort que l’officier de marine (le
                        lieutenant von Cube) avait soupconné le Cape Horn Pigeon de s’être livré à
                        une chasse illicite et que par conséquent le Gouvernement Impérial,
                        reconnaissant sa responsabilité, a offert de payer une indemnité pécuniaire
                        pour les pertes réelles causées aux ressortissants étrangers par les actes
                        de ses organes gouvernementaux;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que la tâche de l’Arbitre dans cette affaire consiste done à fixer le
                        montant de l’indemnité à payer par la Partie défenderesse;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que la réclamation de la Partie démanderesse s’éleve à un montant de
                        $80,700, avec les intérêts à 6 pour cent par an depuis le 10 septembre 1892
                        et que la Partie défenderesse a offert de payer $2,500, également avec les
                        intérêts a 6 pour cent par an;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que la Partie défenderesse estime que le premier article de la
                        réclamation, s’élevant à $3,010 pour dépenses du propriétaire du Cape Horn
                        Pigeon en conséquence de la saisie, devrait être réduit à $1,040 et qu’en
                        effet, le montant réclamé n’étant pas suflisamment justifié, il y a lieu de
                        le réduire conformément aux conclusions de la Partie défenderesse;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que pour les services de l’équipage du Cape Horn Pigeon pour avoir
                        conduit le schooner russe à Vladivostok, la somme de $1,000 offerte par la
                        Partie défenderesse, au lieu de la somme de $1,200 réclamée par la Partie
                        demanderesse, semble suffisante;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que la Partie défenderesse admet comme justifiées les réclamations
                        pour provisions consommées $200, pour logement de l’équipage $210, pour
                        dépenses du capitaine Scullun $50, ensemble $460;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que la Partie demanderesse réclame $45,000 pour perte de prises de
                        pêche pendant le temps qui s’est écoulé entre la saisie du navire et le jour
                        où il a pu reprendre la pêche de la baleine;</p>
                    <p>que la Partie défenderesse conteste en principe le bien fondé de cette partie
                        de la demande, en alléguant qu’il s’agit ici du gain d’une entreprise
                        soumise à des risques et qui peut toujours se terminer par des pertes, et en
                        invoquant, a l’appui de son assertion, la sentence du tribunal d’Arbitrage
                        de 1872 dans l’affaire de l’Alabama, par laquelle les demandes
                        d’indemnisation pour dommages indirects ont été écartées;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que le principe général du droit civil, d’après lequel les
                        dommages-intérêts doivent contenir une indemnité non-seulement pour le
                        dommage qu’on a souffert, mais aussi pour le gain dont on a été privé, est
                        également applicable aux litiges internationaux et que, pour pouvoir
                        l’appliquer, il n’est pas nécessaire que le montant du gain <pb n="471"
                            xml:id="pg_471" facs="0497"/>dont on se voit privé puisse être fixé avec
                        certitude, mais qu’il suffit de démontrer que dans l’ordre naturel des
                        ehoses on aurait pu faire un gain dont on se voit privé par le fait qui
                        donne lieu à la réclamation;</p>
                    <p>Considérant qu’il n’est pas question en ce cas d’un dommage <hi rend="italic"
                            >indirect</hi>, mais d’un dommage <hi rend="italic">direct</hi>, dont le
                        montant doit faire l’objet d’une évaluation;</p>
                    <p>Considérant quant au montant de cette partie de la réclamation, que la partie
                        demanderesse prend pour point de départ la moyenne du nombre des baleines
                        prises dans une saison, qu’elle évalue à huit et dont elle déduit le nombre
                        de deux que le capitaine Scullun avait déjà prises, ce qui donne six comme
                        le nombre probable des baleines qui auraient encore été prises par lui, si
                        le navire n’avait pas été arrêté et saisi;</p>
                    <p>Considérant, toutefois, que d’après la déclaration du capitaine Scullun
                        lui-même, il avait pris vingt-huit baleines dans quatre saisons, ce qui fait
                        sept par saison et qu’il est done plus sûr de prendre le chiffre sept comme
                        indiquant pour le baleinier Cape Horn Pigeon la moyenne de la prise par
                        saison, ce qui, après déduction des deux baleines prises, donne un nombre de
                        cinq pour le restant probable de la prise;</p>
                    <p>Considérant en ce qui concerne la valeur approximative d’une baleine à
                        l’époque où le produit de la pêche du Cape Horn Pigeon en 1892 aurait pu
                        etre vendu, qu’il résulte de l’enquête qui a eu lieu dans ce litige et des
                        renseignements fournis à l’Arbitre, qu’on peut évaluer le poid moyen des os
                        à obtenir d’une baleine à 1,200 livres, et le prix moyen d’une livre à $4;
                        la quantité moyenne de l’huile à 100 barriques et le prix moyen d’une
                        barrique à $12, ce qui fait un total de $6,000 par baleine et de $30,000
                        pour cinq baleines, ou, après déduction de $1,500, au lieu des $1,800
                        déduits par le capitaine Scullun, $28,500;</p>
                    <p>Considérant par rapport à l’indemnité rédamée pour l’enrôlement à $1,000 par
                        homme, soit $31,000, qu’il n’est pas prouvé qu’on ait fait subir aux membres
                        de l’équipage les mauvais traitements dont ils se plaignent; mais que, d’un
                        autre côté, le fait même qu’ils ont été retenus contre leur gré à
                        Vladivostok pendant environ trois semaines, comme conséquence de la saisie
                        iliégale de leur navire, leur donne droit à une indemnité, indépendamment de
                        ce qui leur est dû pour avoir été forcés de conduire un navire russe à
                        Vladivostok, et que le montant de cette indemnité doit être fixé à $7,750 ou
                        en moyenne $250 par personne;</p>
                    <p>Que, par conséquent, le total des dommages-intérêts dus par la Partie
                        défenderesse à la Partie demanderesse comme suite de l’arrêt et de la saisie
                        du Cape Horn Pigeon, s’éiève à $38,750;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que la Partie défenderesse rconnaît comme parfaitement régulière
                        l’adjonction des intérêts à 6 pour cent par an;</p>
                    <p>Par ces motifs,</p>
                    <p>L’Arbitre décide et prononce ce qui suit:</p>
                    <p>La Partie Défenderesse paiera à la Partie Demanderesse pour le compte des
                        réclamations présentées par les ayants-droit dans l’affaire du Cape Horn
                        Pigeon, la somme de $38,750 des Etats-Unis d’Amérique, avec les intérêts de
                        cette somme à 6 pour cent par an depuis le 9 septembre 1892 jusqu’au jour du
                        paiement intégral.</p>

                    <head>AFFAIRE DU JAMES HAMILTON LEWIS.</head>
                    <p>Le soussigné Tobie Michel Charles Asser, Membre du Conseil d’Etat des
                        Pays-Bas, exerçant les fonctions d’Arbitre, qu’il a eu l’honneur de se voir
                        conférer par le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis d’Amérique et par le
                        Gouvernement Impérial de Russie, pour juger le différend relatif à l’affaire
                        du schooner James Hamilton Lewis;</p>
                    <p>Attendu qu’en vertu des déclarations échangées entre les deux Gouvernements
                        précités, à Saint-Pétersbourg le 26 août/8 septembre 1900, l’Arbitre doit
                        prendre connaissance des réclamations d’indemnité pour l’arrêt ou la saisie
                        de certains navires américains par des croiseurs russes, présentées au
                        Gouvernement Impérial de Russie par le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis
                        d’Amérique, au nom des ayants-droit;</p>
                    <p>Qué d’après ces déclarations l’Arbitre, en se réglant dans sa sentence sur
                        les principes généraiix du droit des gens et sur l’esprit des accords
                        internationaux applicables à la matière, doit décider à l’égard de chaque
                        réclamation formulée à la charge du Gouvernement Impérial de Russie, si elle
                        est fondée et, dans l’affirmative, si les faits sur lesquels elle est basée
                        sont prouvés;</p>
                    <p>Qu’ensuite il a été reconnu que cette stipulation n’aura aucune force
                        rétroactive et que l’Arbitre appliquera aux cas en litige les principes du
                        droit des gens et les traités internationaux qui étaient en vigueur et

                        saisie des navires a eu lieu;</p>
                    <p>Qu’enfin l’Arbitre doit éventuellement fixer la somme de l’indemnité qui
                        serait due par le Gouvernement russe pour le compte des réclamations
                        présentées par les ayants-droit;</p>
                    <p>Attendu qu’après un examen minutieux des mémorandums et contremémorandums
                        échangés entre les Hautes Parties, ainsi que de toutes les pièces produites
                        de part et d’autre, l’Arbitre, profitant de la faculté qui lui avait été
                        accordée par lesdites déclarations de Saint-Pétersbourg, a invité les deux
                        Gouvernements à désigner des experts commerciaux pour Paider à fixer le
                        montant de l’indemnité, qui serait éventuellement due et, qu’en s’adressant
                        à cet effet aux deux Hautes Parties, l’Arbitre les a en même temps priées de
                        lui fournir des renseignements supplémentaires à l’égard des points de droit
                        indiqués par lui;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que dans les séances tenues par l’Arbitre à la Haye, dans l’Hôtel de
                        la Cour Permanente d’Arbitrage, depuis le 27 juin jusqu’au 4 juillet 1902,
                        il a entendu les dépositions des experts, en présence des Agents des deux
                        Hautes Parties, qui à cette occasion ont fourni les renseignements
                        supplémentaires demandés par l’Arbitre;</p>
                    <p>Attendu qu’à l’appui de la réclamation relative à la saisie et la
                        confiscation du schooner James Hamilton Lewis, la partie demanderesse a
                        allégué les faits suivants:</p>
                    <p>Ledit schooner ayant fait voile de San Francisco le 7 mai 1891, destiné à un
                        voyage dans l’Océan Pacifique du Nord, pour une expédition de pêche et de
                        chasse, avec Alexandre McLean comme capitaine, <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473"
                            facs="0499"/>se trouva le 2 août 1891 à environ 20 milles de distance à
                        Pest de l’île de Cuivre (latitude 55° 35′ Nord, longitude 169° 21′ Est),
                        quand il fut saisi de très-bonne heure par le croiseur russe Aléoute. Le
                        capitaine du schooner avait jugé nécessairé d’atterrir afin de vérifier son
                        chronomètre et pour cette raison il s’était dirigé sur l’île de Cuivre. A
                        Pendroit mentionné son navire fut obligé de mettre en panne par un coup de
                        canon tiré dudit croiseur et une chaloupe de ce croiseur s’étant approchée
                        du schooner, un officier de la marine russe monta de la chaloupe à bord du
                        schooner, requit le livre de bord ofliciel, qui lui fut présenté par le
                        capitaine et l’emporta avec lui en retournant à son navire. Bientôt il
                        revint avec quelques hommes armés et ordonna au capitaine McLean de quitter
                        son navire et de se constituer prisonnier à bord del’Aléoute, avec tout son
                        équipage excepté sept hommes. Le capitaine McLean ayant refusé d’obéir à cet
                        ordre, fit reprendre au schooner son cours Est: alors le commandant du
                        croiseur commença une poufsuite et, tournant le James Hamilton Lewis, le
                        captura par la force des armes: le capitaine et les membres de l’équipage
                        furent faits prisonniers. Le 3 août 1891 le schooner et son équipage furent
                        conduits à Vladivostok; le navire, avec sa cargaison, son armement et la
                        propriété personnelle du capitaine fut confisqué; son capitaine, ses
                        officiers et son équipage furent retenus prisonniers et soumis à un
                        traitement indigne et rigoureux: après avoir été relâchés ils ont été
                        abandonnés à leur sort pour rentrer chez eux corhme ils le pourraient;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que les dommages-intérêts réclamés par la Partie demanderesse pour le
                        compte des ayants-droit, pour la saisie et la confiscation du navire et
                        l’emprisonnement du capitaine et de l’équipage, s’élèvent à un montant de
                        $101,336, avec les intérêts à 6 pour cent par an;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que la Partie défenderesse, répondant aux allégations de la Partie
                        demanderesse, a soutenu que lorsque le James Hamilton Lewis fut remarqué par
                        le croiseur, il ne se trouvait qu’à une distance de 5 milles au plus de
                        l’île Medny (ou île de Cuivre) et que l’arrêt a eu lieu à une distance de 12
                        (ou 11) milles de la côte; qu’en outre il résulterait d’une série de faits
                        relevés par la Partie défenderesse, que le James Hamilton Lewis doit être
                        présumé s’être rendu coupable d’une chasse illicite aux phoques dans les
                        eaux territoriales russes; que par conséquent les organes du Gouvernement
                        Impérial étaient en droit, de poursuivre le schooner même en dehors de ces
                        eaux, de le saisir et de le confisquer avec sa cargaison; que
                        l’emprisonnement de l’équipage a eu lieu à cause de leur résistance a
                        l’arrêt et à la saisie du navire;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que la Partie défenderesse, s’appuyant sur ces allégations, et en
                        contestant subsidiairement les chiffres de la demande, a requis que les
                        réclamations de la Partie demanderesse fussent rejetées;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que Phonorable Agent de la Partie demanderesse, M. Herbert H. D.
                        Peirce, a fait, dans la séance du 1 juillet 1902, au nom du Gouvernement des
                        Etats-Unis d’Amérique, la déclaration suivante: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        </list></p>
                    <p>Ad I. Considérant que cette question doit être résolue d’après les principes
                        généraux du droit des gens et l’esprit des accords internationaux en vigueur
                        et obligatoires pour les deux Hautes Parties au moment de la saisie du
                        navire;</p>
                    <p>qu’à ce moment il n’existait point de convention entre les deux Parties,
                        contentant pour la matière spéciale de la chasse aux phoques une dérogation
                        aux principes généraux du droit des gens par rapport à l’étendue de la mer
                        territoriale;</p>
                    <p>que la Partie défenderesse a fait ressortir que dans le litige entre les
                        Etats-Unis d’Amérique et la Grande Bretagne devant le Tribunal d’Arbitrage,
                        constitué en vertu du Traité conclu à Washington le 29 février 1892, le
                        Gouvernement des Etats-Unis a fait valoir par rapport au droit de
                        jurisdiction dans la mer de Behring vis-à-vis du Gouvernement Britannique,
                        des revendications qui s’étendaient à des. limites bien autrement
                        considérables que celles qui sont admises d’après les principes géneraux du
                        droit des gens; que ces revendications étaient motivées par l’intérêt de la
                        race des phoques et de la répression de la chasse illicite, et que, bien que
                        le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis d’Amérique se soit loyalement soumis à la
                        décision du Tribunal Arbitral de 1893, qui n’a pas adopté son système, ce
                        système peut néanmoins lui être opposé pour combattre la demande formulée
                        par ce Gouvernement dans le litige actuel;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que, quelle que soit la valeur du système dont il s’agit comme
                        base d’une entente entre les états intéressés, il ne saurait être
                        obligatoire sans une telle entente, même pour un Gouvernement qui à une
                        autre occasion l’aurait défendu, mais sans succès, devant un Tribunal
                        Arbitral;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que les accords qui seraient intervenus entre les Parties après
                        la date de la saisie et de la confiscation du James Hamilton Lewis, ne
                        sauraient modifier les conséquences résultant des principes de droit
                        généralement reconnue à l’époque de ces actes;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que la saisie du schooner a eu lieu, d’après la Partie
                        demanderesse à une distance d’environ 20, d’après la Partie défenderesse à
                        une distance d’environ 11 à 12 milles du territoire russe et que, même si la
                        dernière version est la vraie, il en résulte que l’acte s’est accompli en
                        dehors des eaux territoriales de la Russie, ce qui du reste est admis par
                        les deux Parties;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que le système de la Partie défenderesse d’après lequel il serait
                        permis aux navires de guerre d’un état de poursuivre même en dehors de la
                        mer territoriale un navire dont l’équipage se serait rendu coupable d’un
                        acte illicite dans les eaux territoriales ou sur le territoire de cet état,
                        ne saurait etre reconnu comme conforme au droit des gens, <pb n="475"
                            xml:id="pg_475" facs="0501"/>puisque la juridiction d’un état ne s’étend
                        pas au-delà des limites de la mer territoriale, à moins qu’il n’ait été
                        dérogé à cette règle par une convention expresse;</p>
                    <p>Considérant qu’il n’est done pas nécessaire d’examiner si les présomptions
                        ailéguées par la Partie défenderesse sont assez graves pour faire admettre
                        que l’équipage du James Hamilton Lewis se soit rendu coupable de la chasse
                        illicite aux phoques dans les eaux territoriales ou sur le territoire de la
                        Russie;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que la saisie et la confiscation du James Hamilton Lewis et de sa
                        cargaison, ainsi que l’émprisonnement de l’équipage, devant par conséquent
                        être considérés comme des actes illégaux, il ne reste qu’à fixer le montant
                        de l’indemnité due du chef de ces actes par la Partie défenderesse;</p>
                    <p>Ad. II. Considérant que la Partie demanderesse réclame en premier lieu
                        $25,000 pour la confiscation du navire, mais que cette réclamation est
                        exagérée; qu’en se basant sur les chiffres qu’on trouve dans des
                        publications américaines communiquées à l’Arbitre par la Partie demanderesse
                        (Report of fur-seal investigations, 1899, Part III, p. 228), et plus
                        spécialement sur la valeur indiquée pour les navires ayant environ le même
                        ou un plus grand tonnage que le James Hamilton Lewis et en tenant compte
                        d’une part du fait que ce schooner se trouvait dans un excellent état,
                        d’autre part de la circonstance qu’ayant pris la mer le 7 mars 1891, il
                        avait déjà consommé presque cinq mois de ses provisions le jour où il a été
                        arrêté (2 août 1892), on ne saurait attribuer à ce navire avec ses
                        chaloupes, son armement et ses provisions, une valeur dépassant le chiffre
                        de $9,000;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que la Partie demanderesse réclame pour les 424 peaux de phoques,
                        confisquées avec le navire, $14 par peau, soit un total de $5,936, mais
                        qu’il résulte d’un examen minutieux des différents documents produits ainsi
                        que des dépositions d’experts, que le prix d’une peau ne saurait etre êstimé
                        à plus de $12, ce qui fait un total de $5,088 pour les 426 peaux;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que la Partie demanderesse réclame $36,400 pour perte de prise
                        probable de 2,600 peaux, soit $14 par peau, mais que, tout en admettant
                        qu’en principe la perte de prise pendant la partie de la saison qui devait
                        encore s’écouler après la saisie du navire, peut être rélcamée comme un
                        élément des dommages-intérêts, le chiffre de 2,600 peaux n’est nullement
                        justifié et paraît très-exagéré; qu’il résulte des statistiques produites au
                        litige, qu’en tenant compte du nombre des phoques déjà pris et du temps qui
                        devait encore s’écouler jusqu’à la fin de la saison, on peut admettre que le
                        produit de la chasse n’aurait pas excédé le nombre de 500 phoques; ce qui, à
                        raison de $12 par peau, donne un total de $6,000;</p>
                    <p>Considérant qu’en dernier lieu la Partie demanderesse réclame, au profit de
                        l’équipage du James Hamilton Lewis, pour son emprisonnement, ses souffrances
                        physiques et morales, etc., $2,000 pour chacun des 17 hommes, soit $34,000;
                        que la partie défenderesse nie énergiquement que les plaintes formulées par
                        l’équipage au sujet d’actes de violence et de mauvais traitements qu’ils
                        auraient subis soient fondées et qu’en eflet la preuve de ces allégations
                        n’est pas fournie; que toutefois le fait même de l’emprisonnement illégal
                        donne aux intéressés le droit de réclamer une indemnité dont le montant
                        peut, d’après une évaluation équitable, être fixé à $8,500, ou en moyenne
                        $500 par personne;</p>
                    <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0502"/>
                    <p>Que, par conséquent, le total des dommages-intérêts dus par la Partie
                        défenderesse à la Partie demanderesse comme suite de la saisie et la
                        confiscation du James Hamilton Lewis, s’élève à $28,588;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que la Partie défenderesse accepte d’ajouter les intérêts à 6
                        pour cent par an aux sommes qu’elle aurait à payer; que, puisqu’une
                        indemnité est accordée pour la perte de prise pendant le reste de la saison
                        de 1891, il est juste que les interets ne commencent à courir que le 1
                        Janvier 1892;</p>

                    <head>AFFAIRE DU C. H. WHITE.</head>
                    <p>Le soussigné Tobie Michel Charles Asser, Membre du Conseil d’Etat des
                        Pays-Bas, exercant les fonctions d’Arbitre, qu’il a eu l’honneur de se voir
                        conférer par le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis d’Amérique et par le
                        Gouvernement Impérial de Russie, pour juger le différend relatif à l’affaire
                        du schooner C. H. White;</p>
                    <p>Attendu qu’en vertu des déclarations échangées entre les deux Gouvernements
                        précités, à Saint-Pétersbourg le 26 août 8 septembre 1900, l’Arbitre doit
                        prendre connaissance des réclamations d’indemnité pour l’arrêt ou la saisie
                        de certains navires américains par des croiseurs russes, présentées au
                        Gouvernement Impérial de Russie par le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis
                        d’Amérique, au nom des ayants-droit;</p>
                    <p>Que d’après ces déclarations l’Arbitre, en se réglant dans sa sentence sur
                        les principes généraux du droit des gens et sur l’esprit des accords
                        internationaux applicables à la matière, doit décider à l’égard de chaque
                        réclamation formulée à la charge du Gouvernement Impérial de Russie, si elle
                        est fondée et, dans l’affirmative, si les faits sur lesquels elle est basée
                        sont prouvés;</p>
                    <p>Qu’ensuite il a été reconnu que cette stipulation n’aura aucune force
                        retroactive et que l’Arbitre appliquera aux cas en litige les principes du
                        droit des gens et les traités internationaux qui étaient en vigueur et
                        obligatoires pour les parties impliquées dans ce litige, au moment où la
                        saisie des navires a eu lieu;</p>
                    <p>Qu’enfin l’Arbitre doit éventuellement fixer la somme de l’indemnité qui
                        serait due par le Gouvernement russe pour le compte des réclamations
                        présentées par les ayants-droit;</p>
                    <p>Attendu qu’après un examen minutieux des mémorandums et contre mémorandums
                        échangés entre les Hautes Parties, ainsi que de toutes les pièces produites
                        de part et d’autre, l’Arbitre, profitant de la faculté qui lui avait été
                        accordée par lesdites déclarations de Saint Pétersbourg, a invité les deux
                        Gouvernements à désigner des experts commerciaux pour l’aider à fixer le
                        montant de l’indemnité, qui serait éventuellement due et; qu’en s’adressant
                        à cet effet aux deux Hautes Parties, l’Arbitre les a en même temps priées de
                        lui fournir des renseignements supplémentaires à l’égard des points de droit
                        indiqués par lui;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que dans les séances tenues par l’Arbitre à la Haye, dans l’Hôtel de
                        la Cour Permanente d’Arbitrage, depuis le 27 juin jusqu’au 1 juillet 1902,
                        il a entendu les dépositions des experts, en présence des Agents des deux
                        Hautes Parties, qui à cette occasion ont fourni les renseignements
                        supplémentaires demandés par l’Arbitre;</p>
                    <p>Attendu qu’à Pappui de la réclamation relative à la saisie et la confiscation
                        du schooner C. H. White la partie demanderesse a allégué les faits
                        suivants:</p>
                    <p>Ledit schooner ayant fait voile de San Francisco le 7 mai 1892 pour un voyage
                        de pêche et de chasse dans l’Océan Pacifique du Nord ou <pb n="478"
                            xml:id="pg_478" facs="0504"/>ailleurs, avec Lawrence M. Furman comme
                        capitaine, se trouvait le 12 juillet 1892 à une distance d’environ 40 miles
                        au sud de l’île Agattou, une des îles Aléontiennes, et environ le même jour
                        le capitaine mit à la voile pour les îles Kuriles, ayant l’intention d’y
                        pêcher à une distance de la côte. Le capitaine dévia de sa course vers les
                        îles Kuriles dans la direction de l’île de Cuivre ou l’île de Behring, pour
                        y régler son chronomètre. Le 15 juillet 1892, le navire ayant atteint la
                        lattitude de 54° 18’ Nord par longitude 167° 19’ Est (c’est évidemment par
                        erreur qu’à quelques endroits du mémorandum de la partie demanderesse on
                        trouve indiqué comme longitude 167° 19’ Quest) a été abordé par le croiseur
                        de guerre russe le Zabiaca et il fut ordonné au capitaine du C. H. White de
                        venir à bord de ce croiseur avec tous ses papiers de bord; le commandant du
                        croiseur ayant examiné ces papiers, fit arrêter le capitaine du schooner et
                        transporter tout son équipage, excepté le lieutenant en premier, à bord du
                        croiseur, comme prisonniers: le capitaine fut gardé à vue. Le schooner (avec
                        la cargaison composée de 20 peaux de phoques, 8 barriques de maquereaux et 1
                        tonneau de morue) fut saisi et remorqué jusqu’à la baie de Nikolsky (île de
                        Behring), d’où il fut conduit à Petropavlovsk; plus tard il fut confisqué et
                        approprié à l’usage du Gouvernement Impérial de Russie. Le capitaine et
                        l’équipage du schooner furent emmenés comme prisonniers jusqu’à
                        Petropavlovsk, où ils arrivèrent le 20 juillet 1892. Le 8 août de la même
                        année l’équipage fut conduit à bord du navire américian Majestic pour être
                        rapatrié. Le capitaine et les autres membres de l’équipage prétendent avoir
                        beaucoup souffert des mauvais traitements qui leur auraient été infligés
                        pendant leur emprisonnement. En outre le capitaine, le lieutenant en premier
                        Andrew Ronning et le chasseur Neils Wolfgang prétendent avoir perdu des
                        objets qui leur appartenaient et qu’on ne leur a pas restitués;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que les dommages-intérêts réclamés par la Partie demanderesse pour le
                        compte des ayants-droit, du chef des faits mentionnés, s’éievent à un
                        montant de $150,720 avec les intérêts a 6 pour cent par an;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que la Partie défenderesse, répondant aux allégations de la Partie
                        demanderesse, soutient que la saisie du C. H. White, a eu lieu non pas sous
                        54° 18’, mais sous 54° 10’ de latitude Nord, soit à une distance d’environ
                        23 miles seulement de la côte russe la plus voisine; qu’en outre d’une série
                        de circonstances relevées par la Partie défenderesse résultait la
                        présomption que le C. H. White se serait rendu coupable de chasse illicite
                        aux phoques dans les eaux territoriales russes;</p>
                    <p>que par suite les organes du Gouvernement Impérial étaient en droit de
                        poursuivre le schooner, même en dehors de ces eaux, de le saisir et de le
                        confisquer avec sa cargaison;</p>
                    <p>que la Partie défenderesse oppose aux plaintes de l’équipage concernant de
                        mauvais traitements qu’il aurait subis, une dénegation énergique, en faisant
                        observer que ce dont on se plaint n’était que la conséquence inévitable des
                        circonstances locales de Fendroit où l’équipage a été conduit et qu’enfin le
                        fait que des objets appartenant au capitaine et à deux autres personnes ne
                        leur auraient pas été rendus, n’est pas suffisamment prouvé;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que la partie défenderesse, s’appuyant sur ces allégations, et en
                        contestant subsidiairement les chiffres de la demande, a requis que les
                        réclamations de la Partie demanderesse fussent rejetées;</p>

                    <p>Attendu que l’honorable Agent de la Partie demanderesse, M. Herbert H. D.
                        Peirce, a fait, dans la séance du 4 juillet 1902, au nom du Gouvernement des

                    <p>Ad I. Considérant que cette question doit être résolue d’après les principes
                        généraux du droit des gens et l’esprit des accords internationaux en vigueur
                        et obligatoires pour les deux Hautes Parties au moment de la saisie du
                        navire;</p>
                    <p>qu’à ce moment il n’existait point de convention entre les deux Parties
                        contenant pour la matière spéciale de la chasse aux phoques une dérogation
                        aux principes généraux du droit des gens par rapport à l’étendue de la mer
                        territoriale;</p>
                    <p>que la Partie défenderesse a fait ressortir que dans le litige entre les
                        Etats-Unis d’Amérique et la Grande Bretagne devant le Tribunal d’Arbitrage,
                        constitué en vertu du Traité conclu à Washington le 29 février 1892, le
                        Gouvernement des Etats-Unis a fait valoir par rapport au droit de
                        juridiction dans la mer de Behring, vis-à-vis du Gouvernement Britannique,
                        des revendications qui s’étendaient à des limites bien autrement
                        considérables que celles qui sont admises d’après les principes généraux du
                        droit des gens; que ces revendications étaient motivées par l’intérêt de la
                        préservation de la race des phoques et de la répression de la chasse
                        illicite, et que, bien que le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis d’Amérique se soit
                        loyalement soumis à la décision du Tribunal Arbitral de 1893, qui n’a pas
                        adopté son système, ce système peut néanmoins lui être opposé pour combattre
                        la demande formulée par ce Gouvernement dans le litige actuel;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que, quelle que soit la valeur du système dont il s’agit comme
                        base d’une entente entre les états intéressés, il ne saurait être
                        obligatoire sans une telle entente, même pour un Gouvernement qui à une
                        autre occasion l’aurait défendu, mais sans succès, devant un Tribunal
                        Arbitral;</p>

                        la date de la saisie et de la confiscation du C. H. White, ne <pb n="480"
                            xml:id="pg_480" facs="0506"/>sauraient modifier les conséquences
                        résultant des principes de droit généralement reconnus à l’époque de ces
                        actes;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que la saisie du schooner a eu lieu, d’après la Partie
                        demanderesse à une distance d’environ 20, d’après la Partie défenderesse à
                        une distance’ d’environ 11 à 12 milles du territoire russe et que, même si
                        la dernière version est la vraie, il en résulte que l’acte s’est accompli en
                        dehors des eaux territoriales de la Russie, ce qui du reste est adrnis par
                        les deux Parties;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que le système de la Partie défenderesse d’après lequel il serait
                        permis aux navires de guerre d’un état de poursuivre même en dehors de la
                        mer territoriale un navire dont l’équipage se serait rendu coupable d’un
                        acte illicite dans les eaux territoriales ou sur le territoire de cet état,
                        ne saurait être reeonnu comme conforme au droit des gens, puisque la
                        juridiction d’un état ne s’étend pas au-delà des limites de la mer
                        territoriale, à moins qu’il n’ait été derogé à cette règie par une
                        convention expresse;</p>
                    <p>Considérant qu’il n’est done pas nécessaire d’examiner si les présomptions
                        alléguées par la Partie défenderesse sont assez graves pour faire admettre
                        que l’équipage du C. H. White se serait rendu coupable de la chasse illicite
                        aux phoques dans les eaux territoriales ou sur le territoire de la
                        Russie;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que la saisie et la confiscation du C. H. White et de sa
                        cargaison, ainsi que l’emprisonnement de l’équipage, devant par conséquent
                        être considérés comme des actes illégaux, il ne reste qu’à fixer le montant
                        de l’indemnité due du chef de ces actes par la partie défenderesse:</p>
                    <p>Ad II. Considèrant que la Partie demanderesse réclame en premier lieu $35,000
                        pour la confiscation du navire, mais que cette réclamation est exagérée;
                        qu’en se basant sur les chiffres qu’on trouve dans des publications
                        américaines, comme les rapports des enquêtes concernant les phoques à
                        fourrure (Report of fur-seal investigation) communiqués à l’Arbitre par la
                        Partie demanderesse (Part III, p. 228) et plus spécialement sur la valeur
                        indiquée pour des navires ayant environ le même ou un plus grand tonnage que
                        le C. H. White, on ne saurait attribuer à ce schooner, avec ses chaloupes,
                        son armement et ses provisions, une valeur plus grande que $10,000;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que la Partie demanderesse réclame pour la cargaison, confisquée
                        avec le navire, ce qui suit: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) pour les 20 peaux de
                        phoque une somme de $14 par peau, soit en total $280; mais qu’il résulte
                        d’un examen minutieux des différents documents produits ainsi que des
                        dépositions des experts, que le prix d’une peau ne saurait être estimé à
                        plus de $12, ce qui fait un total de $240 pour les 20 peaux; (<hi
                            rend="italic">b</hi>) pour 8 barriques de maquereaux $160 et pour un
                        tonneau de morue $260; mais que la Partie défenderesse ayant soutenu que la
                        valeur des 8 barriques de maquereaux ne peut avoir excédé la somme de $80 et
                        celle du tonneau de morue la somme de $124, la Partie demanderesse a réduit
                        sa réclamation pour cette partie de la cargaison à une somme de $204, ce qui
                        avec les $240 pour les 20 peaux de phoques, fait un total de $444;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que la Partie demanderesse réclame (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                        $34,720 pour perte de prise probable de 2,480 peaux de phoques à $14 et (<hi

                        poissons;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que tout en admettant en principe que la perte de prise pour la
                        partie de la saison qui devait encore s’écouler après la saisie <pb n="481"
                            xml:id="pg_481" facs="0507"/>du navire pent être réclamée comme un
                        élément des dommage-intérets, les sommes réclamées ne sont nullement
                        justifiées et paraissent trèsexagérées;</p>
                    <p>Considérant ad (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) qu’il résulte des statistiques
                        produites au litige qu’on peut admettre que le produit de la chasse aux
                        phoques après le jour de la saisie du navire, n’aurait certainement pas
                        excédé le nombrev de 1,000 phoques, ce qui, à raison de $12 par peau, donne
                        un total de $12,000;</p>
                    <p>ad (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) que pour la perte de prise probable de poissons
                        une somme de $1,000 semble une indemnité suffisante;</p>
                    <p>Considérant à l’égard des réclamations personnelles du capitaine Furman
                        ($25,000), d’Andrew Ronning ($15, 000) et de Neils Wolfgang ($10,000) pour
                        perte d’objets qui leur appartenaient, pour emprisonnement, outrages et
                        privations,—que la perte des objets n’est pas prouvée, les déclarations des
                        intéressés seuls ne pouvant être admises comme une preuve suffisante; que la
                        Partie déf enderesse nie énergiquement qu’on ait eu l’intention d’infliger
                        au capitaine et à l’équipage du schooner un traitement inhumain, en ajoutant
                        que si leur logement et leur nourriture laissaient à désirer, ceci
                        s’explique par l’insuffiance des ressources locales;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que cette explication ne suffit pas pour dégager la
                        responsabilité de la Partie défenderesse, puisqu’étant responsable de
                        l’emprisonnement, elle Fest aussi des conséquences decet acte illégal;</p>
                    <p>que toutefois le montant de Pindemnite réclamée de ce chef est exagéré et
                        doit être réduit pour le capitaine Furman à $3,000, pour Andrew Ronning à
                        $2,000, pour Neils Wolfgang à $1,000;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que la réclamation de l’équipage pour son emprisonnement peut
                        être admise pour un montant de $300 par personne, soit $3,000 pour les dix
                        membres de l’équipage;</p>
                    <p>Que, par conséquent, le total des dommages-intérêts dus par la Partie
                        défenderesse à la Partie demanderesse comme suite de la saisie et la
                        confiscation du C. H. White, s’élève à $32,444;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que la Partie défenderesse accepte d’aj outer les intérêts a à
                        pour cent par an aux sommes qu’elle aurait a payer; que puisqu’une indemnité
                        est accordée pour la perte de prise pendant le reste de la saison de 1892,
                        il est juste que les intérêts ne commencent à courir que le 1 Janvier
                        1893;</p>
                    <p>Par ces motifs</p>
                    <p>L’Arbitre décide et prononce ce qui suit:</p>
                    <p>La Partie Défenderesse paiera à la Partie Demanderesse pour le compte des
                        réclamations présentées par les ayants-droit dans l’affaire du C. H. White
                        la somme de $32,444 des Etats-Unis d’Amérique avec les intérêts de cette
                        somme à 6 pour cent par an depuis le 1 Janvier 1893 jusqu’au jour du
                        paiement intégral.</p>

                    <head>AFFAIRE DU KATE AND ANNA.</head>
                    <p>Le soussigné, Tobie Michel Charles Asser, Membre du Conseil d’Etat des
                        Pays-Bas, exerçant les fonctions d’Arbitre, qu’il a eu l’honneur de se voir
                        conférer par le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis d’Amérique et par le
                        Gouvernement Impérial de Russie, pour juger le différend relatif à l’affaire
                        du navire Kate and Anna;</p>
                    <p>Attendu qu’en vertu des déclarations échangées entre les deux Gouvernements
                        précités à Saint-Pétersbourg le 26 août 8 septembre 1900, l’Arbitre doit
                        prendre connaissance de réclamations d’indemnité pour l’arrêt ou la saisie
                        de certains navires américains par des croiseurs russes, présentées au
                        Gouvernement Impérial de Russie par le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis
                        d’Amérique, aunom des ayants-droit;</p>
                    <p>que d’après ces déclarations l’Arbitre, en se réglant dans sa sentence sur
                        les principes généraux du droit des gens et sur l’esprit des accords
                        internationaux applicables à la matière, doit décider à l’égard de chaq ue
                        réclamation formulée à la charge du Gouvernement Impérial de Russie, si elle
                        est bien fondée et, dans l’aflirmative, si les faits, sur lesquels elle est
                        basée, sont prouvés;</p>
                    <p>qu’ensuite il a été reeonnu que cette stipulation n’aura aucune force
                        rétroactive et que l’Arbitre appliquera aux cas en litige les principes du
                        droit des gens et les traités internationaux qui étaient en vigueur et
                        obligatoires pour les parties impliquées dans ce litige, au moment où la
                        saisie des navires a eu lieu;</p>
                    <p>qu’enfin l’Arbitre doit éventuellement fixer la somme de l’indemnité qui
                        serait due par le Gouvernement russe pour le compte des réclamations
                        présentées par les ayants-droit;</p>
                    <p>Attendu qu’après un examen minutieux des mémorandums et contre mémorandums
                        échangés entre les Hautes Parties, ainsi que de toutes les pièces produites
                        de part et d’autre, l’Arbitre, profitant de la faculté qui lui avait été
                        accordée par lesdites déclarations de Saint-Pétersbourg, a invité les deux
                        Gouvernements à désigner des experts commerciaux pour l’aider à fixer le
                        montant de l’indemnité qui serait éventuellement due et, qu’en s’adressant à
                        cet effet aux deux Hautes Parties, l’Arbitre les a en même temps priées de
                        lui fournir des renseignements supplémentaires à l’égard des points de
                        droit, indiqués par lui;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que dans les séances tenues par l’Arbitre à la Haye dans l’Hôtel de
                        la Cour Permanente d’Arbitrage, depuis le 27 juin jusqu’au 4 juillet 1902,
                        il a entendu les dépositions des experts en présence des Agents des deux
                        Hautes Parties, qui à cette occasion ont fourni les renseignements
                        supplémentaires demandés par l’Arbitre;</p>
                    <p>Attendu qu’à Pappui de la réclamation relative au schooner Kate and Anna et
                        la confiscation des peaux de phoques, trouvées à bord de ce navire, la
                        partie demanderesse a allégué les faits suivants:</p>
                    <p>Le 12 août 1902, lorsque ledit schooner, qui avait pour capitaine Claus
                        Lutjens, se trouvait sur la haute mer en dehors de la juridiction et des
                        eaux territoriales de toutes nations et à une distance de plus de <pb
                            n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0509"/>30 milles de la terre russe la plus
                        proche, et tandis qu’aucun membre de l’équipage ne chassait ou ne pêchait,
                        ledit schooner ayant été contraint par un croiseur de la marine russe le
                        Zabiaca de mettre en panne, fut abordé par le Zabiaca dont le commandant
                        ordonna au capitaine Lutjens de venir à bord du croiseur et d’apporter avec
                        lui tous les documents du schooner, ce qui fut fait par le capitaine
                        Lutjens, qui délivra tous ses documents au commandant du croiseur russe.
                        Celui-ci ordonna ensuite que les 124 peaux de phoque qui se trouvaient à
                        bord du schooner lui fussent délivrées et il les déclara confisquées, le
                        capitaine du schooner étant présumé s’être livre à la chasse aux phoques
                        dans les eaux territoriales russes. Le capitaine Lutjens, renvoyé à son
                        navire, qu’on laissa libre de continuer sa marche, résolut de cesser la
                        chasse aux phoques et de se rendre immédiatement à San Francisco. Le
                        commandant du croiseur russe, avant de laisser partir le capitaine du
                        schooner, lui avait donné un avertissement, par lequel, d’après le capitaine
                        Lutjens, on lui ordonna de cesser la chasse aux phoques et de rentrer chez
                        lui, tandis que, d’après la Partie défenderesse, l’avertissement ne
                        contenait que la défense de chasser dans les eaux territoriales russes;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que la Partie défenderesse a reconnu que, bien que dans les
                        conditions où a été rencontré le schooner Kate and Anna et après la
                        vérification de ses papiers de bord, le commandant du croiseur russe ait eu
                        des raisons sérieuses de considérer le bâtiment américain comme très-suspect
                        et même de conclure qu’une partie au moins du produit de sa chasse avait été
                        obtenue d’une manière illicite dans les eaux territoriales de la Russie,
                        cependant la mise en liberté du bâtiment lui-même, après la saisie du
                        chargement qui le rendit suspect, témoigne d’un manque de conséquence dans
                        les décisious du croiseur, à expliquer en partie par l’absence de preuves
                        positives de la culpabilité du capitaine Lutjens; et par conséquent la
                        Partie défenderesse, conformément à son désir de maintenir en toute occasion
                        ses relations amicales avec le Gouvernement américain, s’est déclarée prête
                        à se reconnaître obligée de donner une indemnité pour les pertes réelies qui
                        ont été causées par le fait regrettable relatif au schooner Kate and
                        Anna;</p>
                    <p>Attendu toutefois que la Partie défenderesse soutient que le montant des
                        dommages-intérêts qu’on est en droit de réclamer d’elle ne s’élève qu’au
                        montant de $1,240 (pour les 124 peaux de phoques à $10), avec les intérêts a
                        6 pour cent par an depuis le 12 août 1892;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que la Partie demanderesse prétend qu’elle est en droit de
                        réclamer non-seulement le montant du prix des 124 peaux de phoques
                        illégalement confisquées, mais également la perte de prise probable de 625
                        peaux, en se basant sur ce fait qu’après que le schooner Kate and Anna avait
                        été arrêté, le capitaine a résolu de ne pas continuer la chasse, mais de
                        retourner immédiatement à San Francisco et que cette résolution aurait été
                        la conséquence de l’avertissement que le commandant du croiseur russe lui
                        avait donné;</p>
                    <p>Considérant que, quelle qu’ait été la teneur de cet avertissement, il ne
                        pouvait avoir pour effet d’empêcher le capitaine du schooner Kate and Anna
                        de continuer la chasse aux phoques et que, par conséquent, si ledit
                        capitaine a néanmoins résolu de retourner directement à San Francisco, la
                        Partie défenderesse n’est pas responsable de la perte de gain qui en est
                        résulté pour le schooner;</p>
                    <p>Considérant par rapport à l’indemnité due pour la confiscation des <pb
                            n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0510"/>124 peaux de phoques, que la Partie
                        demanderesse réclame $14 par peau, que la partie défenderesse offre $10 per
                        peau, mais qu’il est juste de fixer l’indemnité à $12 par peau, soit $1,488
                        pour les 124 peaux;</p>
                    <p>Par ces motifs,</p>
                    <p>L’Arbitre décide et prononce ce qui suit:</p>
                    <p>La Partie défenderesse paiera à la Partie demanderesse pour le compte des
                        réclamations présentées par les ayants-droit dans l’affaire du Kate and
                        Anna, la somme de $1,488 des Etats-Unis d’Amérique, avec les intérêts de
                        cette somme à 6 pour cent par an, depuis le 12 août 1892 jusqu’au jour du
                        paiement intégral.</p>
